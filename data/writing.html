            <p>I live in Cairo but I was not born here. I inherited this  citizenship from my father. </p>
            <p>Foreign to my inherited territories, I learn to make home in  collections, arranged particularly. So I enter Bibliothek Andreas Züst as I enter another’s home; while my host is absent, I can discern him here in the logic of his collection. </p>
            <p>I spent the first thirty years of my life in the United States, where I got my education in literature,  history, theory, politics, art. My teachers introduced me to a North American and European canon. Now, after more than seven years in Egypt, being in Züst’s library is a return to a past personal context — a sort of going home. I'm back with Allen Ginsberg, Emmett Williams, Dieter Roth, and Claude Cahun, but I've changed.</p>
            <p>The artists and writers represented in the collection are almost entirely European and North American. The modest assemblages of books on Asian, African, and Arab topics are largely written from outsider perspectives.</p>

            <p>Early in the first of my two weeks at the Bibliothek, I pull out a photo book near a window with an idyllic view. It is <a href="https://withoutsanctuary.org/" target="_blank">Lynching Photography in America</a>. I browse through it and soon move to a table to give the images the focus I think they deserve.
            <p>Looking at these photographs is being transported to a home of sinister familiarity. I am looking carefully, in a failing attempt to find respect, I try to be thorough in my study. I notice that my gaze is not trained on the limp, maimed bodies that are each image’s focus. I am looking at the spectators.</p> 
            <p>I am struck by the familiarity of their faces; the relaxed way they inhabit their living bodies, as if at a carnival in the town square. The morning after finding the book, I photograph an alternate archive, erasing the gruesome spectacle that has brought these white bodies together, keeping only the images of the murderous spectators.</p>

            <p>For two days, I don't go back into the library. Now I want to find a book about Africa, written by an African. Africa is not far, just a short plane ride. A trip I took only a few nights ago. To get back to Africa, I take a book off the shelf in the Africa section. It has a hard cover with no jacket. <a href="#chap1">I read it.</a></p>

            <p>I'm in Chicago, and thinking about LoBagola's book. I take the El to the Harold Washington Library, and find the book on the shelf.</p>
