<p></p><p>Bata Kindai Amgoza ibn LoBagola and the Making of An African Savage’s Own Story
</p><p>by David Killingray and Willie Henderson</p><p> LoBagola’s major occupation was as an entertainer. He was a skillful and intriguing storyteller, and truth and falsehood are elaborately woven into his autobiography.</p><p> Melville J. Herskovits, one of the few professional Africanists to review the book, was scathing in the Nation: “The internal evidence indicates that this self-termed ‘savage’ not only did not lead the early life he says he did, but that he never went very far into the interior of West Africa, and could have visited the coastal region only casually.</p><p> LoBagola was not an African and his book, like much of his life, was a clever misrepresentation, but this does not mean that either man or book should be hastily dismissed…the fact that an ‘ordinary’ man wrote about an ‘extraordinary’ life raises interesting questions about autobiography and about who can have a ‘life’ or distinctive voice in the historical record…LoBagola constructed an individual life under very difficult circumstances, and this may tell us something about fractured lives in general.</p><p> In a brief letter to the Consul at Dakar, Alfred F. Whitman, Supervisor of Agents for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children... described LoBagola as, “a very unusual negro who claims to have been educated at the University of Edinburgh. He professes a strong desire to help the people of his native land and pretends to be making a specialty of our systems of education so that he may introduce a proper one into Dahomey.”</p><p> Throughout his autobiography nakedness is used as a metaphor, and the notion of ‘savage’ is ironic and carries with it echoes of ‘the noble savage.’</p><p> The book is punctuated with stark contrasts: raw and cooked, naked and clothed, clean and dirty, savage and civilized, natural and unnatural, truth and deceit, pure and impure, moral and amoral, black and white.</p><p> LoBagola’s sense of being different has a number of dimensions, including race, religion and sexual orientation. His life as he tells it is about ‘deceit’ but also about flight, a recurrent theme being a series of ‘escapes’ from mounting personal problems.</p><p> Civilization has merely clothed LoBagola in deceit.</p><p> His subsequent descriptions of the ‘Ondo Bush’ and forest region foodstuffs, his references to Yoruba words and institutions, and also the Dahomean social and political structures, describe an area that LoBagola certainly visited, possible on more than one occasion. The jumble of cultural bits and pieces with which he describes this part of the West African coast could have been drawn from that experience and from random culling of information from a variety of popular travel books.</p><p> The tenor and the language of the book may reflect the audience at which it was directed, one that was dissatisfied with colonial literature and which demanded to read ‘authoritative’ tales of Africa told by authentic Africans who really knew the continent. Certainly it would seem that the book pandered to and helped to reinforce a range of prejudices and stereotypical views held by whites about Africa and Africans.</p><p> Living exhibits were prominent in the University of Pennsylvania Museum program of anthropology, as one local newspaper briefly reported, accompanying the story with two photographs of 'Amgoza,' who 'parades around halls in native costume much to the amusement of students.</p><p> In the autobiography, LoBagola moves people and events around to fabricate his story.</p><p> The autobiography recounts three ‘return’ visits to West Africa before the 1920s: a childhood visit c. 1900, which is obviously false, and trips in 1907-08 and in 1911-12. LoBagola probably made the 1907-08 visit as a seaman from the United States. Whether he travelled in the interior of West Africa as he claimed is not known. It seems unlikely that on that occasion he entertained the Alake Gbadebo, the Egba ruler, by singing Harry Lauder’s music hall song, “Stop yer tickling, Jock,” or that the adventures recounted in his book are in any way true.</p><p> LoBagola’s role as an entertainer in Lagos in 1911-12 can be supported by documentary evidence...He mentioned that he met in Lagos, or had met earlier, David Taylor and also William Shita [sic], a prosperous Kruman with a general merchandise store in Balogun Street, who 'secured me a place to stay with a very fine family of native Christians, by the name of Savage' in Olowobowo, Lagos </p><p> David Taylor had a ‘general merchandise store on the Marina’ in Lagos.</p><p> Also met in Lagos the Vaughan brothers, and Dr. Orisdipe Obasa, the physician and politican who was son-in-law to the merchant R.B. Blaize. </p><p> May 1912: performed at Glover Memorial Hall, the Lagos Standard favorably reviewed.</p><p> Origins of the “publicly flogged” story might be:</p><p> March 1912 – Zaria flogging incident, reported in the Lagos Standard, when two African gov’t clerks named Hall and Taylore were stripped naked and publicly flogged.</p><p> May 1914 – Bauchi flogging which led to the Fitzgerald libel case in London in November 1919.</p><p> This role of African cultural informant, or whatever, was short-lived. LoBagola’s real skill, and the source of his income, was on the stage doing a ‘native dance, in native costume, and a fire-dance; then making a quick change into a Scottish kilt and singing Scottish songs. Another accomplishment, clearly a successful one, was as ‘The Fireproof Man,’ which led to theater bookings ‘all over the eastern part of the United States, and it seemed as if my star were in the ascendant.’</p><p> February 1933, his New York agent James B. Pond, urged him to be careful: “We have had a letter of complaint from Bluffton, Ohio, and we have done what we can to smooth things there for you. For heaven’s sake be careful or you won’t be able to stay in Bluffton. We can take care of the question with regard to your identity, but we can do nothing if you start being indiscreet with the boys who hear you lecture and who worship you. You went to Bluffton to escape the color line, but you have already aroused suspicions in other lines.” </p><p> Years later when LoBagola was asked why he had taken out citizenship papers, he replied: ‘In order to always be sure that I would have the protection of my country abroad. I was parading under the name of Lo Bagola and I wanted something to fall back on in the event of any injustices.’</p><p> The Army Department confidentially passed a report to the Commissioner of Naturalization in 1932:  LoBagola suffered from a “constitutional psychopathic state, paranoid personality; history indicates sexual perversion covering an unknown length of time; was arrested on several occasions for practicing unnatural acts; claims that he is hounded from place to place, that he is the victim of an organized plot to keep him from pursuing his vocation, and that the charges of perversion are false.” (244)  -Footnote 45. Bridges to War Dept.</p><p> According to this letter, LoBagola had been company clerk for Sergeant-Major Richardson at Kantara. Richardson wrote that LoBagola, “who the world always treated badly,” was laughed at by his fellow soldiers because “you wanted to be repatriated to Palestine.” He also referred to LoBagola’s abilities to imitate the Scottish singer Harry Lauder and his participation in concerts on the troop ship to Britain.</p><p> LoBagola’s talks were on African life and customs, which, whatever his origins, he could now give with a degree of authenticity that satisfied his largely unsophisticated audiences. In all probability it is on these various audiences that he honed his imaginary and exotic African background which would then appear in his autobiography.</p><p> Through talks came to the attention of Scribner’s and Dr. Frederick Houk Law, head of English at NY’s Stuyvesant High School</p><p> James B. Pond in a letter to Dr. Law, 21 March 1930: 'I think the time has come when he [LoBagola] can stand more vigorous exploitation.' </p><p> The firm of James B. Pond had been in the business of promoting 'African' entertainment for decades. Pond’s father acted as agent for H.M. Stanley on his lecture tour of the US in the 1890s</p><p> LoBagola on his presentations after 1932: 'I tell how I came to write the whole story in the beginning and I emphasize the beauty of the ‘struggle,’ pointing out that ‘struggle begets strength’ and people just fall over themselves with interest. There is a new note in my tone, a kind of pleading bitterness which catches instantly.'</p><p> News of his parole and of his prison record leaked out — he was rarely discreet in what he said or how he behaved — rumors were spread, and promised engagements were cancelled. It was time to move on.</p><p> In Attica the prison authorities registered LoBagola as having the mental age of thirteen and an intelligence quotient of eighty-seven, but at the time official IQ tests were invariably heavily loaded against African-Americans.</p><p> LoBagola was able to exploit his blackness in a way that opened doors that would otherwise have been closed to an African American. In the process he was able to fool a whole range of professional people in the white establishment. Undoubtedly he was exploited, but he also exploited others by his talent for imitation and presentation.</p><p> The series of flights which make up the major part of his autobiography, and of his life as he lived it, were not a consequence of his identity as an African but of his underlying and disturbed personality. His African ‘mask’ represents an imaginative flight, an escape into a fantasy world, lived out as real. His attempt to justify his own deep-seated confusions and inner tensions by claiming to be a ‘savage’ outsider has pathetic appeal. In one powerful image he can gather together the various fragments of his life in a way that both asserts his dignity and shifts the blame: a fractured and disturbed life made coherent, but not healed, by an appeal to an African identity.</p><p> Many black entertainers pretended to be Africans and performed 'tricked out in all the paraphernalia of imposture.' LoBagola played the African prince, a fire-eater, a savage bewildered by modernization, the clown, and much else, but he could also turn his hand to the straight act as singer, Scottish comic, or if necessary, the urbane and disciplined speaker who entranced high school students and well-heeled members of smart bourgeois clubs and confraternities.</p><p> LoBagola did come up against racial hostility and abuse, but he met this by boldly maintaining his stage life and by claiming that he was an African and not a black American.
