<p></p><p>For hundreds of years after the arrival of Columbus, the most frequently invoked explanation for the origin of the indigenous populations of the American continents, north and south, was that they were the Lost Tribes of Israel. </p><p> Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough (1795-1837): “the celebrated Las Casas entertained no doubt that the continent of America had in early ages been colonized by the Jews; and he even goes so far as to say that the language of the Island of San Domingo was ‘corrupt Hebrew’.  </p><p> Francisco Lopez de Gomara (1511-1564) noted of the native population of South America: “They are all very like Jews in appearance and voice, for they have large noses and speak through the throat.” The Indians, according to Torquemada, to, were literally of Israelite stock, biologically Jews, and had been persuaded by the devil to worship him in South America, in a similar manner to their worship of God in ancient Israel. Moreover, it soon became axiomatic that most if not all the local languages were dialects of Hebrew and other Jewish languages. </p><p> Major General Daniel Gookin (1612-1687), a settler in Massachussetts in 1644 – Historical Collections of the Indians of New England (1674) – “this people are of the race of the Ten Tribes of Israel…as many learned men think.” </p><p> William Penn: Their eye is little and black not unlike a straight-looked Jew… their language is lofty, yet narrow, but like the Hebrew in signification; like short-hand in writing, one word serveth in the place of three…For their origin I am ready to believe them of the Jewish race; I mean of the stock of the Ten Tribes, and that for the following reasons; first they were to go to a “land not planted or known” which, to be sure, Asia and Africa were, if not Europe; and He that intended that extraordinary judgment upon them, might make the passage not uneasy to them, as it is not impossible in itself, from the Easternmost parts of Asia, to the Westernmost of America. In the next place, I find them of like countenance, and their children of so lively a resemblance, that a man would think himself in Duke’s Place or Bury Street in London, where he seeth them. But this is not all; they agree in rites, they reckon by moons; they offer their first fruits, they have a kind of Feast of Tabernacles; they are said to lay their altar upon twelve stones; their mourning a year, customs of women, with many things that do not now occur.  </p><p> British Israelism and its American counterpart, which became both influential and numerically important by the end of the nineteenth century, and which still have a significant following, perceived the white population of the British Isles and the United States as being quite literally and biologically descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. In some versions of this ideology, actual Jews were regarded as impostors. (68-9)</p><p> Edward Hine (1825-1891), perhaps the most influential proponent of Anglo-Israelism: “We have literally fulfilled Israel’s mission by pushing the aborigines of our colonies to the ends of what was once their own country, as we require more room, so do we push, drive them into corners. This we have done to the Caffres, the Maoris, the Bushmen of Australia…All our aborigines are positively dying out, gradually but surely, before us.” For Hine the extinction of non-Israelite lesser breeds was a proof of the destiny of Anglo-Saxons to be heirs to the promise of the Bible. </p><p> Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Lost Tribes ideas circulated in newspapers, pamphlets, and books; were spread from the pulpits of American churches; and no doubt reached black audiences at first or second hand. </p><p> Blacks were ignored by American whites in their construction of Lost Tribes identities not least because the position was already filled. Some Lost Tribes ideas in an Anglo-Israelite guise, however, fed into the emergence of Pentecostalism, which would eventually have a powerful impact upon the blacks of America, particularly through the teaching of Charles Fox Parham (1873-1929), who led the great revival in Topeka, Kansas, in 1901, one of the key moments in the development of the Pentecostal movement. </p><p> [W.F.] Carrothers [lawyer who worked alongside Parham in the early Pentecostal movement] argued that throughout history of the world races had never mixed, and it was the fault of slavery that in the United States, blacks and whites had been forced, in recent times, into a promiscuous and unfortunate proximity. However, the Holy Spirit had come to the rescue by creating, particularly in whites, a deep sense of racial revulsion, which had the effect of keeping blacks and whites apart. Racial bigotry was not at all the work of the devil, as some claimed, but the working out of the divine will. </p><p> Pentecostal Church of the Living God, 1903, Steel Springs, Tennessee – maintained that most of the biblical prophets, including Jesus, were members of the black race. (71-2)</p><p> 1906 – Pentecostalism spread through black churches, in Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas</p><p> For many blacks the idea of being able to shed their skin and become racially white through the adoption of a Jewish racial identity seemed attractive. Father Divine, the charismatic cult leader, famously abolished race for his followers—the concept was not allowed. There was no black or white, and words such as “Negro” or “nigger” were banned. Others tried to “pass” in white society. Various Muslim groups, such as the Moorish Science movement, similarly maintained that American blacks were Asiatics, and they refused to be categorized as blacks. To distance themselves from the hated appellation of “nigger,” they awarded each other honorific Muslim titles such as “bey.” </p><p> Charles Pennington, formerly enslaved (1807-1870) – A Text Book of the Origin and History &c. of the Colored People (1841), mentioned in passing that there were black Jews on the coast of Africa who had originally come from Judea. </p><p> Africanus Horton (1835-1883) </p><p> The Bible and its stories then were used both as a way of justifying slavery and racist attitudes, and also as a means of defending against them. </p><p> Motifs of hope, revenge, and deliverance, such as the opening of the Red Sea to allow the Israelites to escape and their enemies to drown, the defeat of Goliath by David, the building of Noah’s Ark as a means of avoiding destruction, the vengeance wreaked by a blinded Sampson upon his sadistic tormentors, all fed into the construction of a new metaphorical identity in which black slaves increasingly imagined themselves as Israelites, toiling in a North American Egypt, brutalized by North American pharaohs, awaiting their Moses who would take them to freedom’s land. </p><p> Spirituals: “When Israel Was in Egypt’s Land”  
“Wade in the Water” – referring to the crossing of the Red Sea and famously sung by Harriet Tubman as a warning to runaway slaves to stick to the water to put pursuing dogs off their scent. </p><p> Some of these Bible stories were transmitted by Muslim slaves—who related the Quranic versions of the Hebrew narratives. In the Quran, Moses was emphasized as the supreme deliverer, and the story of the splitting of the waters of the Red Sea was described in loving detail. </p><p> Deliverance from bondage, the bondage of Egypt, is one of the great themes in the Old Testament, and it was one that had great resonance for America’s black slave population. </p><p> Marcus Garvery (1887-1940), known as “the black Moses”
Harriet Tubman (1820-1913), known as the Moses of the Underground Railroad</p><p> William Laurence DeLaurence – The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses (c. 1900) – a manual of magic that claims to divulge the kabbalistic secrets of Moses and the ancient Hebrews in general. </p><p> Charleston was the second-biggest concentration of Jews in North America at the time of the 1790 census. There were 188 Jews in Charleston and only 242 in New York, which was the biggest concentration. </p><p> After the wave of Jewish immigration that followed the Russian pogroms of the 1880s and occasionally before, African Americans often found themselves in the same towns and cities, sometimes even neighborhoods, as Jews. The Jews were relatively more prospersous and may have been emulated in part fro this reason. </p><p> In the Yiddish and English-language Jewish press, African Americans were often referred to as the “Jews of America.” (metaphorical, invoking shared suffering) </p><p> The symbiosis between the groups sometimes took the form of changing places, almost of changing skins, as one group graphically adopted the guise of the other. </p><p> One Jewish observer noted that:
the negro Jews of Harlem claim to be full-blooded Jews of color. They use the Orthodox prayer book, and pray in the same sing-song voice that one is accustomed to hear in the sunagogues of Eastern Europe. Even the herring, favorite food of poor Lithuanians, has found its way into the dining of these Negro Jews. There it has attained a prominence never reached among white Jews—it has become almost a part of the ritual. </p><p> Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor famously sang black southern songs in blackface, explicitly changing skins, and although this has been taken as demeaning to African Americans, such was probably not the intention at the time. Indeed, as Jews were widely regarded as black—or at least as not white—the adoption of blackface may be read in a number of ways. In part it was creating a bridge to whiteness by loudly proclaiming the necessity for Jews to paint their faces black in order to be black. Taking the practice more literally, a reviewer for the American Yiddish newspaper the Daily Forwards asked: “Is there any incongruity in the Jewish boy [Al Jolson] with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. I detected again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the wail of the Chazan, the wail of anguish of a people who have suffered. The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world’s history.” </p><p> Jews anxious to assimilate into white America were haunted with the fear that they were not white themselves. </p><p> In general terms the black Judaic religions that were created in the United States did not need and ultimately did not always seek legitimation by mainstream Jewry. </p><p> Afrocentric ideas had appealed to American blacks since the first half of the nineteenth century. Books glorifying the African past and emphasizing the key role of Africans in the great civilizations of the ancient world, particularly Egypt, were produced in considerable numbers by black Africans from the 1830s on. </p><p> Pennington: 
The first general fact is that the arts and sciences had their origins with our ancestors and from them have flown forth to the world. They gave them to Greece, Greece to Rome, and Rome to others.</p><p> Henry Mcneam Turner (1834-1915), bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church:
Why should not the Negro believe that he resembles God as much as other people? We do not believe there is any hope for a race of people who do not believe that they look like God.</p><p> The importance of Ethiopia as a symbol of black pride was emphasized in 1896 with the success of black Ethiopian troops against a European colonial power at the battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopians massacred the heavily outnumbered Italians. This was the first time that an African country had successfully resisted a serious attempt to invade it. </p><p> William Christian, b. 1856 in Mississippi, founder of a church in Wrightsville, Arkansas (Church of the Living God) – message that Adam, King David and King Solomon, Job, Jeremiah, Moses’s wife, the Queen of Sheba, and Jesus Christ were all black. His church has been termed the first “black supremacy” organization in the United States </p><p> Father Divine, (Bisop John A. Hickerson, aka Bishop Saint John the Vine) identified completely as Ethiopian, founded the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth, taught a version of New Thought, a spiritual movement that started in the 1830s in England and the U.S. </p><p> Psalms 68:31: Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</p><p> 1930 – coronation of Haile Selassie</p><p> Falasha/Beta Israel – Ethiopians of Jewish faith
brought to the attention of the West through Bruce’s Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile</p><p> Jacques Faitlovitch (1881-1955), champion of the Beta Israel among world Jewry, visited the US several times after 1911</p><p> Howard Brotz – The Black Jews of Harlem</p><p> Jose V. Malcioln – The African Origins of Modern Judaism</p><p> Sometimes African Americans would identify with Ethiopia to the extent that they would pass themselves off literally and insistently as Ethiopian Jews. Some such were seen preaching in Chicago in 1913. One of them told the publisher of the Weekly Defender, a black Chicago newspaper, that he had come from Abyssinia to lead the blacks of Chicago to an understanding of their true Jewish African heritage and that he planned to rebuild Solomon’s Temple. Calling themselves the International Peace and Brotherly Love Movement, these “Abyssinian Jews” offered to give lectures about their homeland and home community and hoped to convince Chicago’s white Jews that the real Jews were black. </p><p> Hebrew Settlement Workers (Harlem): The group’s leaders claimed to be from Palestine and Ethiopia and had come to bring the Torah to American’s black population, who were the only authentic Jews in the world. </p><p> Commandment Keepers of the Royal Order of Aethiopian Hebrews, the congregation led by Wentworth Arthur Matthew (aka Falaysan Order of African Jews, Union of Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation and Rabbis led by C.M. Cragg, Temple Society of Ethiopian Hebrews, Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation </p><p> Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation (still active) – oldest temple in the Chicago area serving the Israelite community, established as Ethiopian Hebrew Association in 1915 </p><p> Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations – founded 1886 in Chattanooga, Tennessee by Prophet Frank S. Cherry - Whereas all blacks were not Jews, all true Jews were black. White Jews were impostors. </p><p> Church of the God and Saints of Christ, led by Prophet William Saunders Crowdy (1847-1908) – blacks were quite literally the chosen people—their role in the divine plan was not a metaphor, it was the historical truth that had been divinely ordained. </p><p> In 1903 Crowdy sent emissaries abroad to South Africa and also to Cuba and the West Indies – the large and quite influential black Jewish community in Rusape, Zimbabwe can be traced back directly to his movement (90-91)</p><p> Warren Roberson founded in 1900 the Temple of the Gospel of the Kingdom in Virginia, they moved to Harlem in 1917, where he established a sort of commune which he called a “kingdom.” Later another “kingdom” was created in Atlanta, which was accused of being a “baby farm” where women members of his congregation bore Roberson’s children. The community collapsed when Roberson was indicted on a charge of transporting women over state lines for immoral purposes. </p><p> Rabbi Leon Richlieu, Brooklyn, in 1899 founded the Moorish Zionist Temple – claimed to be of Ethiopian origin. Mordechai Herman later reformed the group and set up branches in Philadelphia and Newark </p><p> Ethiopia, Thou Land of Our Fathers – the Garveyite national anthem, which NY Yiddish newspapers called “the Negro Hatvikah” – written by Arnold Josiah Ford, who developed an eclectic religion which drew liberally on magic, kabbalah, Islam, Judaism, Pentecostalism, and Freemasonry. Most of the congregation claimed to be of “Ethiopian” origin… Many of the hymns he composed not only demonstrated a fusion and synthesis of metaphorical analogies between the Jewish and black historical experience, but also included Ethiopianism and the redemption of Africa… Ford died of a heart attack, on the piece of land acquired by him [in Ethiopia], at the age of fifty-eight, during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (91-3)</p><p> Harlem and Addis Ababa as the capitals of the black world – “Ford’s remarkable attempt to bridge the divide between the two was inspirational. He did it largely through the trope of Beta Israel / Falasha, which was a synthesis of several previous ideas: that blacks were the real Jews descended from Ethiopians and that blacks were descended from or trlated to black Jews inhabiting the coasts or interior of the African continent.” </p><p> Wentworth A. Matthew: claimed to be born in a small Falasha village in Lagos, Nigeria, grandson of a famous Falasha preacher. A newspaper article later mentioned that he had a knowledge of Hebrew, which he spoke “with an Arabic accent… it is Palestinian Hebrew that he speaks, pure Hebrew,” which he maintained had been spoken in that distant Falasha village in Lagos. </p><p> In the first few decades of the twentieth century, Bata Kindai Amgoza ibn LoBagola (1877-1947), a self-proclaimed African, made a good living out of his knowledge of this exotic discourse [of Jews in Africa], which he had studied in part in London libraries, where he may have got some details for his tale in the writings of the Scottish explorer Mungo Park. There is also common ground between his account and Olaudah Equiano’s The Interesting Narrative. Equiano maintained that he was born, the son of a chief, around 1745 in an area called “Eboe” in Guinea and at the age of eleven was seized and put on a slave ship. LoBagola claimed to be from “the village of Nodaghusa, six hundred miles north of Abomey Calavi, and about forty five days’ walk north of the Gulf of Guinea, and three days’ walk south of the native city of Timbuktu.” His village was in the Ondo Bush, “a horrible place, because of its tall grass and bushes,” and he too was the son of a chief, and he too was taken off to Britain, against his will, on a British ship. LoBagola had absorbed the ancient and more recent discourse about Jews and Israelites in black Africa, and he gave the idea a new lease of life in America and elsewhere.</p><p> His Ondo bush was a place thus far undiscovered by whites, where black Jews lived a free and pious existence, without the inconvenience of clothes, celebrating their ancient traditions in an only slightly heterodox form. In 1929 he published some articles about his adventures and about African Judaism, in the illustrated Scribner’s Magazine, and the following year Knopf published these in book form under the title LoBagola: an African Savage’s Own Story. The book made quite a splash, and for a while it was much discussed. Knopf gave a launch party for LoBagola, which was attended by Knopf authors like James Weldon Johnson, Carl Van Vechten, H.L. Mencken, Henry Siedel Canby, and Dashiell Hammett. In a favorable review, Time Magazine observed: “A black man but a Jew, he is a native of the Ondo bush, hinterland of Dahomey, in western Africa. His people, according to legend, left Palestine after Roman Titus sacked Jerusalem (70 CE), whereupon they fled to Morocco, to Timbuktu, and farther. There, swallowed up by African natives, they still remained a Jewish sect, continued Jewish rites. Says LoBagola: they carry out the ceremony of circumcision to the letter, “although no in the say way as in Palestine today. Our rabbis,” he said, “permit us to use only our teeth and fingernails for the circumcision operation.” His book was full of remarkable details about his Jews of the Ondo bush and his own adventures. In Ondo the naked Jews spoke “a dialect of Arabic, mixed with a great deal of Hausa, Yoruba, and Benga vernaculars.” His book explained how as a result of some extraordinary mishaps LoBagola finished up in Scotland, where he stayed for a while learning English. Time Magazine, which did not seem to have any difficulty believing the account of the Jews of the Ondo bush, described LoBagola as a kind of elderly black Marx brother—“short, stocky, gleaming-eyes, with black mustache, frizzy white hair”—and concluded he “looks like a stout little Jew in blackface.” It appears that LoBagola was taken seriously by most people at the time. He traveled the world, dressed up in a pastiche of African costume, bare chest adorned with many necklaces and a big ring through his nose, giving lectures, featuring in ethnographic exhibitions that were popular at the time, and instructing urban students of anthropology about the savage and exotic life he had known at first hand in his native Ondo. His real biography was somewhat more mundane. His actual name was Joseph Howard Lee, and he had been born to a dirt-poor African American family in Baltimore.</p><p> One of the dupes of LoBagola was none other than the pioneering anthropologist R.R. Marett, the reader in social anthropology at Exeter College, Oxford, who virtually founded anthropology as a university subject in Great Britain. In 1911 LoBagola gave a talk at Exeter College on fetishism, which he recalled “made a hit,” and in the same year was a living exhibit at the University of Pennsylvania Museum (“by far the best exhibit at the Museum”). Joseph Howard Lee, aka LoBagola, selected a Jewish racial identity as a way of avoiding the prejudice that was attached to being racially an African American and a way of appropriating the “best” kind of African origins, according to Hamitic theory, from one of the places where black Jews were thought to reside. LoBagola’s fantastical account has quite incredibly entered academic literature as fact. His narrative started to take on the cloak of academic respectability in 1930 with a review of his book in the Journal of the Royal African Society by an Africa “expert.” The review did not question the authenticity of LoBagola’s story, nor did it interrogate the critical assertion that there were naked black Jews in the Ondo bush. It was only the mildly anti-colonial stance of the book that was queried. More recently, in the Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture, we read that “some accounts place west African Jewish communities in the Ondo Forest of Dahomei south of Timbuktu: in the 1930s these groups still maintained a Torah scroll written in Aramaic that had been burned into parchment with a hot iron instead of ink so it could not be changed.” But the editor, Avrum Ehrlich, is by no means the only one to have unwittingly perpetuated this most egregious example of the Jews in west Africa topos.</p><p> It is of some interest and significance that Williams’s influential Hebrewisms of West Africa and LoBagola’s An African Savage’s Own Story were both published in 1930, the year of Ford’s departure for Africa. LoBagola’s “Orientalist” account of wild Jewish goings-on in the African bush had been published in Scribner’s the year before his departure. One can only wonder whether the description of a patriarchal society with few constraints,  at least on men (one of LoBagola’s chapters was called “Six Girls at Once”), had played into Ford’s decision to go, had colored his sense of what he would find when he got there, and if his decision to take four concubines and a wife was based in any way on the great impostor LoBagola’s fictitious five wives (one, you may recall, was sent off, mutilated, to join the Jewish kind’s Amazon cohorts.)</p><p> (95-98)</p><p> Institute for Jewish Community Research – founded by Chicago-based African American rabbi Capers C. Funny Jr. It was an outreach organization in part to the Igbo in Nigeria. </p><p> On one dramatic occasion in 2002, a group of Igbo émigrés met on the small island of St. Simons, Georgia, at the so-called Ibo Landing, where thirteen chained-up Ibo slaves just arrived from Africa threw themselves into the sea and drowned rather than live in servitude. This sad story gave rise to the slave narrative of “The Flying Negro”, which is grounded in the respect American slaves had for native-born Africans and involves a group of Igbo people flying back to Africa from a slave ship. But Rabbi Funnye situates the story in a different tradition. He wrote:
I was invited to speak and I could only compare what I was witnessing to a true awakening of Ibo people to their Hebraic cultural roots. As I thought about why we were in St. Simons Island, Georgia, my mind returned to an episode in Jewish history concerning the Jews at Masada, who…cast themselves from the walls of their fortress rather than come under the control of the Roman Empire. I was inspired by the history of the thirteen Ibo men, who were led by a chief of the Ibo nation, to revolt and become martyrs rather than slaves.
