<p>4. ALIEN/NATION Re-Imagining the Black Body (Politic) in Williams and Walker’s In Dahomey</p><p> Were it not for the consternation of British theatre-goers, the Bert Williams and George Walker breakthrough black musical In Dahomey would not have been forced to begin where it previously had ended. But following its debut at London’s Shaftesbury Theatre in the spring of 1903, the splashy Pan-Africanist extravaganza was given a quick face-lift to appease its audiences. Having conquered a skeptical Broadway public in the fall of 1902, the Williams and Walker Company decided to launch its tour of Britain in the heart of London’s theatre world. Billed as a historic production staged completely by "real coons" from America, In Dahomey had already generated a fine amount of publicity which had focused primarily on the anomalous spectacle of its all-black cast. The press trumpeted the arrival of African American performers in a musical of their own making and encouraged the public to attend the production, if only to observe the odd miracle of African American theatre. Curious and remarkable in form and content, In Dahomey greeted its audiences with a flurry of sound and movement on its opening night. Flaunting a vast array of colorful contradictions, the musical sparked a rather startling cultural contradiction. A renegade production both stunningly seductive and yet mystifying and untranslatable to audiences, In Dahomey was forced to end with an ad-hoc version of "God Save the King" in order to assuage the "confusion" of its British audiences.</p><p> A Rumble in the Jungle</p><p> Much of that confusion erupted in response to In Dahomey’s original ending, a lavish scene which featured a pantomime-transformation act, Victorian theatre’s popular ritual involving elaborate costuming and spectacular technology designed to transform the stage into a site of fanciful upheaval and carnivalesque disruption. The crux of Victorian pantomime was its celebration of metamorphosis, and the form consistently provided an "occasion for masquerade, disguise and processions," as well as "role-reversal [and] gender-switching." Delightfully familiar to British theatre-goers, pantomimes were a staple of Victorian culture and its persistent obsession with transmutability and "patterns of conversion."≤ But Williams and Walker’s use of the form as a punctuation mark for their three-hour musical confounded many Britons. Situated, according to one incredulous British critic, in an "exotic" locale amid verdant scenery with "mud swamps" and "grinning skulls," the concluding scene clearly re-animated popular theatre’s spectacles of grand transformation for audiences who were invited to gaze upon a darkened stage filled with chorus members adorned in camouflage costumes. Covered with leaves "to look like foliage of the swamp," the cast of In Dahomey used the site of a surreal "jungle" terrain to convert the lay of the land in pantomime. Transmogrifying from scenery into a song and dance revue, the chorus performed a splendiferous transformation of "Dahomey" for nonplused audiences who watched as the song "My Lady Frog" was sung "by two idealized lovers in frog costumes who float down the stream in a canoe."≥ Bodies out of swamps, swamps into bodies, this grand tableau created a brassy and colorful link between its characters and the African kingdom of elusive promise in the musical. In short, the cast of In Dahomey became Dahomey onstage.∂</p><p> Wondrously vibrant and flamboyant, In Dahomey’s original ending would seem appealing to Edwardian audiences well seasoned in the ways of spectacular theatre, thus making the English confusion with regard to the show’s finale all the more puzzling. For surely the musical’s extravagant, panoramic staging would have been familiar to British spectators who were ever seduced by the imperialistic rhetoric of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century popular culture. After all, theatre was, in a way, just one more outlet to a≈rm and negotiate systems of what Mary Louise Pratt describes as "territorial surveillance, appropriation of resources, and administrative control" over exoticized, colonial landscapes and their inhabitants. Dramatic productions in the second half of the nineteenth century particularly sustained what Michael Hays reads as the perpetual re-inscription of "fictions of English superiority." Such plays repeatedly offered images of distant territories that could be imaginatively annexed in the service of expanding the mere notion of an "imperial domain." Like the European explorer traipsing across a foreign territory, British patrons could enter the theatre with an "improving eye," encountering habitats as well as inhabitants who "must be produced as empty and unimproved"; for "the Eurocolonial future" is one predicated, as Pratt points out, "on absences and lacks of African life in the present."∑</p><p> Emerging out of this era, In Dahomey seemed on the surface to reproduce the Dahomey of the imperial imaginary, a land of unmarked and unmoving territories that encourage the spectator’s putative pleasure to conquer through the languid gaze of his or her roving eye/I. With marching Caboceers and magnificent Cannibal Kings in its cast of characters, the original third act transformation scene seemed theatrically to re-animate the prodigious work of early-nineteenth-century English explorers who did much to shape European perceptions of the African continent.∏ Yet despite its clear dependence on recycling the "Africa" of the white supremacist imagination, there were those English critics who ultimately recoiled from In Dahomey’s representation of a fanciful, sub-Saharan locale dominated by dancing frogs and transmogrifying swamp lands. Indeed, while several journalists argued that the pantomime scene was nothing short of anticlimactic and unimpressive, others waxed altogether mystified over what seemed to be the finale’s ba∆ing, absurdist imagery. One critic remarked that "the action of the piece is not In Dahomey until the last act, and when it gets there it goes all to pieces in a manner which is little short of bewildering." Added another, "when the scene changes to Africa, what thread of story there was is entirely lost sight of; and a succession of apparently irrelevant pictures of native life are given."</p><p> Missing from the closing sequence was the nostalgically rendered Africa of a bygone era, a prelapsarian province of Edenic native culture which the European spectator might weep over, even as he recognizes his complicity with the imperialist and systemic acts involved in conquering such territories. Rather, this Dahomian scene could only be posited by onlookers as supremely "strange," as a machination sustained in order solely to "show us the African unenslaved, the African in his native majesty, by way of contrast to the Americanized African" who travels the transatlantic divide toward the play’s end.∫ The pantomime scene would prove troublesome to some because the crux of the spectacle confirmed that this musical was anything but "nostalgic" in its rendering of African landscape. For the notion of the "putatively static savage societies" which serves as "a stable reference point for defining (the felicitous progress of ) civilized identity" metaphorically comes undone as a result of an oddly fanciful "rumble in the jungle." In the dense, green moving foliage of "Dahomey," the stasis of the "native" is set to unravel as "nature" and the racial paradigms attached to such a construct are transfigured and re-imagined through the mechanics of transatlantic theatre. In Dahomey’s pantomime act, then, ensured that this production would conclude with a distinctly flamboyant lack of closure.Ω</p><p> Yet In Dahomey’s infamous transformation scene, on the one hand, threatened to reinforce European fantasies of African atemporalism. Certainly the pantomime’s most startling images flirt with collapsing into what Anne McClintock reads as the "anachronistic space" so central to classic Eurocentric explorer narratives.≠ Williams and Walker were no doubt juggling dangerous representational forms as black entertainers at the turn of a new century. At the same time, I would argue that the racial dynamics of In Dahomey were distinct from the recognizable racial caricatures of nineteenth-century traveler tracts and blackface minstrel shows. In Dahomey’s "African scene" is different because of its fullness, rather than its emptiness, its "busy-ness" rather than its pedestrian structure, its sardonic subterfuge rather than its rudimentary barbarism. At its core, Williams and Walker’s musical set a precedent for yoking broad strokes of romantic whimsy with black political intent and activist vision. Indeed, the musical’s seeming "incoherence" to some is in fact a cue for us to pay close attention to the ways that this black theatrical production broke new ground and challenged the terms of representational coherency in relation to race.From its phantasmagoric ending to its large-scale, frenetically paced choruses, In Dahomey was a production that dared to couch new images of African American culture within the old. The musical imagined spectacles of black transformation and black plenitude and embedded those concepts in its libretto as well as in its song and dance. Even as the producers and performers ostensibly pandered to the demands of its audiences by resituating the last scene as a prologue, the musical held fast to the play of transformation and forecast its centrality as a theme that would course through the very heart of the production.</p><p> The pantomime sequence in Williams and Walker’s In Dahomey was, then, just the beginning of a series of disruptions along racial, gender, and national lines within the musical. It was a production founded on an abundance of figurative and literal instabilities. Little wonder, then, that a range of transatlantic critics nonetheless voiced their disappointment with the musical’s "thoroughly American and up-to-date quality," proclaiming that this was their "chief grievance against In Dahomey. . . . We thought it was to be ‘negro’ from beginning to end. . . . What we really get is negro-America. We do not get the negro in the rough . . . [but] Yankee veneer" (Green, "In Dahomey," 29). Indeed, a fair share of English and American critics took the production to task for not pandering to a more recognizable set of racial codes. Particularly in America, as theatre historian Henry T. Sampson reminds, numerous touring black musicals were "severely criticized by white critics for being insufficiently ‘Negroid.’ " The critical responses to In Dahomey illuminate the extent to which racial typology was already scripted in transatlantic theatre culture and the extent to which In Dahomey dissented from that typology.≤ 17.

As David Krasner has demonstrated in his study of turn-of-the-century black theatre, some of the earliest black musicals played with both re-inscribing and undoing racist tropes while also bearing the burden of their contiguity with a bygone (white) minstrelsy era. This chapter extends this sort of query by examining the bold and iconoclastic black musical theatre of the Williams and Walker Company at the turn of the century. Their complex and experimental musical In Dahomey (1902–4) serves as a critical example of African American cultural identity formation and performance politics in flux. Within this colorful landscape of change and transformation, I explore the textual and cultural volatility of this production in order to demonstrate the ways that In Dahomey operates as a musical that posed a series of complex representational inversions of race, gender, and nation.</p><p> Despite its textual sophistication, In Dahomey remains a play that is often dehistoricized and demetaphorized by contemporary critics who fail to read the daring and transgressive images running rampant in the production. Although Eric Sundquist suggests that "back-to-Africa musicals were mostly vaudeville routines transferred to a cardboard Africa, with virtually nothing African about them," below I suggest the ways that In Dahomey is not so muchabout literally being present "in Dahomey."≥ Instead, it is what happens in the brief yet startling transmutative sequences when one is "there" that serves as a catalyst and a recurring, figurative trope that repeatedly critiques and rewrites racial categories and conventional notions of identity formation. In Dahomey thrives less on a≈rming and reinforcing dominant racial caricatures and more on unmaking and challenging those very representations through contending with boundaries of self and black "nationhood." Given the wildly controversial spectacle at play’s end, the abrupt rendition of the British national anthem at curtain call suggests finally that the state had been (symbolically) summoned to restore order and coherency to the musical. It was left up to a spirited round of "God Save the King" to delimit the carnivalesque, supremely ambiguous, and radically unsettling elements of the first all-black musical to be produced in a major Broadway theatre and to be staged triumphantly in London’s theatre district.∂</p><p> "This Heterogeneous Yet Indivisible People":</p><p> Rupture and (Re)Vision in Turn-of-the-Century Black Theatre</p><p> To Sylvester Russell, In Dahomey’s pure and unadulterated international success was hardly in the air on September 8, 1902, the night of the musical’s stateside opening in Stamford, Connecticut. The leading voice of Gilded Age African American theatre criticism, Russell insisted that the musical had sparks of verve and promise, energy and originality, but he was also quick to identify the production’s uneven edges, its "draggy" first act, and its occasionally confusing visual scenarios. Russell adumbrated the comments of English critics when he wrote that the third act of In Dahomey was "a dramatic fiasco," a melange of incomprehensible plot developments and implausible twists. Writing for a black readership, he proclaimed that there is "not a literary merit to be found in a band of American Negroes taking a trip to Dahomey merely to bluff the people around them after they get there. We must remember that we belong to an oppressed race ourselves and Jesse Shipp must scratch his head and write the third act over again."∑ However infamous this closing act would later become, Russell’s early and explicit critique of In Dahomey’s denouement illustrates the extent to which Williams and Walker’s musical faced the dual demands and desires of black as well as white audiences. Russell’s admonition that African Americans must remember the conditions of their oppression in making and enjoying art bespeaks the rallying cry of racial uplift ideology. In an era of heightened black awareness of the mechanics of racial representation and during a period in which the originating seeds of the "New Negro" era were planted, Williams and Walker’s show debuted alongside multiple break-through innovations in black literature, poetry, visual art, photography, and essays. At the same time, however, key elements of the play remained disconcertingly archaic, owing as much to the more insipid forms of blackface minstrelsy as they did to late-nineteenth-century progressive art, music, dance, and fiction. As a result, the musical played fast and loose with conventional racial and gender images, walking a fine line between disrupting the master narratives of theatrical "race" performance and simultaneously capitulating to familiar and debilitating caricature.∏</p><p> In Dahomey’s disquieting double-vocality manifests a broader conflict in turn-of-the-century African American culture caught between ascribing to the ambitiously sweeping aesthetics of black nationalist writers such as Pauline Hopkins and Sutton Griggs and struggling to get up from under the shadow of old minstrel forms that Sam Lucas and others had worked in as a way to gain entrance to the stage. Even as "politically minded" novelists such as William Wells Brown and Charles Chesnutt slipped at times into notoriously ambiguous strategies of black characterization, it was black theatre that perhaps waged the most ambivalent uphill battle to rewrite white supremacist constructions of blackness.π Though the gutsy and original African Company had, in the 1820s, offered a critical paradigm for autonomous black theatre production and management, only in the late nineteenth century did the performance circuit fully blossom into a viable social, economic, and political terrain for black entertainers.∫ With the genealogical roots of minstrelsy as well as the coon song phenomenon spectacularly visible, post-Reconstruction black theatre weathered a taxing gestation period as it struggled to garner the support of African American critics and patrons and as it aimed to earn the respect of mainstream culture. Historically, the black press had given very little attention to black minstrel troupes surfacing at midcentury. Conversely, white minstrel performers responded ambivalently to the presence of professional competition.Ω On either side of the Jim Crow divide, however, minstrelsy remained the elephant in the room. White entertainers struggled with new ways to maintain a foothold in the business, while black performers confronted the harsh reality that this racially crude and malevolent form might serve as a gateway to new professional ventures. Inevitably, blackface minstrelsy evolved into a critical site for black musical theatre’s gradual innovative development and popularity by providing a necessary entrance for African Americans to cultivate employment as show business entertainers, playwrights, composers, and eventually producers.</p><p> The roots of these opportunities can be traced to the 1850s, a period of broad social, cultural, and political dissonance in transatlantic culture, andone in which the landscape of black performance underwent radical upheaval. While African American abolitionists crafted and reworked fugitive forms of cultural and political expression, this period also gave birth to organized African American minstrel troupes, the earliest of these northeastern "colored minstrels" dating back to 1855.≤≠ Following the Civil War, minstrelsy afforded black performers the room to move, socially, economically, and geographically. Put another way, blackface minstrelsy bequeathed African American cultural workers the critical tools to transport themselves literally across the country, to new economic heights, and imagistically out of the desert of blackface abjection. Wealth, mobility, and respect might eventually provide them with the "rare opportunity" to experiment with tidying up the detritus of stereotypes born out of blackface popular culture.≤ Yet the lingering irony in the postbellum period’s black minstrelsy phenomenon was that even in this profession black labor was largely managed, marketed, and (mis)handled by white entrepreneurs who disproportionately profited from their efforts, particularly by the time of the early 1870s, as Reconstruction began to wane in earnest.≤≤ As white minstrel entrepreneurs such as Callendar and Haverly continued to promote primitivist notions of black culture, African American minstrel productions were caught in a vortex of retrograde slavery images. These plantation productions eerily mirrored the erasure of Reconstruction’s black enfranchisement efforts even as they made visible a new kind of black (theatrical) labor class asserting its freedom and creating its own aesthetic and economic property.≤≥</p><p> In many ways, one could read the explosion of the "coon song" phenomenon in the late nineteenth century as an aesthetic instantiation of black social mobility even within the context of the "colored" minstrel show. At the height of their popularity in the 1890s and subsequent decades, coon songs were a distinctly crass and inglorious celebration of grotesque minstrel caricature compressed into syncopated black American folk music melodies. While the most popular numbers re-attached pornographic sloth, social recklessness, and gluttonous excess to blackface blackness, these songs were marked by their postbellum white-supremacist paranoia of Civil War amendments and black socioeconomic autonomy. Songs like "Coons on Parade" and "When a Nigger Makes a Hundred" greeted the aspirations of newly migrant African Americans in the North with a sour wink and a smile.≤∂ Yet the great irony of the coon song rage was that it too, like minstrel revues before it, became a source of bread and butter for the very individuals it mocked and scorned. As many black entertainers, songwriters, and burgeoning producers began to profit from creating and marketing xenophobic pop songs for a new age, theyparadoxically went about the business of nurturing and funding a newly moneyed class of artists intent on developing a black musical theatre of an entirely different order.≤∑</p><p> Out of this class came the creators of In Dahomey. Well-traveled, wellschooled, and well-skilled, their specific aim was to push African American performance in a new direction for a new century. Whether they could advance past the weight of burnt-cork end men and chicken and watermelon serenades was a question that some black critics publicly posed as the curtain went up on Williams and Walker’s grand and ambitious endeavors. It is a question that contemporary scholars continue to ask as they revisit the rocky terrain of Dahomey and other back-to-Africa musicals from the Gilded Age. Importantly, as critics continue to search for the "cracks in the public mask of the black man" that Sandra Richards locates in her pioneering work on Williams and Walker, we might also continue to refine our method of sussing out the provocative "cracks" in postbellum black performance. Were dissonant expressive strategies discernible to audiences and critics searching for signs of uplift then as well as now? If so, how do we recuperate and mark these moments when, to borrow a phrase from Malcolm X, (coon) singing turned into swinging?≤∏</p><p> The itinerancy of early black musical theatre’s entrepreneurs and performers had much to do with the form’s latent insurgency. As an increasing number of African Americans became immersed in the sweeping culture of migration at the turn of the century, the structure and content of black performance manifested and responded to the conditions of movement, resettlement, and dislocation. Foreshadowing the wily tricksters in George Schuyler’s 1930s satiric novel Black No More who benefit from "observation and contact" with the master (white) class, the pioneers of the Gilded Age’s black theatre circuit would gradually reformulate, stylize, and create a rupture in minstrel and coon song forms by way of a similar strategy.≤π Perhaps no turn-of-the-century black performer articulated an interest in observation and contact and thought and theorized more provocatively on the process of white performance and African American theatre craft than George Walker. In two high-profile articles published during the height of his company’s fame, Walker wrote at length about nascent black theatre strategies and detailed his dual commitment to black entertainment culture and racial uplift politics. In a brilliant and oft-cited 1906 Theatre Magazine article published three years after In Dahomey’s ambitious debut and five years before his untimely death, Walker outlined the bursts of inspiration and youthful creativity that led to the Williams and Walker partnership and the company’srisk-taking theatrical endeavors. Part autobiographical sketch, part editorial polemic, the article reads as much like an American migration narrative as it does a rumination on African American performance tactics and political intent. The detail that Walker assigns to his roots in Lawrence, Kansas, as a "lad" who latched onto colored minstrelsy and medicine shows proves helpful in tracing some of the cultural experiences that would no doubt influence his later work with Bert Williams. Walker incorporates rich detail in his description of "roughing it" all the way to California, encountering picaresque show business characters who mentored him in the art of observing white minstrel performers and who assisted him in stylizing his own craft. His comments create a lively record of black spectatorship and the evolution of African American turn-of-the-century theatre aesthetics.≤∫</p><p> Walker’s account of meeting "quack doctors doing business in the West" and his forthright assessment of racial politics in entertainment culture shape the structure of his narrative. Implicit in the article is the suggestion that moving around the country enabled him to engage in methods of observation and contact which ultimately informed the development of Williams and Walker’s successful craftsmanship. If, as Walker observes, "in those early days of the black man on the American stage," it remained hard to believe that African American men "would ever rise above being a mere minstrel man," the actor’s Theatre Magazine piece illuminates his fierce dedication and strategic commitment to reversing that trend through his work as a performer. Anticipating the shrewd, racialized business acumen of Schuyler’s protagonist Max Disher some thirty-three years later, Walker declares that his "experience with the quack doctors taught me two good lessons: that white people are always interested in what they call ‘darky’ singing and dancing; and the fact that I could entertain in that way as no white man could, made me valuable to the quack doctors." Walker suggests that this revelation led to his and Williams’s subsequent forays into the world of white performance culture. Amplifying the detective roles that they would inhabit in their Dahomey musical, the Williams and Walker of the 1906 Theatre Magazine piece troll the world of west coast theatre in a bid to document and evaluate the mechanics of white minstrelsy.≤Ω "When we were not working," Walker reports,</p><p> 216</p><p> we frequented the playhouses just the same. In those days black-faced white comedians were numerous and very popular. They billed themselves "coons." Bert and I watched the white "coons," and were often much amused at seeing white men with black cork on their faces trying to imitate black folk. Nothing about these white men’s actions was natural and there-</p><p> alien /nation</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> fore nothing was as interesting as if black performers had been dancing and singing their own songs in their own way.≥≠</p><p> Walker’s statement is a remarkable cultural document for several reasons. First, it makes visible the daily craftsmanship of the black actor and gives a strong and public voice to the figure of the black theatre spectator. Black performance emerges as craft and labor in this piece, and it demands an investment in time and preparation as the two actors commit themselves to visiting other venues and processing the skills of fellow actors. The most stunning detail of Walker’s narrative is his description of how he and Bert would "watc[h] the white ‘coons’ " with a mixture of amusement and seeming disregard as these performers floundered in what he reads as a hopeless effort to embody the "natural." It is a rich moment, and it is one that recalls the many undervalued instances of African Americans registering and evaluating what historian Mia Bay refers to as the "white image in the black mind."≥ Second, Walker’s anecdote of black performers encountering whites in blackface slyly reverses a key primal scene in minstrel history. If the lore of white entertainer T. D. Rice spying a disabled black man "jumping Jim Crow" and transforming that dance into the earliest of minstrel shows was legendary nineteenth-century knowledge, Walker’s tale of encountering bland and ineffectual white racial mimicry repeats the moment of observation and appropriation in order to reject the "counterfeit" act and to clear a space for bold, colorful, and, what he here calls, "natural" black performance.≥≤</p><p> Walker was a notorious stickler when it came to proclaiming and embracing the authenticity of African American performance practices, even as his comments, as well as the form and content of his subsequent theatrical work, suggest a more complicated approach to articulating racial identity formation. As Williams and Walker gained global notoriety, Walker seldom shied away from discussing and comparing white and black performance practices. He was indeed the savvy business partner half of the duo and exploited controversial topics as both an expression of forthright conviction and as a means to publicity, often playing with images of the black gaze, racial authenticity politics, and what he openly perceived as the fallacies of white mimicry. The aesthetic differentiation in segregated theatre culture particularly drew his ire. Again documenting his and Williams’s research of white and black performances in the black periodical The New York Age, Walker pointed out a disparity that "began to agitate [their] gray matter. . . . We noticed that colored men had to be . . . athletic comedians." Conversely, he observes that "the white man gets the desired results without perspiring." What made Walker perhapsmost ingenious is that he was able to channel his palpable discontent regarding the inequities of Jim Crow theatre practices into performances and publicity stunts that directly addressed questions of racial competition and appropriation. Challenging a white business tycoon to a well-orchestrated cakewalk duel in 1898 called attention to racial discordance in performance culture by way of a satiric cultural spectacle. For Walker, the quest to level the playing field between white and black performers remained an urgent concern, and he dedicated himself tirelessly to stretching the boundaries of what "colored" performers could and could not do on the stage. He seemed to care most about providing opportunities for black actors and rectifying the problem of white minstrels who "stood in the way of black actors, and thus he pledged "to do all [he] could to get what [he] felt belonged to us by the laws of nature."≥≥</p><p> George Walker was joined in his professional crusade by a cluster of key players who challenged the boundaries of the color barrier through resourcefully imaginative means. Called by some the "strongest theatrical combination" of the early twentieth century, the Williams and Walker Company served as a base for black performers and theatre workers to imagine and execute forms of expression which flagrantly transgressed the color line.≥∂ Through diligent and diverse methods of encountering and turning the gaze back onto white supremacist performance culture and by melding rigorous imitation with surreptitious bastardization, and bold parody into new forms, a group of impassioned young black performers in their twenties and thirties, from places like Kansas, California, and Washington, D.C., came together in New York City to collaborate and to create a fast-moving and unpredictable musical of enormous proportion. A mobile class of artists, their work seemed to mirror and manifest the politics of movement and dislocation. The son of a Bahamian immigrant family, Bert Williams moved, for instance, from the Caribbean to Florida and on to Riverside, California, before making the trek to northern California, where he had intended to enroll at Stanford University. His subsequent meeting with Walker in San Francisco led to the inception of their sixteen-year partnership. Celebrated for being a "master of gesture," Williams honed a dissonant method of performance that went, as Camille Forbes suggests, "against the discourse of minstrelsy" in order "to ascribe new meanings to his black body."≥∑</p><p> Likewise, in his intricate and wildly influential compositions for the most prominent and successful black theatre productions of the era, heavyweight composer Will Marion Cook created musical material that manifested his own unique Du Boisian "two-ness." As the heir to a prominent, "talented tenth" family who found his initial success in coon songs and colored musical revues,Cook waged a tortuous and complicated struggle to negotiate between an elite classical music training and the limited employment opportunities available to African American entertainers at the turn of the century. Cook’s remarkable pedigree which took him from Oberlin Conservatory to Berlin and on to New York City’s National Conservatory where he studied with Joseph Joachim and Antonin Dvorak resulted in his ability to draw from a potent elixir of European and African American forms in his "genius" compositional aesthetic. A composer who once advised a young Duke Ellington to find "logical ways" of making art and then avoid them and "let your inner self break through," Cook is often recognized for having executed a way to "mov[e] fluidly between black and white styles, drawing on the breadth of his training as a musician."≥∏ As the principal composer for In Dahomey, he brought a sharp, cosmopolitan musical aesthetic to the production which he daringly matched with unpredictable experimental flourishes in musical form.</p><p> A professional mentor figure to many of the players in the Williams and Walker Company, Cook presided over a group of inspired artists such as Jesse Shipp, who enjoyed a reputation for being an enormously successful stage manager in New York. Shipp was one of the key figures in the production team. A veteran of colored minstrel shows, he is credited with having written the bulk of the In Dahomey libretto and for helping to manage the production demands of the company’s domestic and U.K. tours. The grace and grand vision of these elegant and imaginative theatre men—from Williams and Walker to Cook, Shipp, and composer-lyricist Alex Rogers—were matched by the contributions of several trailblazing women who worked in and traveled with the In Dahomey company.≥π Singers Abbie Mitchell, Lottie Williams, and Hattie McIntosh drew critical attention for their roles in the musical, and the activist actress and choreographer Aida Overton Walker garnered praise from journalists and audiences that often rivaled that of the stars of the show. These women’s participation in the company reinforced the belief that theatre could serve as a particularly viable field of opportunity for African American women of the new century. Moreover, that three out of four of these women were married to principal members of the production team illuminates the extent to which the world of postbellum black musical theatre was populated by a unique class of African American heterosexual couples with similar professional, political, and social aspirations. In its vibrant professional couplings, the Williams and Walker Company to some extent mirrored the visions of postbellum black women’s club visionaries such as Pauline Hopkins and Frances Harper who, in their turn-of-the-century fiction, imagined and theorized the exigencies of lively and creative cross-gender partnership ascentral to racial uplift. Together these performers created and moved through colorful cultural spaces.≥∫</p><p> Although musical theatre "became one of the few avenues of black mobility in a white world," this socioeconomic movement coupled with the experience of social encounter afforded by black theatre’s appeal to black as well as white audiences established a strikingly dissonant situation. The great irony in performing a musical like In Dahomey which focused on black emigration, entrepreneurial pursuits, and class aspirations was that it presented these themes in the midst of a space where, as one critic remarked in 1903, "the color line ha[d] been drawn." And thus, for all its lavish images of high-stepping, globe-trotting, and social-climbing African Americans, In Dahomey’s Broadway debut at the opulent New York Theatre was nonetheless subject to the constrictive tyrannies of segregated seating plans. More than one thousand black patrons reportedly turned out for opening night on February 18, 1903, dressed to the nines, despite the fact that they were shuttled away to "the bleak and inhospitable gallery."≥Ω In spite of the sting of this insult, the musical event itself created a space where black patrons were able to imagine themselves moving through time and space, across land and nation, from costume to costume. At the very least, these black Manhattanites took the occasion of a night out at a Broadway theatre to adorn themselves in the kinds of elegant sartorial items—"evening gowns, tuxedos, and swallow tails, just the same as the ‘white 400’ " in the house. For these black patrons the event became another way to contest the boundaries of the color barrier, "crossing over" into the fabulous world of New York social life. In short, during an era in which the color line fortified itself in law and social spaces, black theatre performers took advantage of stretching their own as well as their audience’s movement and opportunities for social encounter. Through the musical form they claimed "a space for creative, joyous, and powerful body movement unencumbered" by blackface caricature.∂≠</p><p> For the African American women and men who worked in black musical theatre, the long-term goal was simple and clear: create black art by, for, and about black people. As pioneering songwriter and composer Bob Cole (one half of the period’s other dominant black theatre team Cole and Johnson) put it in his 1898 "Colored Actor’s Declaration of Independence," the aim of the colored musical companies was to write, manage, and produce their own shows. But to this manifesto Cole would add the important pledge to wage a war against the color barrier by insisting that there must be "[n]o divided houses—our races must be seated from the boxes back." Writing from the vantage point of the flourishing Harlem Renaissance, James Weldon Johnsondocumented the bustling activities of this distinct and lively group of black theatre actors and entrepreneurs who worked to fulfill the vision of Cole, Johnson, and others. The "new phase of life among coloured New Yorkers" and the swelling numbers of black migrants fresh from places like Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee delivered vital energy to the city. Midtown Manhattan’s Tenderloin area took root as the space where black actors, musicians, and managers began to congregate and create aesthetic as well as political coalitions. George Walker was a major organizer in this regard. In addition to his keen managerial skills, the actor was quick to establish a space, known as "the Williams and Walker flat," where black theatre artists congregated. He also played a key role in spearheading the creation of The Frogs, a landmark professional organization designed to promote and legitimize black theatre so that productions were not "lumped" by white audiences into "circus attractions."∂</p><p> This vibrant community of spirited collaborations and buoyant social gatherings yielded increasing triumph for New York’s black actors, musicians, and composers. The rousing rooftop success of 1898’s Clorindy, or the Origin of the Cakewalk served as a precursor to In Dahomey’s and evolved out of the connections made in the core group from "the Williams and Walker flat." A late-night summer entertainment atop the Casino Roof Garden, Clorindy took shape as a result of Cook’s compositions, arrangements, and his prescient collaboration with celebrity poet and Midwest transplant Paul Laurence Dunbar. While the two had initially met in Chicago, it was in the Tenderloin area that Cook and Dunbar wrote the music and lyrics for what became Clorindy.∂≤ The partnership was an infamously fraught one, despite the fact that Dunbar was, in every way, Cook’s lyrical counterpart. Like Cook, Dunbar famously wrestled with tensions between classical forms and vernacular expressiveness in his highly successful post-Reconstruction poetry; he too notoriously straddled an aesthetic divide as expansively complex as Cook’s music. Born in Dayton, Ohio, Dunbar moved around the Midwest, Northeast, and the United Kingdom and had made a name for himself as a poet capable of writing both crisp and elegant "odes" to Africa as well as salty, dialect-driven verses born out of the mythical mouths of "the folk." Eventually finding his way into the Williams and Walker circle of lively and prolific black Manhattan, Dunbar’s work with Cook would serve as an all-important precursor to In Dahomey.</p><p> That the two were able to make some sort of peace to work on In Dahomey seems miraculous considering Cook’s proclamation that he could not work again with Dunbar. Likewise Dunbar had registered a palpable horror onClorindy’s opening night when black people were "laughing at themselves" and "offering themselves as objects for the laughter of others." At the time, he vowed that "Clorindy would be his last coon show." But in spite of (or perhaps directly as a result of ) this conflict, a second fuller and remarkably ambitious production emerged. Perhaps this professional friction resulted in a "collaborative dissonance" (to borrow a phrase from Brent Edwards) which informs the quirky, off-center nature of Cook and Dunbar’s work in black musical theatre. At the very least, the conflicts that they weathered only added to each artist’s tortured efforts to reconcile mainstream success with aesthetic integrity. Cook waged a struggle to balance blackface composition with classical experimentation. Similarly, Dunbar was attempting to mediate his interest in eighteenth-century English comedies of manners and the financial necessity to write for minstrel shows.∂≥ At the heart of both Cook’s and Dunbar’s work was a quest to produce art that might speak to "the di≈cult question of progress after emancipation, the adjustments of reconstruction, the perils and the promise of migration to Northern cities, and the paradoxes of portraying ‘Negro’ life authentically while a residue of stereotype remained strong in society on the whole." In the midst of these myriad struggles and conflicts, these two brilliant men came together to make art that seemingly registered their di≈culty with each other as well as the alienating experience of black life in postbellum America.∂∂</p><p> Although undoubtedly heterogeneous in their multiple and diverse professional aspirations, the core creators of In Dahomey were united by a single passion to experiment with form and a dedication to advancing the field of black theatrical performance to new levels of innovation and imagination. Desiring to break new ground for black performers, George Walker envisioned a musical that might make what he called a dramatic "leap" forward in theatre. Critically, this goal meant working on a two-pronged front to both disrupt the minstrel form and to offer what Walker purportedly believed to be more "earnest" representations of black people. As he ominously recounted in Theatre Magazine, in the duo’s early years, "we saw that the colored performer would have to get away from the ragtime limitations of the ‘darky,’ and we decided to make the break, so as to save ourselves and others." Williams and Walker were intent on creating a rupture in the minstrel form and "making a radical departure from the old ‘darky’ style of singing and dancing" in order to think "along new lines."∂∑ They did so with a new musical that veered left of dominant racial authenticity politics at the turn of the century and that diverged in critical ways from previous African American expressive forms as well.Within this climate in which people like Williams, Walker, Dunbar, and Cook were actively experimenting with ways to break free of form and create new ones, In Dahomey took shape. In particular, Williams and Walker gained specific inspiration for creating the musical as a result of what Forbes might call the duo’s unique "bilateral racial" interaction in the late 1890s and early 1900s. These extraordinary encounters served as evidence of their own profound (and perhaps aesthetically fortuitous) sites of social and cultural dislocation, and they shaped and informed the duo’s sense of theatrical experimentation. To Walker, the experience of watching white men imitating black people presented a profound crisis for black performers who were rendered absent and unnecessary by the acts of "white coons." A double-negative of sorts, black performers like Walker and Williams stood in the shadows while the grotesque, mythical antiheroes of white minstrelsy created and assumed the roles of black figures in the cultural imaginary. For those black men and women who eventually entered the profession, Walker famously remarked that nothing "seemed more absurd than to see a colored man making himself ridiculous in order to portray himself."∂∏ For Walker, the sheer alienation in watching white men "blacking up" and black men doing the same served, in part, as a catalyst for him to create a space for what he called the "natural" black performer. But a chance encounter in San Francisco ultimately redirected the way that he and Williams articulated and grappled with "the natural" in black performance in significant ways.</p><p> Hired as last-minute "sham native Dahomians" at San Francisco’s Midwinter Fair in 1893, the duo were, as Walker describes, "brought into close touch with native Africans" who were incorporated into the large-scale imperial exhibition. The idea of two postbellum black performers being paid to perform the "part" of Africans who had yet to arrive from their native land was extraordinary enough as it is. But what made the incident all the more remarkable was George Walker’s enterprising resolve to create something entirely new out of the encounter. Indicative of the ideological struggle apparent in his Theatre Magazine article which oscillates between a capitulation to "the real" ("real coons" and the "laws of nature" in black performance) and a commitment to the aesthetically imagined, Walker came out of the Dahomian encounter with an interest in somehow attempting to straddle the boundaries between an "authentic" and a fanciful "blackness" in theatrical performance. "We were not long in deciding that," he claimed in hindsight, "if we ever reached the point of having a show of our own, we would delineate and feature native African characters as far as we could, and still remain American, and make our acting interesting and entertaining to American audiences."∂πWalker’s comments make plain the pair’s interest in producing multivocal black cultural expressiveness. But his comments also reflected something richly anticipatory of what Bertolt Brecht later envisioned as a kind of theatrical alienation. Inasmuch as Walker’s actor attempts to remain the actor while "showing" the (African) character for the audience in question, he engages in a method that prefigured Brecht’s twentieth-century efforts to create a theatre in which the "performer’s self-observation, artful and artistic act of selfalienation" prevents "the spectator from losing himself in the character completely."∂∫ From this standpoint, we might call Walker’s ambitious efforts to perform the hyphenated self a kind of Afro-diasporic alienation effect. While the ethnographic impulse in Walker’s statement is undeniable, and his aim to display "the native" plainly borrows the language of exhibition culture of the period, his comments also reveal an impulse to imagine a space where black performers might straddle the dually elusive (illusive as well as allusive) spheres of "African" and "American" identity. Walker and Williams were thus deeply immersed in questioning how and in what ways to articulate the dissonant multivocality of black identity in performance space.</p><p> Not surprisingly, Walker would claim with certainty and pride that "we were the first to introduce the Americanized African songs," numbers such as "My Zulu Babe," "My Castle on the Nile," and "My Dahomian Queen" in In Dahomey. The actor was intrigued with ways of performing the condition of (re)imagining "Africa" through African American eyes. Born in the interstices of Walker and Williams’s detective-like observations about white coons and Dahomians in the city by the bay and placed in an imperial pop cultural universe clambering for exhibitions of "the real" and "the native," In Dahomey arrived on the transatlantic musical scene. Williams and Walker’s production conjured up a new paradigm for black performance that mixed, scrambled, and churned back out disruptive images of burnt-cork bodies and displaced "natives" in order to express the distinct experience of African American alienation at the turn of the century. The duo and their company created a rupture in the inherited forms of black representation in order to re-envision social and cultural survival, and they sought to reclaim "blackness" as a kind of property invested with wealth and induced with real social and cultural power for African Americans.</p><p> In Dahomey first opened in Stamford, Connecticut, on September 8, 1902, against a backdrop of increasing U.S. imperialism and in the midst of an evolving transatlantic popular culture invested in the display of indigenous peoples. It was a period in which U.S. expansionist efforts were in fact commensurate with the disfranchisement of U.S. people of color.∂Ω Imperial ex-hibits like "Darkest Africa" in the United States and the "Dahomeyan Village" displays in both the States and the U.K. additionally marketed black primitivist paradigms for public consumption and sustained an oddly tense juxtaposition with turn-of-the-century black theatre.∑≠ Strangely and disquietingly heterogeneous, In Dahomey inserted itself in this volatile cultural fabric of ethnological spectacles and scientific exhibits by offering a vertiginous combination of forms and images. While it featured much of the structure that became standard in early black musicals—an overture, chorus, some improvisation, featured singers, specialty entertainers, company song and dance numbers, humor scenarios, and magnificent displays—the musical nevertheless represented a break, not only from plantation minstrel shows featuring black performers but also from earlier African American show business productions. Mixing multiple forms, the show borrowed liberally from the spectacular unpredictability and visual impressiveness of the extravaganza form in its utilization of a large cast, lavish costumes, and a fast-moving plot like that of the 1890s colored minstrel variety productions like The Creole Burlesque Show. The show also bore some resemblance to midcentury burlesque productions like 1869’s Robinson Crusoe. At the same time, however, critics have argued that it is In Dahomey’s Will Cook–engineered musical composition which "consistently transcends the expressive straitjacket that the prevailing coon song style imposed on black artistry in the realm of popular music and theatre." With an impressive array of solos, chorus compositions, and instrumental dance numbers woven into the production, In Dahomey manifested a trailblazing cultural and generic diversity.∑</p><p> What made the production such a formidable endeavor was its amorphousness, its ability to stretch and change forms as it progressed and evolved over 1,100 performances from 1902 to 1905. At the core of this fluctuating program was the fluid and frequent use of interpolations. Musical theatre historian Thomas Riis has done much to demonstrate the extent to which In Dahomey was the product of many different voices and visions, in part because it featured a multiplicity of songs that were mixed, matched, and interchanged across multiple and distinct productions mounted in New York, London, and Boston. Although the element of change is certainly nothing new to the culture of turn-of-the-century dramaturgy, this kind of moving workshop of tooling and retooling the show was critically important to black performers. In Dahomey was a place where African American cultural producers improvised themselves into consciousness. Just as the production "was simultaneously one thing and many things, a story told in dialogue, song, and action, yet never quite the same on successive nights," so too did it reflect the"changing same" of black identity formation. Indeed, the shifting form of the show became the fulcrum of the black identity paradigms that In Dahomey brought to life onstage every night.∑≤</p><p> The remainder of this chapter, then, reads In Dahomey as a site of shifting textual possibility for black performers in this new era of possibility. The chapter focuses most fully on the initial version of the script published in the United States in 1902 in order to explore the provocative disjointedness and the fecund ruptures embedded in that very text and in subsequent performances of the script. Taking the prevalent theme of terrible transmutation in coon songs as a point of departure, In Dahomey appropriated the concept of transformation in its very form.∑≥ By aggressively mixing and matching genres and material, it created something indeed new and, at times, ba∆ing to even the likes of Sylvester Russell. But it would also, as black journalist R. C. Murray observed in hindsight of the musical’s globetrotting success, come to encapsulate a "history of the progress of this heterogeneous, yet indivisible people" at the dawn of a new century.</p><p> Nappy Edges</p><p> Can the Ethiopian change his skin? the leopard change his spots? —George Moore, Impressions and Opinions</p><p> An "irresistibly protean" work in progress, In Dahomey’s plot underwent frequent revisions as the production traveled from the Northwest and on to the U.K. before returning to the States in 1904.∑∂ Yet across two continents and over a thousand performances, the musical’s skeletal narrative remained essentially the same: finding themselves embroiled in an odd quest to return a family heirloom to its proper owner, the transient dandy Rareback Pinkerton (Walker) and his socially inept sidekick Shylock Homestead (Williams) embark on a journey which takes them from Boston to Florida and the home of Cicero Lightfoot, the "President of a Colonization Society," and finally to the West African region of Caboceer in Dahomey, where the two protagonists, accompanied by a large and motley entourage, choose to relocate in order to build a "broadway in the jungle."∑∑ During their travels, Rareback and Shylock encounter a diverse assortment of characters who are, like them, obsessed with social climbing. They run the gamut from Lightfoot’s glamorous bourgeois daughter (Aida Overton Walker) who longs for the pleasures of the social aristocracy to a smooth-talking urban hustler intent on reaping the benefits of black colonization in Africa.</p><p> Concerned with the politics of place, (re)settlement, and African American </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> (dis)placement, In Dahomey’s first act slyly pronounces these themes by commencing its action in front of an "Intelligence O≈ce" located in downtown Boston, circa 1902. With the theme of espionage hovering provocatively in the backdrop, the curious setting invites audiences to enter into a world of subterfuge and duplicity. Most critics of In Dahomey have overlooked this seemingly small detail of place in the musical’s opening scene in favor of focusing on the larger implications of transnationalism embedded in the plot. Yet the presence of this mysterious "o≈ce" would prove thematically resonant in the context of the production. From the minor role of George Reeder (reader), the figure who runs the Intelligence O≈ce, to the more pronounced activities of the would-be detectives Pinkerton and Shylock, In Dahomey is fundamentally a work that articulates the ways that postbellum African Americans were constantly sleuthing for answers to their own condition. As private eyes hired to retrieve Cicero Lightfoot’s prized silver casket, Williams and Walker’s turns as "Rare and Shy" might, on the one hand, seem to merely provide a convenient vehicle for the two entertainers to engage in what the script directions often richly refer to as "business," carefully inspired physical and verbal improvisation (id1, 69). But the detective figure may serve as another indicator of just how oppositionally situated the musical imagined itself to be. After all, as the Sherlockian Shylock remarks toward the end of act 1, "What’s the use of being a detective if you can’t ask questions"? (id1, 72).∑∏</p><p> The questions and concerns the musical repeatedly asked were often housed in the figures of its seemingly innocuous detectives. In George Walker’s lengthy monologue from act 2, scene 2, for instance, Rareback recounts and reanimates the adventures of the dime-novel detective hero Nick Carter for his partner. His tour-de-force performance allowed for the comedian to turn on his "electric smile" and to make use of "wild gestures" and "long words" in the middle of the production in what is often read as a scene which merely enabled the performing veteran to showcase his abilities (id1, 76–78). But the riddle of Rare’s spirited narration of "Old Sleuths" and robbers on the run perhaps has a resounding answer in the figure of Bert Williams’s "Jonah Man," his signature song that he often inserted at the end of the Nick Carter narrative. While "Jonah Man" would become a Bert Williams classic upon its interpolation into In Dahomey, its particular placement within the musical complicates the stock figure of the detective in the narrative. As Forbes contends, Williams’s Jonah Man figure "deepened the usually simplistic ‘darky’ character. . . . Not merely miserable, or unlucky, the unfortunate Jonah Man. . . . Communicated the experience of the wretched."∑π A kind of call-and-response sequence rendered in comedy and song, Walker’s Rareback comes to life in the form of a "first-class detective" figure who, in his entertaining tale, apprehends thieves and saves the day, while Williams’s Jonah Man emerges as an existential response of sorts. Ever seeking a place to "homestead," Shylock can only sing the blues about his "hard luck" and his "old, old tale" of falling down a "coal hole" (id1, 85). Together this oblique juxtaposition of lively detective work and lost men gives greater metaphorical meaning to the role of the detectives in In Dahomey. In short, Shylock’s shiftlessness is a contrast and a problem that Rareback will try to rectify by encouraging him to seize on fulfilling employment as a detective—or at least to get rich and climb the social ladder as he intends to do. As a team, Rareback and Shylock sleuth toward the promise of African American identity remade and resurrected somewhere along the journey to Dahomey.</p><p> That journey toward revision and reinvention begins, however, long before Rare and Shy make their comic entrance in act 1. Outside Boston’s O≈ce of Intelligence, the musical commences its adventure with a gaggle of nameless characters seduced by the promise of corporeal convertibility. Gathering together in the street, they listen to the noisy pitch of the boisterous "Dr. Straight," a figure who, the program’s cast of characters relates, is "straight" in "name only" but is, in fact, a "street fakir" tra≈cking in fraudulence. Above the orchestrated din of Tambo and Bones, two joke-cracking end men (id1, 66), relics of the minstrel tradition which this all-black company will, through the course of this production, attempt to disassemble, the (dis)honorable Dr. Straight makes his opening appeal to a curious throng of onlookers and attempts to peddle an oddly concocted product with shockingly potent powers. To his entranced audience, Straight unveils a mysterious potion "made from roots, herbs, barks, leaf grasses, cereals, vegetables, fruits and chemicals warranted by myself, to do all that I claim, even more" (id1, 66).</p><p> With his penchant for malapropisms and mangled monologue, Straight would seem to serve no greater purpose in the production than to provide additional continuity with the minstrel show tradition. But Straight’s ideological and symbolic agency exceeds the limitations of minstrelsy in critical ways. A flamboyant charlatan, Straight is visibly linked to a genealogy of blackface performance culture. A popular figure from the medicine show circuit, he embodies the theatrical traditions on which cast members like George Walker initially cut their show business teeth. He also operates as the transitional bridge for cast and characters alike between postbellum black cultural performance and theatre proper. Most importantly, Straight opens the musical with a radical proposition that speaks to the fundamental hopes and desires of each of In Dahomey’s curious combination of desiring, oddballcharacters. He claims that his potion can transform "any dark skin son or daughter of the genius Africanus" into "an Apollo or Cleopatra with a hirsute appendage worthy of a Greek goddess" (id1, 66). With an arsenal of "natural ingredients" by his side, Straight here plays with the boundaries of racial categories. Right before the audience’s very eyes, Straight shrewdly flaunts the possibility that this organic product might ultimately "denaturalize" racial physiognomy for all who dare to use it. More than the sum of the fraud which his name belies, Straight’s project is one which pivots on a process (pun intended) of literally transforming and transfiguring corporeal blackness into a sign of canonical, European-fetishized "beauty" marks.∑∫</p><p> But this potion changes more than skin tone. As Straight proclaims, "this compound known as Straightaline is the greatest hair tonic on earth." It has the power to "make hair grow on bald-headed babies. It makes curly hair as straight as a stick in from one to ten days. Straightaline straightens kinky hair in from ten to thirty days and most wonderful of all, Straightaline straightens knappy or knotty hair" (id1, 67). Straight peddles a potion which cuts to the heart of black representational politics by addressing the racial signification of hair itself. As Kobena Mercer has argued, "black people’s hair" has "been historically devalued as the most visible stigmata of blackness, second only to skin." For this reason, he adds, "where race is a constitutive element of social structure and social division, hair remains powerfully charged with symbolic currency."∑Ω In this remarkable opening scene In Dahomey confronts the loaded semiotics of race and hair with sharply coded language and disorienting imagery. Disassembling and restructuring (racial) body parts on the medicine show market, the scene confronts and renders chaotic Jim Crow systems of logic which sought to discipline black "dress, walk [and] comport[ment]" in the postbellum era. In a moment which forecasts the fundamental social and political insurgency of the musical, all hell breaks loose in Dr. Straight’s funhouse of racial cosmetology where the conventions of the "white coon" minstrel shows are shown to the door.∏≠</p><p> Gradually and methodically, the "stigmata" of hair as well as skin in this scene are turned topsy-turvy, for Straight’s product turns out to be an elaborate linguistic and metaphorical pun. As the crowd slowly works itself into a frenzy over the Straightaline sale, the doctor presents yet another product to bolster his claims which he refers to simply as "Oblicuticus." The " ‘Obli,’ " he explains, "in this case, being an abbreviation of the word ‘obliterate.’ ‘Cuti’— taken from the word ‘cuticle,’ the outer skin, and ‘cuss’ is what everybody does when the desired results are not obtained, but there is no such thing as ‘fail’ " (id1, 67). A disturbing concept indeed, this attempt to "obliterate" blacknessrests on a teasingly disruptive premise, however, since it suggests that even the biologically fixed topography of skin can be converted into a terrain of artifice, a point of trickery. Straight describes how "this wonderful face bleach removes the outer skin and leaves in its place a peachlike complexion that can’t be duplicated—even by peaches. Changing black to white and vice versa." What is striking about Straight’s pitch is the way that his language insists upon the oddly "un-real" quality of this skin-lightening transfiguration. Rather than endorsing an oversimplified mimesis of whiteness, Straight promises his customers that Oblicuticus will yield a "peachlike" complexion which remains weirdly incomparable—even in relation to the thing which it ostensibly mimics. Rather perversely at this moment, instead of becoming "white," the Oblicuticus consumer becomes something beyond or strangely outside of—perhaps even signifying on—whiteness. He or she embraces an "ambivalence of meaning" in his or her representational politics, challenging rather than delimiting the parameters of identity.∏ The power of Straight’s product, then, lies in its ability to disturb and undo ontological categories presumably linked to "race."</p><p> Straight’s appeal comes to a close with a spectacular physical manifestation of racial ambivalence. Pulling forth an attendant who the stage directions describe as "made up to be half white and half black" (id1, 67), the doctor assures, "Straightaline and Oblicuticus are the most wonderful discovery of modern times. This young man is a martyr to science. Here you have the work of nature. Here the work of art. Here is the kinky hair, here the bronze of nature, here the peachlike complexion" (id1, 67). Plucked from the crowd to model the wonders of science, this patchwork racial Frankenstein registers a mockery of contemporaneous scientific theories bent on erecting biological borders around racial identities. The exhibition of this racial amalgam blatantly foils the "ambitious schemes" which proliferated in the post-Darwinian era and which focused on "the futile search for criteria to define and describe race differences." For clearly his bronze and peach body of wonder attests to the complexities in asserting the politics of racial difference.∏≤ Straight’s comments playfully scramble racial paradigms, matching "kinky" black hair with "nature" and white skin pigmentation with "art." In this regard, his speech generates a trenchant critique of whiteness and its conflation with social and cultural normativity. Although Straight’s monologue, on the one hand, panders to popular stereotypes asserting the primitive "nature" of blackness, his words also level a subtle critique of the "white" side of this perambulatory scientific experiment. Classifying the body in question not as "art" but as "artifice," oddly outside the "real," "peachier" than a peach in its complexion,the scene jarringly places whiteness under construction for a captive set of onlookers. In a surprising break from late-nineteenth-century black class mobility politics, which often tra≈cked in concepts of physical as well as cultural assimilation, the Dr. Straight scene delivers the first of In Dahomey’s many iconoclastic scenarios.∏≥</p><p> For a production, then, that is so often catalogued as being, at best, the innocuous entertainment vehicle of a fledgling black actors troupe, and at worst the manifestation and promulgation of unbridled self-hatred in the black community, In Dahomey’s bold and clever transformation scenes are particularly offbeat and surprising. This version reinforces the extent to which the musical engaged in adapting and transforming racial paradigms to spectacular ends. Dr. Straight’s extended appeal not only celebrates the power of artifice and corporeal reinvention but his staged medicine show-turned-metaperformance translates and transfigures the Victorian pantomime scene. Straight’s act effectively turns the Benevolent Agent character of the classic phantasmagoric sequence, the central figure who activates a set of imaginative transformations, into a trickster character invested in marketing hair and skin products that heighten racial aesthetic masquerade. If, in fact, as historian Immanuel Geiss suggests, emigrationist movements directed toward resettling in Africa were fundamentally fueled by a racist American society which "at every turn reminded" black Americans of their "non-normative" physical features, then these scenes from In Dahomey turned that psychological terrorism on its head. The production revised the classic site of phenotypical colonization and abjection—that of skin color and hair texture—into a source of fluid and parodic play.∏∂ Thus, moving the closing pantomime scene to its eventual anterior positioning only seemed to strengthen and reinforce the spectacularly coded representational power of the opening act proper. This series of visually stunning scenes virtually lays the production’s politics of trickery bare before its audience.</p><p> The metaphorical and illusory play of In Dahomey’s prologue and opening act should not be overlooked, especially given the ethnological expectations and desires placed on black performers in nineteenth-century theatre culture. Despite the fact that one American critic claimed that, "ethnology on the stage is not of itself very exhilarating" (htc), nineteenth-century polygenetic discourse would prove itself to be a thick and myopic lens through which many (white) critics read the production and its African American cast members. Ethnology’s classic definition, that it is "the science which treats of races and peoples, and of their relations to one another, their distinctive physical and other characteristics," paradoxically fixates on racial difference through acomparative analysis and anxiety of sameness, of what’s "in relation" to what, how the geography of one’s own bodily cartography gets mapped out differently across the face of (an)other. Although as a number of social historians and cultural critics have noted, the "science of racial difference" was well beyond its peak by the early twentieth century, the desire to perfect some scholarly, physiological system of marking, categorizing, and ultimately "knowing" race deviation only seemed to intensify in a new, post-Darwinian era. Importantly, as David Krasner asserts, theatre served as a central cultural venue to deploy an ethnological discourse grounded in the politics of racial "authenticity" at the turn of the century. He reminds us that "the newly derived modernism promoted the idea of ‘authentic’ African Americans on stage as opposed to white minstrel imitations in blackface. Unfortunately, the image was based on racist presumptions that utilized newly formed ‘scientific’ data in manufacturing distortions" (Krasner, Resistance, 35).∏∑</p><p> Critic after critic in both England and North America gravitated toward a fascination and a simultaneous frustration with cataloguing physical and racial typology in the musical, all the while gleefully pursuing the show’s spectacle of difference for their readers. While there were many, especially in the United Kingdom, who were overwhelmingly receptive to the production, several critics could not surmount the racial anomaly that was In Dahomey. One New York writer presented an exhaustive catalogue of variations of skin pigmentation in cast members, wryly remarking that "local color abounded" on the Broadway stage. Others expressed a resistance to comprehending anything beyond the physical spectacle of racial difference in the theatre, insisting that there was a certain "di≈culty of understanding the speech . . . the eye [had] grown accustomed to the sable coloring of their faces."∏∏ The London Times theatre critic revealed himself to be nothing short of nonplused in his review of In Dahomey’s U.K. debut, for the production seemingly posed a linguistic obstacle in terms of how to articulate difference. The British journalist is inevitably reduced to expressing his bewilderment at the "so curiously disquieting" elements of the production which left the "resultant impression of . . . strangeness, the strangeness of the ‘coloured’ race [which] blended with the strangeness of certain American things." Although this particular critic assures his readers that this trope of deviance is an exotic and beloved quality to be treasured in art, the article sustains an excess of concern with the disruptively alien elements of the musical—referring to its "strangeness" no less than fifteen times throughout the course of the review (htc). Repetition here exposes a crisis in language regarding this "new aesthetic ‘thrill"’ of difference on the stage. To its befuddled audiences, something had run amuckin In Dahomey, and this critic, like several others, struggled to find the words to explain the crisis at hand.</p><p> Confronting the alien and the brave new world of black musicals, critics of the production often returned to safe and familiar racial tropes in their reviews. Like the imperial scientist who employs systems of collection and taxonomy as a means to establishing notions of order and stability onto previously "chaotic" and "unknowable" foreign subjects, journalists who reviewed In Dahomey projected totalizing scripts of racial deviancy onto its performers.∏π For the London Times critic, the solution was to dehistoricize and empty out these black figures on the stage, transforming them into comforting ciphers of blackface deviance. In this way, the Times critic can cling to a reading of In Dahomey’s black performers as functioning exclusively in the realm of the physically aberrant, of the "merely ugly . . . and strange." He assures that the "difference of colour will tell. We may be wrong, but these people seem to us, in their timid, half-averted gaze, to be mutely pleading for toleration; ‘mislike us not for our complexion,’ they seem to say. The spectacle is just a little painful—painful and strange" (htc). His proclamation that color itself "will tell," indeed narrate, the course of the production suggests the extent to which white audiences and critics would look to race as the guiding trope of In Dahomey, transcending plot and obfuscating the performative execution of cast members.</p><p> Forward leaning in content and form, In Dahomey created its own "alienating" effects, making "the incidents represented" on the stage each night appear indeed quite "strange to the public." Increasingly, the musical created an obstacle for those who diligently struggled to locate and categorize black figures who refused and fled from the pathologizing systems of minstrel theatre. Aching to recuperate what has apparently been lost, these writers left Dahomey longing to relocate the recognizable and "signified black" from bygone theatrical and musical fantasies. As the Williams and Walker Company steadily and persistently bucked tradition in its directorial choices to, for instance, cast black performers of varying shapes, hues, and sizes, critics publicly reacted to the startling heterogeneity of non-blackface blackness unfolding. Such was the case in a review of the 1907 Williams and Walker production Bandanna Land as one critic wondered, "What is the management’s object in permitting most of the men and nearly all of the women to wear straight hair is, however, di≈cult to understand. The types would be very close to natural if it were not for this hair. But it really does not matter, and the singing of the straight haired chorus is just as vigorous as it would be with kinks" (brt).∏∫ Lurking beneath the surface of this statement is a concern that this physicaldifference might aggravate the prescribed behaviorial role associated with race. At the base of his comments is the potent desire to naturalize blackness, to will these figures to at least perform a certain notion of race even if their physical "kinks" have all but disappeared. One British critic complained in his review of In Dahomey that "the fact that Bert Williams blacked-up confused matters" because it "made his darkness visible." This comment reflects the widespread di≈culty white spectators had when confronting race and racial artifice on the stage. Like Henry Box Brown and Adah Isaacs Menken before him, Bert Williams disoriented and disturbed the expectations of audiences who were surprised to find that he was "not so black as he is painted."∏Ω</p><p> No wonder, then, that so many critics went to such extraordinary lengths to champion the putative "essence" of blackness in theatre. For these opening sequences of In Dahomey enacted the mutability of phenotypical characteristics which were so necessary to sustaining dominant ideologies of racial inferiority. In their perceptions of black musical theatre, white critics and audiences alike often clung to an agenda that willfully assigned regressive, caricatured meanings to black performers. Even in Great Britain, a one-time shelter for black expatriates where, by the turn of the century, a black presence had dwindled and where racial tension began to rear its own uniquely British head, audiences came to expect and depend on narrow racial performances.π≠ The legendary lore of the cakewalk, for instance, became a necessary addition to In Dahomey since British audiences expected black Americans to perform the dance (Green, "In Dahomey," 23). This "dancing," some observed, "seems the natural expression of a racial instinct, not the laboriously acquired art of the schools" (htc). To be sure, the effort in these comments is twofold: to reduce the performative labor of In Dahomey’s cast down to essentialized luck (as it were), and to render the production artless and free of performative complexity. If anything, white critics repeatedly voiced a hunger for authenticity, for "real negro music," unadulterated and uncomplicated in scope and range (Green, "In Dahomey," 27). To stray from such an expectation resulted in the scathing or even the utterly bewildered review. Several British journalists expressed a deep disappointment with the In Dahomey production, declaring that "it is a pity, because it gives us the negro who has assimilated what is worst in European civilization instead of the negro at his best, in close and sympathetic touch with nature" (htc). The lament is a predictable one, in that it oscillates between a familiar "sense of disorientation and loss" and "an obsessive urge to discover an ‘authentic’ " black body in the wilderness of theatre culture.π</p><p> Despite this adoration of "the negro" in touch with his "natural" side,critical praise was often lavished on Bert Williams and George Walker for their ability to engage in an adept kind of bodily technology which ultimately deployed and reified popular notions of "blackness." This sort of paradoxical gesture is most evident in an elaborate pictorial spread on the performing duo that appeared in the pages of Vanity Fair during the second-leg of their American In Dahomey tour. The headline of the spread reveals the contradictions undergirding turn-of-the-century black minstrelsy and (white) racial fetishization: "Williams and Walker, nature’s black-face comedians in a series of specially posed facial stunts." A total of sixteen photographs arranged in a rectangular sequence and featuring a series of close-ups, profiles, and poses of each actor in a range of costumes border the two-page article. The concatenate structure of the layout creates a panoramic spread; its photographs fall into a sequential, almost phantasmagoric pattern of development wherein each performer’s facial contortions run the gamut of emotions from vaudevillian clownishness to tragic pathos. George Walker shifts from the extremity of a twisted scowl in one shot to a euphoric, wide-eyed, joyous smile with mouth agape in the next (brt).</p><p> The text that accompanies this montage a≈rms that "colored actors have frequently failed because they aimed higher than the white theatregoing public wanted to look, or because they set too low a mark for their efforts." Implicit in the article’s praise of the performing duo is a positive reception to their ability to revel in "nature" in such a way which might "gras[p] the secret way to attract white patronage." Yet the same article expresses a fascination and admiration for the "peculiar style of dramatic humor"—indeed, seemingly the graceful skill—of the "specially posed facial stunts." Although Williams and Walker engage in the "natural," the article celebrates the "novel" quality of their "posed" "stunts," their staged acts. Even the two middle photos of Bert Williams applying his burnt-cork make-up in his dressing room reinforce the striking juxtaposition between the white press’s fascination with essentialist racial categories and the constructedness of such roles. At the heart of this spread is a deep-seated interest in spectacularizing the corporeality of these performers. Nestled between two close-up shots of George Walker in his famous "dandy" top-hat attire, for instance, rests a shot of the entertainer standing shirtless with his back to the camera, arms slightly bent and suspenders loosely falling around his hips. It is the only photograph in the article which features a full standing shot of either performer’s torso; stripped and nearly faceless, save for the hint of Walker’s profile, his body intervenes in the portraits of facial masquerades as if to suggest that the faceless spectacle of the 18.

Given this type of preconceived scripting, it’s little wonder that a disproportionate number of critics in England and North America were steadfast in their insistence on the plotlessness of In Dahomey, for the production consistently deviated from reductive, oversimplistic representations of the black body. One British critic assured readers that, in regard to the plot, "what it is about we are unable, even with the assistance of a printed ‘argument,’ to fully understand" (Green, "In Dahomey," 24). The London Times critic contended even more aggressively that the production was an "example of plotless drama . . . perhaps without a rival" (htc). Most forcefully, however, one English critic proclaimed that "here was the coon in music, naked and unashamed, merry, pathetic, eager, and alive with emotion," urging the spectator finally to "forget purpose, plot, reason, and coherence, simply look and listen" (Green, "In Dahomey," 33).π≤ The frustration with plot was, in actuality, frustration with In Dahomey’s departure from conventional minstrelsy plot machination, resulting in an insistence on the critic’s part to dehistoricize and simplify the narrative by rendering it as "plotless," and by asserting that the production "was written without any other object than to amuse." For, in the end (quite literally), despite chiasmic scene revisions and negations, In Dahomey continuously refuted prescripted racial roles and what Marianna Torgovnick calls "the secret" of the "primitive" in the twentieth century, that "the primitive can be—has been, will be . . . whatever Euro-Americans want it to be." The musical proved time and again to be a production invested in transgressing the borders of the color line as it a≈rmed the inauthenticity of "color" categorization itself. Repeatedly, In Dahomey whispered its own secret—that the Ethiopian could, indeed, change his own skin.π≥</p><p> Alien Nation</p><p> We are not so sure a second visit to it</p><p> is to be recommended to anybody with nerves. —In Dahomey review, London, 1903</p><p> On April 28, 1903, five hundred people "from white and colored society" turned out in the grand salon of a New York City ocean liner to fete the Williams and Walker Company as it made its glamorous exit from the North American theatre world. On that night, America’s most successful black the-atre company threw a swank party and prepared to set sail for England. Initially booked for a six-week run at London’s Shaftesbury Theatre, the troupe was already strategizing ways to adapt their act to the fickle tastes and demands of British audiences weaned on their own beloved forms of blackface minstrelsy. The constraints of English audience expectations were not unforeseen by Bert Williams, who described in great detail the troupe’s preparations for their performance: "We did all our work without dialect. Once or twice I turned loose . . . little broad ‘coon’ talk on them, but they couldn’t understand." He adds that the troupe decided not to "depend too much on our ‘acting’ and none on our dialect."π∂ Williams and his cohorts knew full well that in the shadow of minstrelsy’s long arm their bodies meant more on the stage than their words to English audiences who privileged the racially spectacular corporeal. The cast gambled that an emphasis on mute black figures would offer an attractive accessibility to the musical which performative verbosity somehow curtailed.</p><p> Yet as it turned out, the eccentricities of In Dahomey’s racial body politic did little to placate critics who debated the show’s ability to "attract," "amaze," "distract," and "disturb." Called by one journalist confoundingly "untranslatable," In Dahomey’s spectacle of "garrulous" colored performers embroiled in intricate plots and intrigue proved too much for some (brt). Even the show’s staunchest U.K. supporters overlooked or disregarded the play’s narrative possibilities, choosing instead to pay homage to the frivolity of black entertainment in novel settings. This problem was not lost on Sylvester Russell who, in keeping with his outspoken style of journalism, chastised the "white critics, likes James Montague, who like to give a colored show a ‘jolly’ instead of good advice in criticism."π∑ Russell’s indictment exposes the level at which, in past and present critical circles, the black musical’s plot and textual complexity languished as an undertheorized work of drama. A closer examination of In Dahomey reveals, however, that the musical’s narrative manifests some of the text’s most potent and coded subversions. Rather than re-asserting the domination of (white) spectatorial desire, the musical’s unique plot devices combined with its spectacular construction of the black body waged a unique battle against the circumscription of black corporeality as well as narrativity. The key to the musical’s revisionist plot rested on its unpredictable engagement with contemporaneous black nationalist ideological concerns, and the production’s emphasis on the politics of capitalistic land ownership, (e)migration, and the creation of nationhood yoke together in unconventional ways to masterfully reformulate visions of Pan-Africanist cultural and political ideology.Despite the lingering and often pejorative characterization of their careers as "blacks-in-blackface" entertainers, Bert Williams and George Walker developed a number of early-twentieth-century theatrical projects that were informed by contemporaneous black nationalist political platforms. In a famous post-performance interview following a production of Bandanna Land, for instance, George Walker articulated a decidedly militant viewpoint regarding the role of black theatre and further asserted a theory of race pride which added additional meaning to In Dahomey’s appearance-obsessed opening scene. Walker boldly claimed that "you can’t get the best out of a boy by telling him that his hair should be straight instead of kinky, that his nose should be classic instead of flat. Nor can you expect a colored girl to realize the best there is in her if you make her believe that a black skin cannot be beautiful" (brt). Walker followed up this hearty embrace of "black beauty" with a fervent endorsement of black theatre as a means to communal rejuvenation and economic autonomy, gushing that his "greatest ambition . . . is to get money enough together to build a theatre—if possible to build one in New York, one in Philadelphia" (brt).π∏ Walker was a visionary in his belief that African American entertainers should have access to owning their performances. He and his cohorts used In Dahomey as a platform to enact and interrogate the possibility of black economic autonomy in a transnationalist context.</p><p> Theories of fiscal empowerment and capitalist aspirations abound, albeit in odd shapes and forms, in In Dahomey. Faithful servant and manumitted slave Cicero Lightfoot has, for instance, fortuitously inherited his former master’s Florida plantation at the musical’s opening, and his vicissitudes have subsequently thrown the Lightfoot family into an extended state of reveling in their new bourgeois roles. Daughter Rosetta pledges herself to becoming the "leader of the colored aristocracy," singing that "all I need is lots of dough, for that regulates the social scale, you know" (id1, 80). The majority of In Dahomey’s characters, in fact, commence a fevered quest for economic transformation. Upon meeting Pinkerton and Homestead, the mysterious "Hustling Charlie" explains that he is "goin’ to join this Colonization Society, blow over to Africa with them and get the money" which the continent has to offer (id1, 71). Even the newfound landowner Cicero desires additional prosperity and social mobility for his youngest daughter, Pansy, whom he instructs in the song "Society" not to "cultivate sobriety but rather ostentation." Cicero asserts that "a royal prince my little girl shall wed, for since the days of lords and dukes have sped, it takes a prince to put you at the head of the best society!" (id1, 76). Dr. Straight demonstrates his own dogged entrepreneurial spiritwith his hair and skin products and speculates as to whether he might convert Cicero into a wealthy customer whose hair he "might straighten" as well (id1, 75). Each character weaves into the fabric of a post-Reconstruction era landscape of black economic desire littered with the promise of social transformation and financial opportunity. In this way, the show embraces key black nationalist ideals which champion the importance of capitalist autonomy as a central step toward social and political empowerment.</p><p> Even so, the kind of black nationhood that In Dahomey imagined for its audiences was remarkably dystopian. The musical presents not so much the articulation of a nation as the expression of postbellum black consciousness rooted in alienation which ultimately guides and unites its characters. A musical about "chicanery and heritage," In Dahomey expresses black national identity and nation-building sentiment in vastly different ways from earlynineteenth-century black nationalism which, as Eddie Glaude points out, is rooted in negotiating "the common insult of slavery, the persistence and entrenchment of white supremacist beliefs in the social and political fabric of early nineteenth-century America." Evolving out of a turn into a new century and faced with the strange and bitter fruits of postbellum disfranchisement and mob rule, the architects of In Dahomey created a musical that parodied and critiqued the politics of racial solidarity in the midst of changing times.ππ Instead of coalition building, this was a production that repeatedly obsessed over the individual pursuit of property and the loss of precious family valuables.</p><p> If, then, early-nineteenth-century black nationalism was characterized in part by a sense of moral obligation, "we-intentions—a sense of being one of us," In Dahomey marked a break from this kind of thinking. From one brutal twist to the next, its characters cheat and manipulate each other. A minor character like the New England "widow" "clothes dealer in forsaken patterns" Mrs. Stringer imagines swindling black Southerners ("stringing them along" perhaps) into purchasing old goods (68–69), while the Syndicate’s Straight, Reeder, and Hustler, the "high society . . . gentlemen from the North wid great reputations" (76), befriend the newly minted Lightfoot family with less than noble intentions. Just as shady are Shy’s dreams of landing a job with no work involved (70) and Rare’s scheme to get a slice of Cicero’s treasure (71). Bitter ironies are piled atop one another in a script that eviscerates its own "back-toAfrica" ideals midway through the second act of the American script. In that version, Cicero declares his aim to put his trust in a "gentleman down in Cheaterville dat can find the Royal ancestors for anybody dat got fifty dollars" (81). With yet another thief potentially lurking just around the corner, Cicero’stransnational nostalgia for "a time when every darkey was a king" rings particularly hollow. Rather than promoting the notion of a mythically unified black nation-state, the script articulates the kind of existential fragmentation in black consciousness that presumably threatened to disrupt and disturb conventional postbellum racial solidarity politics. In Dahomey grapples with the (in)authenticity of racial identity formations, as well as the viability of racial unions in the wake of migration patterns, class mobility, and the increasing heterogeneity of African American experiences in the wake of seismic social and cultural change. In this regard, the musical’s capitulation toward chicanery and the characters’ rampant distrust and disloyalty toward one another operate as a broad rumination on the profound experience of postbellum black Americans’ social, political, and cultural estrangement from one another and from the larger systems that held them captive.π∫</p><p> The oft-overlooked prop that articulates the condition of Afro-alienation most profoundly appears in the first scene of the musical. Inexplicably positioned behind Dr. Straight as he lassoes his crowd into his pitch, the ambiguously titled "Intelligence O≈ce" (id1, 66) opens up a full range of questions regarding citizenship and patriotic allegiance for In Dahomey’s characters. Audience members are left to wonder who runs the "Intelligence" at the o≈ce and to what ends. Certainly the presence of the Syndicate, a heady cabal featuring Reeder, Dr. Straight, and Hustling Charlie, alluringly signifies on the possibility that one or all of the musical’s characters are spying for or on something for some mysterious cause. The potential for double-agency hangs ominously in the air of this o≈ce of intelligence where subterfuge, cloistered surveillance, and covertly alien identity lurk beneath the surface of the scene. Its presence points to something "foreign" and something infiltrating beneath the layers of In Dahomey’s back-to-Africa plot.πΩ Politically provocative, the tropes of "intelligence," "spying," and "treason" imaginatively reanimate black nationalist agendas which asserted, as Sterling Stuckey reminds, a "disaffection with American life" and a "distrust" of U.S. government sociopolitical structures. Certainly this sentiment was shared by the likes of W. E. B. Du Bois, who, in the same year of In Dahomey’s debut, famously documented in The Souls of Black Folk the myriad ways in which African Americans were forever foreigners in their own country. Pioneering nineteenth-century black nationalists such as Martin Delany thus "emphasize[d] the importance of a territorial base away from white America," which, in turn, created the seeds of Pan-Africanism that find a home in In Dahomey. At the same time, however, the production is remarkably unique in its ambitious twists and turns away from familiar black nationalist conventions. And although the musical’s vari-ous plot developments gradually move its characters out of "white America" and toward the promise of a far-off and forgotten continent, the text largely eschews classic Pan-Africanism. In a clear ideological break from the norm, rather than locating the return to Africa as a necessary endpoint in black liberation politics, the script favors a more daring and open-ended notion of diasporic emancipation and identity production altogether.∫≠</p><p> Whether audiences are greeted into the "jungles of Caboceer" as a prologue to the musical or whether they make it to shore with the cast in the original final act, the "Dahomey" scenes remain the most complicated and contested in the entire show. Yet these "African" scenes remain the most critically disregarded plot machination in the whole production—despite the musical’s title. If anything, when the trope of emigration is broached by critics, its analysis has historically resulted in frequent attempts to discount the musical as anything beyond a replication of white minstrelsy productions. Allen Woll contends that, in most cases, the back-to-Africa plot was written off by white as well as black critics who failed to conceive of its political and cultural relevance. Woll reminds us that, "despite the lofty expectations of George Walker, In Dahomey did little to enlighten audiences about African culture. Indeed, some critics believed that Williams and Walker had gratuitously put their old vaudeville routine into an African setting without the slightest thought." Black businessman Albert Ross, in a well-known epistolary exchange with the performing duo published in Variety, warned Williams and Walker that if "your ideals are degenerative you are succeeding and prospering personally and financially at the expense and to the injury of your own race and people."∫ Many read Williams and Walker’s theatrical efforts and particularly the back-to-Africa musicals as extraneous at best and politically and representationally harmful to black Americans at worst. This gesture perhaps stemmed in part from the long-standing, controversial position which the topic of emigration and territorial separation sustained within the black community and broader American politics at the turn of the century.</p><p> For many pundits, the desire to emigrate suggested an implicit critique not only of white America but of African American communities as well. In Dahomey’s Mose Lightfoot, the prevailing voice of emigration in the narrative, announces early on, "I’se just naturally disgusted with the frivolities of the colored population of dis country" (id1, 67). His sentiments speak to an undercurrent of despondency in certain black nationalist circles which seemingly depended on an aggressive critique of African American communal politics in order to endorse a subsequent literal movement out of what was conceived of as a fundamentally oppressive and debilitating environment.∫≤Mose carries on a spirited debate regarding the risks and merits of territorial separatism with Henry Stampfield, a letter carrier who is ambiguously positioned at the door of the "Intelligence O≈ce," and who is specifically characterized as harboring "an argument against immigration" in the stage directions (id1, 66). Stampfield admits that "your exalted opinion of the ideal life to be found in a barbarous country is beyond my comprehension" (id1, 67). Around and around it goes as Mose laments the state of black America embodied in Straight’s antics while Stampfield critiques Mose for his romantic attempts to mythologize Africa. With layered and savvy badinage, the scene mounts a lengthy exchange between the two characters which articulates prevailing black anxieties regarding racial identity politics and emigration.</p><p> Which view the production ultimately favors is, however, a bit more di≈cult to ascertain. Stampfield’s prediction that the Colonization Society is destined to find In Dahomey a "barbarous country" whose "natives" will "look upon you as intruders" matches many of the popular black postbellum ideas about Africa and the question of emigration. While Mose chastises Stampfield for his seeming overexposure to "white folks here in the United States," his own comments reveal a contempt for African Americans and Dahomians alike. No doubt, Mose’s disdain for "the frivolities of the colored population of dis country"—coupled with his equally regressive images of an Africa with a climate so "fine" that it is "just the right thing for raisin’ chickens and watermelons. It never snows so you don’t need no clothes" (id1, 67–68)— makes a mockery of his own political convictions. As the o≈cial mandarin of the colonization movement in the play, Mose, with his questionable politics, is just as equivocal as the Straight man before him. Described in the script as "a calcium artist," a performer who whitens his skin, Mose and his minstrelizing visions of Africans and African Americans seem to do much to critique conventional emigration proponents who knew or cared little for black communities on either side of the Atlantic.∫≥</p><p> Tellingly, the debate between these two characters in the first scene prefigures the extent to which In Dahomey strays from black nationalist and nation-building rhetoric from the previous century. Unlike early-nineteenthcentury black activists and theorists who embraced a mode of racial solidarity that stressed unity and "moral obligation," Mose and Stamp fail to articulate a language of common struggle. Mose’s vexed position on diasporic relations mirrors the ambivalence of postbellum black historians toward the continent of Africa and its connections to black Americans. As Dickson Bruce points out, black scholars of the period "saw little to be proud of in contemporary African life" and thus this sort of sentiment fueled a "civilizationist" view ofthe continent which even the most radical black nationalists endorsed. Such sentiments rise to the surface as recurring tropes throughout In Dahomey. Mose, in fact, conceives of "get[ting] a few franchises from the king to start street cars, ’lectric lights and saloons to running" on his arrival in the Dahomian state (id1, 68). Mose’s civilizationist rhetoric and his wholesale disregard for pre-existing Dahomian culture collapses into a familiar kind of nineteenth-century black nationalism whose goal was "the establishment of black ‘civilizations,’ which would give evidence of the black man’s capacity for self-government."∫∂</p><p> Rare and Shy reiterate this sentiment with zest in the show tune that closes act 1, "Broadway in the Jungle." In an absurdist song which catalogues each man’s screwball plans to appoint animals to high o≈ces once in Dahomey, Rare and Shy elaborately detail a black psuedo-imperialist fantasy focused on building department stores and railways in the pure and untouched wilderness of Africa (id1, 72–73). The return to "Africa" in In Dahomey, then, is in part a movement engineered by African American characters to retain social, political, and economic freedom but which can only be realized through mimetic rehearsals of American and European imperialism and colonization. During a period of rollicking U.S. prosperity when the gross national product soared, "wages were rising," and "American factories were running full tilt," the Williams and Walker musical reflected the Gilded Age boom by envisioning its African American characters as eager participants in American imperialist experiments. Dahomey’s promise of "plentiful" "gold and silver" (id1, 68), as Mose imagines it, hovers before the play’s characters as an enticing incentive. Africa symbolizes for these characters a tempting territory open for exploitation, an "original Klondike" beckoning the likes of Hustling Charlie to penetrate and pillage the country (id1, 71). Mose and Hustling Charlie each express a desire not just to return to the land of their putative ancestors but to repossess it in a way which, not surprisingly, mirrors the kinds of socioeconomic systems of oppression from which they initially aim to flee.∫∑</p><p> This sort of neo-imperialist ideology is driven home in the musical’s hackneyed racist caricature of Me Sing, the "Chinese cook" played by the African American actor George Catlin. Perhaps more than any other character in the musical, Me Sing endures the most overt forms of racial discrimination as he is made to weather the racial epithets hurled at him by Mrs. Stringer and the random passersby (71). As the local cook, he thus genuflects to the orders and demands of the loud and brash dressmaker. On the one hand, the doublevocality of the musical leaves open the possibility for Me Sing to operate as a cutting, satiric figure who exposes the rise of black racism toward Asianimmigrants in late-nineteenthand early-twentieth-century American culture. However, any satire in the play is undercut by the script’s dependence on unchallenged racist allusions to "pigtail" Me Sing and the "rats in [his] kitchen" (71). If anything, Me Sing’s role as the much-maligned cook seems to play into a popular strain of racial hostility toward Chinese laborers in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. As historian Gisele Fong points out, the black popular press of the 1850s and 1860s provides evidence of a complicated midcentury relationship between African Americans and Asian immigrants. For its part, the black press occasionally reinforced the public perception that African Americans were in danger of losing their domestic and custodial positions to "coolie labor."∫∏ In this light, In Dahomey’s brazen contempt for Me Sing reads as a knee-jerk expression of black socioeconomic anxiety channeled into xenophobic racial humor. What’s more, the musical’s subtle capitulation to the kinds of white supremacist, anti-Chinese propaganda which had already informed the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act paradoxically "Americanized" a musical which seemed intent on questioning the viability of life in America for people of color. By disparaging Chinese immigrants, the musical implicitly sought to make its black characters more "American" by calling attention to the grotesque physicality and uncleanliness of Me Sing. Unable to equally share in the scheming plans of Stringer and the others, Me Sing silently follows the rest of the cast all the way to Dahomey. His presence, however, reminds us that In Dahomey appears to present romantic notions of emigration only to deflate them by exposing the ugly underbelly of black greed, xenophobia, and expediency that threaten to undermine such movements.∫π</p><p> All these elements of In Dahomey’s plot taken together suggest some of the valid reasons for the musical’s critical dismissal in contemporary debates. Theatre historians and cultural critics have rightfully taken to task the reactionary elements of the production which reinforced a broad range of racial and cultural stereotypes concerning Africa as well as African Americans at the turn of the century. Without overlooking its abundant and disturbing political ambiguities, I do however wish to re-engage discussions of black nationalism in the musical in order to consider unconventional representational systems and thematic developments embedded in the script. Following the lead of Herbert Martin and Ronald Primeau, who observe that Dunbar’s work has often been "misread in ways that overlooked his ironic humor and effective parody," I want to suggest that we re-interrogate In Dahomey from within a contemporaneous social framework that exposes its cutting and sometimes confounding ironic humor. Who can say, for instance, that the very name ofthe Syndicate, whose members scheme ways to lie, cheat, and steal from their black brethren, is not in itself a signifying reference to the white entrepreneurs who dominated theatre of that era?∫∫ In short, certain contextual twists, I argue, do much to challenge the more problematic ideological points in the production.</p><p> The very terms of In Dahomey’s political ambiguity work in the service of establishing a terrain of struggle regarding (black) identity politics and push forward the terms of black cultural agency and political expression in the postbellum era. In Dahomey manifests the ways that Cook, Dunbar, as well as Williams, the Walkers, and others were wrestling with racial, cultural, and national identity formations, and it staged its own tumultuous and highly ambivalent process of (re)conceptualizing (black) nationhood and nationalist desire. The musical contested simplistic notions of "positive" versus "negative" racial images in ways which anticipate contemporary theories of "new ethnicities" posed by Stuart Hall, among other cultural studies theorists. Hall writes that "there is another position, one which locates itself inside a continuous struggle and politics around black representation, but which then is able to open up a continuous critical discourse about themes, about the forms of representation, the subjects of representation, above all, the regimes of representation." Within this context, In Dahomey provocatively distanced itself from an oversimplistic identification with the evolving "New Negro" rhetoric of the period which rested on the production of what Henry Louis Gates Jr. calls "fictitious black archetypes" of class assimilation. It also differentiated itself in unlikely ways from developing Pan-Africanist discourses of the postReconstruction era so as to stage a "continuous struggle" of diasporic black identity "becoming."∫Ω This process is staged dually through the musical’s recurring tropes of (e)migration and a fundamental (re)invention of "Africa" in the text. Both themes do much to undo and rewrite black identity in ways that transform how we might choose to read early black musical theatre’s relationship to nationalist discourses.</p><p> Even if In Dahomey’s cast of characters were to never reach their final destination of West Africa, their migratory movement serves as a culturally thematic disruption set against the African American migration narrative unfolding contemporaneously in the United States. The economic promise of the North lured "an average of 6,700 southern blacks" to uproot in Northern cities annually between the years 1870 and 1910. By the close of the first decade of the twentieth century, approximately 200,000 African Americans had moved north in search of sociopolitical and economic empowerment as well as relief from the mob violence spreading across the South.Ω≠ Indeed, thismassive uprooting was, in part, fueled by the economic prosperity which In Dahomey’s characters so desire. Significantly, however, not only do these characters choose to follow the path of emigration over migration, a choice endorsed by few African Americans at any moment in American history, but, importantly, their route is decidedly nonlinear, making pointed stops along the continuum of diverse and shifting black cultural communities.</p><p> In Dahomey inverts the direction of the African American migration narrative, anticipating the thematic re-visioning of late-twentieth-century literary works. Through the course of its travels, the production underscores an implicit critique of Northern as well as Southern social and cultural obstacles facing black Americans. In the North, for instance, we are introduced to Mose Lightfoot and an entourage of disgruntled black Bostonians willing to reject the hollow promise of Northern opportunity and move in search of social stability and the fulfillment of economic desire. Homestead’s inventory of his Northern experience in act 1, scene 1, adumbrates the critical (re)visions of the musical:</p><p> Shy: No, I ain’t mad. I’ve been laughing every since we got off that boat we come up on from down south. Ha, ha, ha. (sarcastically) I’m laughing ’cause I worked all the winter and then got worked for every cent I made while I was on the boat coming up here. I’m laughing ’cause three days after I git in town after workin’ all the winter, I’ve got to blow the bass drum in the Salvation Army to keep from starving to death. (id1, 69)</p><p> That the script calls for "sarcasm" further exposes the musical’s acerbic method of signifying as it pointedly critiques a Northern culture laden with black economic hardships. Homestead’s bitter words underscore the extent to which the North might be a place worthy of fleeing in 1902. Like the "Jonah Man" that he will prove to be, Shylock laughs from the belly of the whale, turning the occasion of his tragic luck into a rumination on the false promises of black migration to the North, labor exploitation, and a cycle of poverty he cannot escape. As Shylock, Williams’s lines here not only foreshadow the musical’s reverse geographical movement for its black characters—from north to south—to someplace else entirely—but his insistence on calling attention to laughter itself creates a richly dissonant moment in the production. This succinct and "sarcastic" narrative about laughter refuses blackface normative codes of humor by rejecting the scorn of white supremacist spectators and by making plain Shylock’s language of double-vocality.Ω≤</p><p> Rather than departing the United States from the shores of Boston, however, In Dahomey insists that its characters re-enter the South, presumably in order to (spiritually? culturally?) recuperate that historically vexed territory before moving on to Africa. Thus, on reaching the lush gardens of Cicero Lightfoot’s Florida home, brother Mose, his "Intelligence O≈ce" cohort George Reeder, and the rag-tag Pinkerton and Homestead are met by a chorus of singers performing the celebratory regional tune, "For Florida." This Florida, the chorus proclaims, is one of "verdant vale to arid stand . . . ’ere a summer land." Passionately, they declare their "loyal hearts are dear . . . Tho’ rude and black our faces be / Our hearts are brave, our hands are free / And as we sing, so shall we strive" (id1, 73). The song’s odd championing of region and (free) labor is placed in opposition to the mournful remnants of slavery retained in Cicero’s plantation, the very land which its singers celebrate. But the lyrics also convey a black tenacity in joyously reclaiming this (Southern) territory as one’s own and disrupting regional alienation born out of a sharecropping economy; the song revels in the fruits born out of now "free hands" and one’s own body of labor. Like the Emancipation Day parades of the 1890s in South Carolina and Georgia "in which African Americans successfully asserted their right to occupy" the "most prominent streets" in the South, "For Florida" signifies on acknowledging rightful ownership of a land over which black folk forever toiled. The arrival in Florida, then, resembles Harlem Renaissance black migration narratives such as Cane in which, according to Farah Gri≈n, the South "is not a place of racial horror and shame" but "a site of history and redemption."Ω≥ Here and elsewhere in the production, In Dahomey’s penchant for "romancing" the land and its plenitude is evident. As with other epic numbers, "For Florida" makes use of its large cast to colorfully and energetically occupy space, to fill up the stage with "moving, dancing, singing all at the same time" to create what Riis has called its indelible "kinetic quality" unlike any other spectacle of its time.Ω∂</p><p> The spectacular apotheosis of Florida is, however, sharply curtailed and ultimately deromanticized in one of the play’s many screwball episodes. All the characters, including the local Cicero, finally rejoice at the promise of leaving for Dahomey as a result of a financial windfall in the form of a hidden treasure discovered by Cicero (id1, 81). Hurriedly, the production pushes forward a movement which spurs the characters in search of a nation where "evah darkey is a king."Ω∑ This constant deferral in reaching Africa, the desired endpoint of emigration that arrives so conspicuously late in the production, is quite significant in reconsidering In Dahomey’s political discourses. For the "return" is seemingly less important than the negotiation of mobility. One might conceive of this movement as akin to James Clifford’s work on the dialectic between dwelling and mobility and his reconceptualization of "cul-ture as travel."Ω∏ Yet just as Clifford is cautious to not advocate or romanticize a kind of "nomadology," I am also wary of suggesting that black identity is by definition dislocated or that "travel" is free of the markers (paradoxically so) of class privilege in one sense and economic stability in another. Instead, we might consider the ways that In Dahomey posits a poetics of identity that comes as a result of the willed process of cultural and geographical transition and transaction. The musical’s performance of travel actualizes Anna Deavere Smith’s postmodern claim that "American character lives not in one place or the other, but in the gaps between the places." Smith suggests that performance itself operates as a kind of crossing of spaces in the formulation of identity.Ωπ Such an oppositional practice dislodges the reductive and essentialized readings of In Dahomey’s racial politics. The "return" in the Williams and Walker production is constantly stalled in the service of producing a revised form of Pan-Africanist discourse and diasporic identity improvised in mobile intervals.</p><p> Despite the claims of Wilson Moses that Pan-Africanism "is essentially a transatlantic phenomenon," little critical attention has been paid to the symbolic relationship between travel in In Dahomey and its revisionary stance in relation to black nationalism. This may owe, in part, to the Pan-Africanist conception of emigration championed by mainstream nineteenth-century black activists which involved reaching a territorial space where "political enclosure and national edifice can be reared, established, walled, and proudly defended on this great elementary principle of original identity."Ω∫ Coupled with the extravaganza finale which commences on the characters’ African arrival, In Dahomey’s deferred "return" in the production critiques and questions this notion of Pan-Africanist etiological desire. What gets recuperated in the place of some notion of "original identity" by the production’s concluding act is the total foreclosure of a desired "black" etiological core. Instead, In Dahomey hinges on a series of spirited falsities of identity and nation(hood) which comes further undone with the production’s final staging of "Africa."</p><p> Dragging It Back to "Africa"</p><p> When the characters of In Dahomey finally reach the "Gardens of the King of Dahomey," it seems at first glance that they have stepped into a land of the lost—or at least a world that resembles the caricature-laden "Africa" of colonial expeditions and European travel journals. With a superabundance of pageantry, the musical’s finale/prologue celebrates the "local custom" of Dahomey by piling on a series of ornate images which, as Riis points out, seem as though they could be ripped from the pages of Richard Burton’s in-famous Mission to Gelele.ΩΩ Marching bands and extras spill onto the stage and a women’s drill team "costumed as Amazons" makes way for the Caboceer army, who execute their own "precision marching drill." One flamboyant entourage celebrates the arrival of another until, as the script demands, the stage fills with a chorus dressed as "African chiefs, soldiers, natives, [and] dancing girls" (id1, 83). Together this motley crew must</p><p> com[e] to the front of the stage, knee[l] and sin[g] choral descriptive of glories of Cannibal King and Caboceers. At the middle of the choral, they rise at the words "Mighty ruler of our nation: and sway to and fro with swinging palm leaves. At the end, the chorus falls prostrate to the floor on their faces to greet Shylock Homestead and Rareback Pinkerton dressed as Caboceers. (id1, 83)</p><p> Certainly, the scene recalls the most familiar Western travel guide images of exoticized grandeur where customs of foreign and frivolous "cannibal kings" and their tractable subjects abound. Resplendent in this world of swaying foliage, the Dahomian royalty and attending Caboceers retain the "pompous ceremonial activity" that typifies Burton’s popular text from 1864. So popular were the "Amazon warrior" figures, in fact, that they had become already a staple of the ubiquitous "Dahomeyan village" exhibitions from the previous century. Translating American minstrelsy into imperialist popular caricature, Walker in this scene, as one critic would put it, "blossoms forth in gorgeous raiment and becomes a leader of black face society."≠≠</p><p> Perhaps this scene marked the birth of a new tribe of burnt-cork figures, but if it did recycle and re-order such images, few critics responded favorably to the twist. Although the pantomime had shifted into a prologue, reviewers again dismissed the abridged finale of In Dahomey as incomprehensible fluff. As one journalist scoffed in mystification, "the performance on Saturday night closed rather abruptly with a scene in an African swamp, in which the two principal comedians appeared as a savage king and queen—though with what artistic intention was not quite clear, unless to indicate a return to primitive barbarism as the ideal of the negro race" (brt). To such critics, the "Dahomian" scene a≈rmed the primal and essentially "savage" brute embedded in black performers who were artistically aimless, save for their ability to execute the "barbaric" roles of "jungle" royalty. What critics failed—or refused—to see, however, was the extraordinarily multivalent forms of spectacle and masquerade involved in a scene which required the musical’s lead performers to don exotic costumes while preserving their principal roles. Once they are dressed in "Caboceer" wardrobe, however, what Williams andWalker literally and figuratively "become" in this performance of the "Dahomian" scene remains open for debate.</p><p> On the one hand, their re-emergence as "leaders of the colored aristocracy" reinforces the neo-imperialist leanings of the production. Hailed, in the British version of the script, as "the Czar of Dixie" even before reaching Dahomey, Walker’s Rareback Pinkerton has apparently seized the kind of leadership and status that all the characters have been seeking in the musical. This "czar" title foreshadows the ways that he and his Syndicate cohorts briefly "rule" in In Dahomey with an iron fist, spouting brutal language, and threatening to "discipline" the "chocolate drops" who may "get gay" and dissident (lxx).≠ Re-dressed in the role of "African" leaders, they run the risk of ruling "jes lak white folks," as Dunbar sardonically suggests in his 1899 "one act operetto" which anticipated the shape and content of In Dahomey. That Pinkerton is even referred to as "the Czar of Dixie" provocatively aligns him with the Deep South plantocracy of Cicero’s former master John, the original "czar" in an earlier version of the script (id1, 81).</p><p> Whether one reads this transition from white czar into African neodictator as a sly commentary on black leadership run amuck or as a dig at the fall of white rule in the post–Civil War era depends on a consideration of the musical number "The Czar," a composition with lyrics by Alex Rogers and music by Will Cook and his brother John. In that number, "one of the longest" in the production, "black folks" celebrate this "modern man" with a "modern plan," the "President, the Mayor, and the Governor," a "guiding light" and a "leade[r] of his race" who "is the brightest star" (33–43). The exuberance of the number comes physically to life in the Walkers’ spotlight dance routine during "The Czar," the critics’ favorite and a moment noted for its "delightfully free and graceful character." In musical and choreographed language, then, "The Czar" operates as a synecdoche for postbellum communal harmony. An icon of black leadership realized, "The Czar" brings to life black cosmopolitanism and serves as a New Negro beacon of light for a people in transition.≠≤ In both versions of the script, "The Czar" number appears toward the close of the second act and serves as bridge into the third. Exuberant in its proclamation of rejuvenated black social and political vision shepherded in by a "gentleman," "a scholar," and "a diplomat," the song paves the way for the musical’s most curious scene of convertibility, staged in the wilderness of a far-off country. In the gardens of Caboceer, In Dahomey emerges fully as iconoclastic in its approach to re-imagining and re-articulating African American identity formation in the postbellum era. Employing the spectacle of drag as a centerpiece for this "African scene," the musical poses itsmost powerful representational intervention. Far from "barbaric," Pinkerton’s and Homestead’s new threads create the occasion for reveling in a disruptively urbane form of postbellum pageantry that might guide this cast of characters, in "czar-like" fashion, into a new era of black performance entirely.</p><p> Although photographs of the costumes worn by Bert Williams and George Walker during this concluding version of In Dahomey are scarce, two images of Walker in pseudo-"African" regalia illuminate the complexity of this sartorial sequence. In the first, which was presumably taken out of the context of the show, the photograph features the actor in his In Dahomey costume. A full, curly wig softly frames and feminizes Walker’s face and several sets of beads and shell necklaces loop around and across his neck and chest like chokers and chains. Baubles and shells swath the shoulders of Walker’s sleeveless, low-cut garment, which reveals a hint of his thick muscular frame, sinewy arms, and sculpted chest. Without archival annotation, it remains impossible to know the full context for this image. If in character, Walker, who looks tremulously into the camera, could be conjuring Rareback’s terror in the revised climax to the musical. Perhaps he is bringing to life his character’s recognition that all has gone terribly wrong in Dahomey. At the very least, the image of a timorous Walker staring into the camera accentuates the tense line that In Dahomey’s cast walked between creating fluid, insurgent and alien images that resisted the gaze of its desiring audience and falling privy to being "captured," so to speak, on film and in the act of negotiating multiple layers of popular caricature.≠≥</p><p> Making fuller sense of Walker and Williams "going native" requires, however, paying attention to the broader context of the duo’s—and particularly Walker’s—sartorial politics, both on and off the stage. We might look, for instance, to other images of the actor in "back-to-Africa" productions. In a well-circulated photo of Walker in character as "the Cannibal King" in the 1906 version of Abyssinia, the costume attests to the extravagant representational politics of these musicals which paradoxically eschewed the sartorial simplicity of the "native" in favor of redolently majestic costumes.≠∂ A towering headdress shaped by two tusk-like horns and a cluster of feathers sits atop the actor’s crown. Walker also wears an abundance of jewelry, from loose chains and angular earrings which frame the performer’s forehead to thick, wide bracelets on either wrist which fall just above his clenched fists; heavy facial makeup sharply highlights his eyes and lips. Several layers of feathers, beads, and fur drape the actor’s bare torso and a midlength animal skin covers his lower body from waist to knee. If Walker’s In Dahomey costume resembled that of this lavish Abyssinia outfit, then his portrayal of Rareback Pinkerton in the former production would have undergone a final spectacular transformation. Pinkerton’s and his partner Homestead’s quest for wealth is realized and manifested in the ornate, richly detailed costumes which they adorn in a sequence where both characters metamorphorsized into "royalty."</p><p> Just as African Americans like Henry Box Brown faced the attacks of the English public for his sartorial excess and particularly his offensive display of jewelry in the 1850s, Williams and Walker’s postbellum hypercostuming generated strong reactions as well.≠∑ Donning their splendiferous garments at the height of post-Reconstruction hostility toward African American social mobility, the duo played with the limits of black material extravagance, turning inside out the spectacle of native primitivism. The appearance of Walker and Williams dressed in costumes which referenced West African tribal costuming circumvents an easy engagement with Western fantasies of the "savage." Rather, their "African" outfits deploy a kind of drag which works as a triple transgression of sorts—disrupting racial and class as well as gendered categories. The duo’s appearance in full regalia yet still in the guise of their Pinkerton and Homestead roles plays with the boundaries of racial masquerade, producing what Amy Robinson might call a form of "Brechtian drag" wherein the "drag calls attention to the act of impersonation and foregrounds its status as imitation." Williams and Walker, it seems, cannot simply be read as "African" because the production demands that one sustain seeing them in elaborate tribal costuming and as the bumbling characters who have journeyed toward Africa from the production’s commencement as well. Thus one critic’s observation, that the conclusion offers "irrelevant pictures of native life" but that "Messrs. Williams and Walker execute a kind of ‘coon duet,’ ‘Dahomian Queen,’ in which the histrionic talents of both find excellent opportunities," inadvertently reveals the paradox of the duo’s performance (htc). Their skill at rendering "native life" underscores their talent as thespians and their ability to thus deploy racial paradigms which require "histrionic," that is, hyperbolically constructed, execution.≠∏</p><p> One can easily push a reading of this scene’s representational mayhem by examining In Dahomey’s relationship with the discourse of camp. Much has been written about the politics of camp in recent years, mostly in response to Susan Sontag’s controversial 1964 essay "Notes on ‘Camp’." In his introduction to The Politics and Poetics of Camp, Moe Meyer attempts to revise and reappropriate the dominant definition of camp popularized by Sontag. "Pop Camp," he argues, depoliticizes and denies camp its relevance, indeed, its centrality as a queer sociocultural negotiation. Sontag’s camp, Meyer contends, effectively "kill[s] off the binding referent of Camp—the Homosexual" in favor of conflating a number of "rhetorical and performative strategies such as irony, satire, burlesque, and travesty."≠π Choosing instead to reread camp specifically as "postmodern parody" which "is an intertextual manipulation of multiple conventions" (Meyer, introduction, 9), Meyer further asserts that "there are not different kinds of Camp. There is only one. And it is queer" (introduction, 5). Here and elsewhere Meyer aims to redeploy camp on the grounds of queer political agency and social intervention.</p><p> Meyer’s concerns regarding the politics of resistance might help us to consider the layered elements of parody at work in In Dahomey. Yet by locating In Dahomey within the parameters of camp which Meyer has boldly redrawn, my aim here is not to extinguish the queer politics of Meyer’s agenda. Indeed, the military penetration of "the dark continent" seemingly necessitated a kind of "queering" of colonial relations in that the phallus of imperialist projects encourages an often homoerotic objectification of male indigenous subjects as well as women. Instead, I would argue for the repositioning of camp as a politically disruptive tool in the process of marginalized identity production, that it is an equally significant element in the negotiation of African American identity construction. In this regard, I find it useful to traceChuck Kleinhans’s provocative elaboration on "low Camp," as well as Sontag’s reflections on "dandy" camp, in relation to In Dahomey’s spectacle of drag and artifice before returning to an extended consideration of Meyer’s argument as it relates to the conclusive spectacle of the cakewalk in act 3.</p><p> Dissonantly excessive, the Dahomian drag sequence of the Williams and Walker musical is a vivid example of low camp spectacle in black musical performance. Marking a distinction between various forms of parodic camp, Chuck Kleinhans contends that low camp distinguishes itself from the high in that it gaudily calls attention to the underpinnings of masquerade. While high camp is "seamless" in its "illusion of female impersonation . . . low Camp accepts the deconstructed gender presence of drag queens . . . celebrat[ing] bad taste and often intentionally offend[ing] aesthetic and social sensibilities in order to make a statement." As the "king and queen" of In Dahomey, Williams and Walker sustain roles which pose multiple low camp ruptures in representation; the actors mediate dual masking mechanisms as black performers in figurative "blackface" and as characters in "tribal" as well as queer costuming. The competing identity representations in this scene suggest a kind of parodic drag which does not simply hyperbolize "the primary intelligibility of the anatomical" and racial "body of the performer," but which renders the construction of that body as pivoting on multiple falsities, doubling and palimpsested, one after and on top of the "other." Adorned in his perennial "blackface" makeup and the "African" costuming of a "queen," Bert Williams dallies in a triple drag of sorts which magnifies the racial (in)authenticity at the core of this "Dahomian" world. The musical duo’s performance demonstrates Stuart Hall’s critical observation that the black body in popular culture was often "the only cultural capital we had." Hall speculates that, "[w]e have worked on ourselves as the canvases of representation." From this standpoint, Williams and Walker’s final act in the production operates as corporeal stylization and as an execution of multivocal narrative agency.≠∫</p><p> Yet to some, as the lead characters "go native," the musical problematically returns to its dual roots in both imperial popular culture and minstrelsy since it ostensibly freezes its social climbing black characters in a state of perpetual "barbarism." Sylvester Russell even suggested that if "Mr. Walker would dress up as an American gentleman in citizen’s clothes it would be more in keeping with the situations and the character."≠Ω Yet there is a way, I suggest, to read George Walker’s jewelry, feathers, and facial paint as the "cannibal king" as swerving free of emasculating postbellum black masculinity in order to articulate what Marjorie Garber calls a disquieting "narcissistic macho." In this context, black male drag controverts systems of social power by exacerbatingthe narrow categories of identity construction open to African American performers. Walker’s drag as the Cannibal King "turn(s) inside-out the valuation of cross-dressing, male-to-female and female-to-male, producing it not as an imposed and enslaving act of castration or ungendering, but rather as a language of reassignment, empowerment, and critique." More still, I would argue that the sartorial markers of Walker’s double role as "king" Pinkerton are in many ways congruent with the smart "gentleman’s" clothes that the actor donned with verve and elegance offstage. Both clothing choices illustrate the ways that Walker and his cohorts worked to reconfigure the (black) body as a text of artistic manipulation and as a form of cultural critique. In short, In Dahomey complicates the trope of black cross-dressing by linking Williams and Walker’s (over)abundance of costuming in this finale to George Walker’s spectacular offstage dress.̸</p><p> Costumes were a trademark for Williams and Walker productions. By midcareer, Walker had earned an impressive reputation for donning what one critic described during the 1907 run of Abyssinia in New York City as "exceedingly ‘proud clothes’ which he wears [to] illustrat[e] the love of his race for things sartorial" (brt). "Dressed," as Russell admiringly put it, "in the richest teutonic style and with his large cluster of real diamonds, George Walker" distinguished himself as the " ‘colored fashion plate’ of his race" while performing on Broadway in 1903. Walker’s lush formal street attire and his love for top hats, white gloves, and elegant suits offstage provoked puzzled and obsessive disdain from the white press. A shrewd businessman, Walker used "his own clever manipulation of the press to create an aura of stardom about himself." Within the panoptic fish bowl of postbellum black celebrity culture, journalists grappled with the performer’s "extravagant and costly stage costumes and good expensive street clothes" and even at times demanded that Walker provide an explanation for his dress (brt). The public’s fixation on Walker’s wardrobe is hardly surprising given the way that Walker’s lavish wardrobe both in and out of character easily aligned him with popular nineteenth-century dandy iconography. However, if the traditional dandy that nineteenth-century French culture bore was a "highly stylized, painstakingly constructed self, a solipsistic social icon," the black dandy figure who adopted similar traits was the most threatening of creatures in antebellum and particularly post-Reconstruction America. For, resituated in the context of free(d) urban black migrants, the hedonism, decadent narcissism, ostentation, and artifice associated with the European dandy potentially violates class boundaries. The black dandy’s refined clothing communicated a pleasure in bourgeoisie lineaments and threatened the delicate balance of racial and class relations in the wake of slavery’s abolition. The seemingly small event of dressing was, then, looked on by whites and blacks as a way to symbolically bridge the gap between the upwardly mobile dresser and the leisure class.</p><p> For Walker, the dandy aesthetic seemed to operate as its own phenomenal will to power, a nightly transgression of social boundaries that had often appeared impermeable. By re-dressing the black male body within the material codes of sybaritic pleasure offstage, Walker flaunted the visual poetics of class fluidity. Yet the volatility of this kind of image alone was enough to incur a legacy of white supremacist scorn, ridicule, and sometimes violence. As early as the 1830s and 1840s in the Northeast, the notion of the black dandy existed primarily in the fearful imagination of a white urban, working class who grew increasingly threatened by the presence of an evolving black middle class. Black dandies manifested the white supremacist nightmare of African American class aspiration realized. Transformed into the postbellum caricature of the "Zip Coon," the "slick, urbane," amoral, and mythically dangerous figure of 1880s coon songs, the black dandy icon and his grotesque Zip Coon counterpart symbolize the extent to which black male socioeconomic mobility remained terrifying and troublesome in the post-Reconstruction American imagination. Critics directly perceived Walker’s wardrobe in this light, observing that "clothes help to advertise his and his partner’s theatrical business" (brt). This "high visibility–notoriety and stylish dress" of black performers such as Williams and Walker appeared, "at least to the predominantly white, working-class mob, to embody the black bourgeoisie" on the whole.</p><p> Within this context, the drag of dandyism was both a threat and a catalyst toward the public adulation of the black body. Walker seemed conscious of the ways his wardrobe both sustained a form of persona commodification and offered access to self-authoring as well. During a 1907 press interview, the actor related an incident in which two white men approached the performer in order to ask why he wore "such flashy clothes and that large diamond ring." Walker contended that "white people would not believe I was George Walker if I did not wear them" (brt). His statement attests to the level at which Walker was aware of the fundamental artifice, in a sense the drag, involved in deploying a public persona as a black theatre performer. The actor consciously and successfully constructed "George Walker" through a metonymic relationship between his musical characters and the figure who left the theatre in the evenings. As Russell speculates, his "English dress suit and white pointed cut vest," his "English silk hat and overcoat were something a little too smart for" America. No doubt, the spectacle of George Walker’s costumingfurther managed to disturb and disrupt the essential racial "nature" which white audiences expected In Dahomey to evoke.</p><p> What black dandyism best exposed was black socioeconomic and cultural desire in a new era of class transmogrification and redefinition. Onstage In Dahomey hyperbolically articulated the hopes and aspirations of African Americans who aimed to master the art of social climbing. Ironically, no character embodied and articulated these dandyish desires more vociferously than the figure of a young woman, the ingenue Rosetta Lightfoot, played by an actress James Weldon Johnson once called "the brightest star among women on the Negro stage," Aida Overton Walker. In three of In Dahomey’s bestknown numbers, Rosetta’s character leads or enables the charge to climb. In her famous solo performance of "I Wants to be an Actor Lady," she showcases her character’s desire for professional success and mobility. Written by the white composer-publisher Harry von Tizler and lyricist Vincent Bryan, "Actor Lady" was "a jaunty ragtime number" interpolated into the musical. In her rendition of the song, Walker revealed her ability to inhabit material not expressly written for "colored performers," reanimating the song to fit and reflect the oft-invisible desires of black and particularly black female performers who longed to "star in the show . . . no back row shady." For a few dazzling minutes in act 2 , then, Walker would take center stage with "nothing but a wheelbarrow," presumably the prop of a soon-to-be-discarded rural existence, "and a looking glass" through which Rosetta might see herself and her dreams of a new life as a performer, "the real thing" who matches the talents of Ellen Terry and Carrie Brown. Rosetta’s blazing ambition echoes later in act 2, scene 3, when she robustly declares her goal to become "the leader of the color’d aristocracy." This show-stopping performance, "all full of female whimsicalities," a≈rmed her status as "the greatest coming female comedy star of her race" and, "with a grand star reception from the audience," she actualized the ambitions of her alter-ego Rosetta in one fell swoop each night onstage.</p><p> Aida Walker’s Rosetta Lightfoot operates as the archetypal voice of black social climbing in the musical. Moreover, she figures as the crucial distaff side of her husband George’s offstage dandy persona within the context of the production. While other characters scheme and plot crooked plans to seize wealth and success, Rosetta articulates through song her embrace of the "show" involved in obtaining and maintaining success across and in spite of the color line. If she is a "troublesome young thing," as the script suggests (id1, 66), and an "enfant terrible," as the British press pegged her character, the "trouble"she creates stems from her "ambition" for "recognition" which "Leader of the Colored Aristocracy" jubilantly details for the audience. Structured as a call-and-response number, Cook’s and James Weldon Johnson’s song finds Rosetta imagining her own triumphs "mov[ing] on a social plane, so very high" while the chorus rea≈rms that "she has a yearning" and "has been learning" to, as Rosetta puts it, "make the proper show" (id1, 80). Again and again the musical returns to these themes of cultural performance, the need to cultivate "ostentation" rather than "sobriety," as Cicero puts it in the number "Society," in order to break into new social circles. In short, Rosetta’s showy materialism was its own kind of "drag" show aimed clearly and almost ritualistically toward transforming her conditions and her social position, which were always in the forefront of her mind.</p><p> Like Walker and Williams offstage in top hat and tails, Overton Walker’s Rosetta onstage wrapped herself in the lineaments of fine things to move herself up and through the world. And it is Rosetta who repeatedly makes these aims explicit throughout the musical. In yet another interpolated von Tizler number, "Vassar Girl," Walker was believed to have sung about the wily chronicles of the "first dark belle" who "startl[ed] the nation" by passing for white and entering Vassar. This remarkably subversive tune, which recounts the way its heroine feigns a Madagascar identity and plays her "part so well" so that all the boys thought her "swell," amplifies the musical’s preoccupation with transgressing the color line and positions Rosetta’s character as the icon of social mobility (id1, 74). More still, "Vassar Girl" stages its own particular reversal of popular coon song passing themes which often scripted the social aspirations of upwardly mobile African Americans as the mere desire to become white. For the heroine of "Vassar Girl," education rather than whiteness is the welcome fruit of passing. Rosetta’s number here reverses popular coon song iconography which stressed the "pretensions, vanities," and "greed" of black women who longed "to change from black to white in order to gain status." Instead, the desires expressed in songs like "Actor Lady" and "Vassar Girl" gave voice to a modern—indeed perhaps a "New Negro" womanhood—committed to bettering herself professionally as well as intellectually. Walker’s Rosetta thus rewrote coon song female social climbing as postbellum uplift and rescripted the "mercenary vixen" of such songs as the would-be leader of the new "colored" elite.</p><p> The tricky line that In Dahomey walked, then, was in its emphasis on both endorsing and critiquing the passionate and sometimes selfish social aspirations of Rosetta and others. Repeatedly the musical played with the boundaries of envisioning the mobility of some of its characters while mocking andparodying the avarice of others and warning audiences of the pernicious effects that social climbing could have on black solidarity. Audiences were continuously forced to travel through a labyrinth of artifice and modes of social and cultural performance when attending the Williams and Walker musical. In this context, drag then is not so much an abrupt, non-sequitur stunt staged in the jungles of In Dahomey’s Caboceer as it is a stylized method of performance that signifies on the complex and ambiguous politics of social mobility within and all the way to the outer limits of In Dahomey. In turn, the metatheatricality of the two principal characters’ masquerade as "king and queen" operates on a continuum with the lavish offstage clothing of its stars and disrupts and decentralizes the base of Williams and Walker’s performances. The competing sites of drag at the heart of the show work to unseat the tyranny of racial authenticity politics imposed on black performers by undoing ostensibly arbitrary categories of representation. That this form of masquerade surfaces most overtly in the final act of In Dahomey is particularly significant since the drag spectacle consistently disarmed critics’ attempts to naturalize not only In Dahomey’s performers but the "African" landscape as well. The production’s finale suggests that although even Joseph Conrad in his literary visions of a raped and pillaged dark frontier "could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them," the turn-of-the-century black musical, with its spectacular, hyperbolic visual excess, potentially transformed the politics of liberation through an unconventional intervention in representing the "African scene."</p><p> The (Re)Invention of "Africa"</p><p> Nature with itself be a-vieing / A-singin’ while my babe and I parade. —"My Dahomian Queen"</p><p> Behind the curtain of "drag" in In Dahomey there lies a stunning critique of the romantically essentialized notion of the "dark continent" which perpetuated and enabled imperialist ideology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The musical’s perplexing "African" imagery not only competed with conventional representations of an "uncivilized" frontier but it also threatened to revise how Africa might be narrated and ultimately who would narrate that mysterious land in Western cultural consciousness. Founded in the early seventeenth century, the kingdom of Dahomey (which is now a portion of present-day Benin) figured prominently in the transatlantic slave trade. Bartering and brokering extensively with European slave traders, eighteenth-century Dahomian King Agaja (1716–40) played a key role in es-tablishing a port where captives were transported into the Atlantic world. In the late nineteenth century, the country struggled violently with civil unrest, political tyranny, and French colonization, particularly in the 1890s and as African American intellectual discussions and scholarship increasingly focused on African history and culture. In Dahomey auspiciously debuted in the wake of what West African historian Boniface Obichere describes as France and Great Britain’s " ‘dishonorable scramble’ for territory" in the DahomeyNiger hinterland. This battle for land resulted in the dissolution of two more African kingdoms, subsequently jeopardizing the notion of West African autonomous territories which seemed in danger of extinction by the early twentieth century.</p><p> The kingdom of Dahomey was, in the 1890s and early 1900s, another African territory annexed by adjacent European colonies in what seemed like an unstoppable steamroll of sub-Saharan expansionism peaking with the Boer War of 1902. Only Abyssinia avoided imperialist rule and, in a dramatic inversion of military strength, warded off and defeated the advances of Italian colonizers in an 1896 battle that created an international sensation. This event, perhaps more than any other, galvanized the rhetoric of global Ethiopianism and rejuvenated a vision of a liberated African continent which critics read as the underlying theme in the eponymous 1906 Walker and Williams production. Compared to the Abyssinia show and the legendary circumstances which it loosely referenced, In Dahomey seems to lack a sophisticated engagement with contemporaneous African politics. Nonetheless, it uniquely subverts systems of nationalist and imperialist spectacle by working outside conventional notions of what constitutes Pan-Africanism and diasporic cultural politics. In doing so, the musical renegotiates viable forms of postbellum PanAfricanist representation.</p><p> We might in fact think of the "Africa" in In Dahomey as dressed up in its own kind of marvelous drag. Re-appropriating the pomp and circumstance of an imperial ceremony, this Dahomey is all glamorous parade and jubilee. Two of the extended musical numbers in act 3 mount elaborate images of monarchical pageantry. "My Dahomian Queen" celebrates the unification of a nation through the conjugal coupling of a "royal" king with his betrothed. In that song, a smitten monarch imagines that love " ’twill be the grandest thing, just to hear the natives sing, as loyally they fall before my throne. Caboceers will be our sentry, ’Rabian knights will be our gentry, / The wonder of the twentieth century, / A-makin’ even sunlight fade" (id1, 83). Drenched in gauzy, romantic yearning, the song provides the occasion for its singer to woo a "Moorish maiden . . . so sweet and serene / fresh from the jungle green." Onthe threshold of a blissful future, "My Dahomian Queen" imagines a world where the sun has finally set over colonial empires, "fading" into a new era of black self-rule. Taken together, songs like "My Dahomian Queen," "Evah Darkey Is a King," and George Walker’s signature tune "My Castle on the Nile" play with notions of romance, wealth, inheritance, and genealogical reclamation. In its assertion that all "dahkeys" are linked to a royal line and, likewise, in its aim to "live extravagant[ly] in my ancestral castle on de Nile," each song translates the conjugal romance of "Dahomian Queen" into a love song directed toward the sybarite’s vision of "Africa." Each tune celebrates an extravagant fantastical landscape of promise and renewal.≤≠</p><p> Ushering in this new era of independence, the Caboceer drill teams mark this transition in power and the exuberant reclamation of space. Cook’s "Caboceers Entrance" amplifies the triumph of sovereignty. Subsequently in the song, Dahomey prepares to rise up. Ominously, its subjects warn that "before his Majesty all nations prostrate fall . . . / Their power all victorious, / Like gods of light before us, / They come, the world to sway." The Caboceers celebrate the army’s fortitude and dedication to battle. Their "armor brightly flashing, with bayonets a clashing," they pledge to "hunt the fray" at any cost. The image, like so many moments in In Dahomey, is a politically ambiguous one. The figure of the war-mad, hunting native is a powerful icon entrenched in the Western imaginary and employed as a legitimizing agent in suppressing the indigenous masses, and it was not uncommon for sensational extravaganza shows and circus entertainment to feature this kind of regimented drilling in their repertoires as a form of exoticized entertainment.≤</p><p> Yet we might reread the use of drills in this scene as a sharp signifying sequence that visually references concurrent black uplift cultural rituals. The musical’s Caboceer drills, for instance, should be understood in the context of the "spectacle of black militia units, proud in their military uniforms and . . . regularly drilling on . . . city streets or marching in major parades" in the latter half of the nineteenth century. As "disconcerting" to whites and to some blacks as these sometimes "garish" acts of exhibitionism were, such marching spectacles were frequent reminders of the many ways that postbellum African Americans celebrated and defiantly flaunted their contested access to public space and a≈rmed "the collective use of the black body for parodic play."≤≤ The scene of the Caboceers’ entrance avoids, then, the re-articulation of mere "coon song" pomp and parade, most remarkably in the complex musical composition which accompanies this sequence. In short, Will Cook’s sprightly and inventive number encompasses and articulates the heterogeneity of black cultural identity formation. In Dahomey thus took the grace,precision, and swagger of the drill rituals and resituated these events in a transnational context for African American characters seeking ways to claim "Dahomey" as a new cultural site of resistant expression.≤≥</p><p> All the romance of In Dahomey’s grand spectacles, though, cannot dispel the often troubling images of bellicose "natives" that erupt at various stages in the production. To be sure, such characterizations fall in danger of merely reproducing grotesque stereotypes of African peoples for a transatlantic audience rabid for blackface. In particular, the Syndicate characters assume minstrelized aliases as they embark on their journey to the African continent; Pinkerton’s "Cannibal King" / "King Eat-Em-All," Shylock’s "Emperor of Blasasus," Reeder’s "Lord of Jungletta," Straight’s "Discount of de Apis," and Charlie’s "Duke Monkey Faceteen." Whether these titles expose the Syndicate’s inherent fraudulence or whether they take a signifying dig at AngloAmericans who travel abroad in search of inflated gentrification (as Dunbar would attempt to do in his own variation on this theme), the Syndicate’s new names recall the ways that minstrelsy mockingly eviscerated the potency of black leadership through primitivist caricature. Likewise, the conflict that these characters weather with their African peers suggests that the show was none too optimistic about the viability of African and African American social and political relations.≤∂</p><p> Keeping these ambiguities directly in sight, we might nonetheless consider how the discourse of the spectacle might have worked in the service of African American entertainers and toward potentially revisionary ends. For if, as Guy Debord reveals, "the spectacle is the existing order’s uninterrupted discourse about itself, its laudatory monologue," then it is possible to read In Dahomey’s conclusive succession of spectacles, its invocation of wide-scale ceremony and jubilant musical numbers which spiritedly bled one into the other, as a suggestion that this mythically rendered West African region rests on the brink of renarrating itself in extravagant terms. In Dahomey transforms the function of the spectacle, the means through which nations are made and preserved, by recasting the terms by which African Americans might participate in such a process.≤∑</p><p> Beyond transforming the site of the body into a terrain of dissonant dis/ play, the production uproots the imperialist dream of a statically "savage" territory open for violation by re-appropriating the sensational exhibition of the "dark continent" and redeploying such imagery as a model of ontological intervention. In Dahomey responds to the always-expanding, generic empire’s need to naturalize the boundaries of nations and essentialize historical mem-ory by hyperbolically calling attention to the fictions of "Africa" promulgated by a Western imaginary.≤∏ The musical’s "barbaric" "Africa" underscores its own artifice and its superficiality. Its superfluous pageantry and performative ritual lays bare the juncture between the dis/play of the nation and the territory which such spectacles aim to represent. This construction of an "other" Dahomey illustrates the provocative ways that the musical generates an imaginative ideological discourse of nationhood which potentially eludes the circumscription of Western spectatorial desire. No scene in the musical played with the limits of the imperial imagination more than the notorious finale/ prologue. Billed in the script as a "scenario," a form that anticipated the African American pageants of the coming decade, the original act 3 dissolves plot almost entirely in favor of emphasizing musical numbers, colorful costumes, and populously decorous tableaux. In its early form with the scenario tacked on to the end of the show, the script moves its characters out of the States and into "Africa." Simultaneously however, the narrative grows weaker, seemingly incapable—or, perhaps refusing—its own representational cogency. This "other" place where its African American characters end up cannot, the musical suggests, finally be conventionally represented. In turn, Africa is reinvented as "Africa" in the Williams and Walker musicals, in much the same way that black bodies masquerade in the production, as an unstable point of play which transforms and re-appropriates mythically disfigured conceptualizations of race and place.</p><p> The point of In Dahomey, then, is not to represent Africa at all but to conjure an unrecognizable "African" territory that countered the nineteenthand early-twentieth-century desire for scientific "accuracy" and a tyranny of authenticity which denied black narrative authority.≤π The imperialist mission that depended on the notion of Africa as an "underdeveloped wilderness" is turned on its head in In Dahomey, where the spectator is challenged to look on a fictitiously resilient terrain of artifice. Through layers of drag and a montage of multiple musical numbers in what was a shifting repertoire, In Dahomey a≈rmed its ability to remain "unmarked." In many ways, In Dahomey resembles that which critic Robert Eric Livingston defines as Negritude’s twentieth-century "drama of decolonization." Livingston’s description of the "anti-colonial" work of Negritude poet and playwright Aimé Cesaire runs akin to the Williams and Walker musical. Just as in the drama of Negritude, where "character becomes construction" and "development takes place through the recurrent disintegration and rearticulation of the dramatic scene," In Dahomey’s fantastic and phantasmatic rendering of another coun-try suggests that what cannot be identified can no longer be conquered. The musical anticipated Cesaire’s "theatre of development" in which mounting the spectacle would itself become "a moment of cultural negotiation."≤∫</p><p> The production, then, inverts Edward Said’s influential notion of an "imagined empire" by calling attention to the cognitive and narrative agency of the performers who act out this odd "other" place. In a powerful reversal, In Dahomey demonstrates the possibility of boldly re-appropriating the imperialist strategy of inventing so-called native regions as a means of building a stronger "Europe." The musical, instead, articulates the complexities of African American identity production and the quest to invoke an aesthetic of fantasy as a counterhegemonic response to the concept of an essential territory. Moreover, In Dahomey converts Pan-Africanism’s accursed "psychological dissociation" of its emigrants, turning the crisis of cultural dislocation into an alternative form of identity articulation. The Williams and Walker musical enacted a struggle to dream intensely, and to employ what could only be read as fantasy sequences which served as responses to a naturalizing discourse which render Africa and African Americans as dreamless subjects. As cultural documentation alone, In Dahomey reveals "things Negroes were not supposed to think about, or were considered incapable of thinking about."≤Ω</p><p> The musical also offers sobering critiques of romanticized black transnationalist thought and postbellum popular culture’s increasing nostalgia for slavery. Neither the conventional black nationalist emigrationist longing for an idealized homeland nor the sentimental nostalgia for the "simple life" of plantation culture are beyond the musical’s skewering. It is little wonder then that the British script firmly squashes Mose’s quixotic African dreams of prosperity. His final lines in act 3 find him declaring that "[t]hings have been misrepresented and I for one should go back to from where I came from. And when chickens and watermelons give out in the United States, I’ll be satisfied with plain pork chops" (lxxi). And though Rare, Shy, and the other characters may, in this version’s end, follow Cicero’s plans to head back to the States as well, the production has already roundly condemned Cicero’s delusional nostalgia. In both scripts, mother and daughter Lightfoot express little tolerance for Cicero’s archaic sycophancy toward the memory of his former master (id1, 78, 81). The competing desires of multiple Lightfoots in the production underscores how these characters stand precariously between slavery’s past and the promise of a new century. No doubt, his yearnings threaten to stymie Cicero’s ability to imagine a world of black life beyond the confines of his Florida home. In this regard, In Dahomey was perhaps most startlingly incendiary and committed to black uplift ideology by way of its iconoclastic ideol-ogy and its refusal to endorse any single political line. By deromanticizing various lines of political and social thought, the production created an unlikely space for political debate and cultural interrogation by including multiple critical perspectives.≥≠</p><p> The "dream" of In Dahomey, as it were, further lends itself to a project of revising black nationalism. If, as Benedict Anderson contends, nationalism "is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist," then the musical (re)invents an "imagined" nation-state which comes as a result of the plot’s back-to-Africa movement. However, this "Africa," this fanciful "place of indeterminacy" is nowhere at all; it is a place which resists "realist" representations even as it ostensibly panders to such categories. And while British audiences reveled in the unknowability of this spectacle, "laugh[ing] and scream[ing] with merriment" over their own inability to comprehend the narrative’s significance, this act of (mis)reading registers a significant allegorical moment of disjuncture between audience and theatrical spectacle; for finally, this region of "otherness" cannot be identified, it cannot be co-opted entirely into the world of an incredulous spectator. By re-imagining "Africa" and the boundaries of (black) nationalist desire, In Dahomey wages an unlikely theatrical "revolt against empire" which came to a head at once during the musical’s stunning finale and, in particular, within the context of its legendary encore performance at Buckingham Palace.≥</p><p> "Swing Along" to the Palace: Cakewalking and the Politics of Emancipation</p><p> There was a cakewalk threatened at one stage. —Anonymous critic, Billy Rose Theatre Collection</p><p> Rather than recentering "Africa" in Dahomey, the London version of the musical made good on fulfilling the "threat" of a cakewalk for its muchcontested finale. Although the dance served in the 1900s as "a conduit for African Americans to white show business" culture, the decision among the show’s performers to unveil the cakewalk as a centerpiece to the closing act was anything but harmonious. As biographer Mabel Rowland notes, the dance "was introduced into London, only upon the insistent demand of the royal audience. The Williams and Walker Company had not the slightest intention of including this dance in its repertoire, because it was passe . . . in America . . . but in England they had heard much about it and the Mother Queen was anxious to see it." Within a week of the show’s premiere, the English In Dahomey reached its spectacular finish with a choreographed ex-travaganza that brought to life in dance American race relations and black identity formation at the turn of the century. Following the "monarchy’s" entrance and a second rendition of "Evah Darkey Is a King," In Dahomey’s script calls for the narrative to shift into two musical numbers, "On Emancipation Day" and "That’s How the Cakewalk’s Done," along with a "triumphant" dance of the same name. Theatre historians speculate that this routine lasted a whopping twenty minutes.≥≤ The transition into a cakewalk song and dance routine was a much anticipated tradition in the early black musical genre which In Dahomey ostensibly fulfilled. A dance which had its cultural roots in slave gatherings designed to reference the culture of white masters, cakewalking continues to endure as a lingering source of critical debate concerning racial authenticity politics; fundamentally at issue is the question of who is "imitating" whom in this legendary two-step romp. The dance experienced a resurgence of popularity in the postbellum era of black stage performance at which time the event was featured as a grand and elaborate conclusion to vaudevillian productions such as the traveling Creole Show of 1890 and as a spectacular processional event which served as an evening’s entertainment unto itself. By the turn of the century "the cakewalk would become the most popular element of the minstrel and early black theatrical stage, usually a grand finale with elaborate choreography and costumes."≥≥</p><p> To cakewalk at the end of In Dahomey was to some a way to conclude and contain the narrative with a return to the familiar terrain of the "happy darkey" plantation motifs often associated with the dance (Sundquist, To Wake the Nations, 276). Certainly the popularity of "operettos" and revue sketches such as Clorindy encouraged these kinds of expectations. Such productions had found great success in presenting the cakewalk as a jubilant conclusion to their shows. As Aida Overton Walker remarked famously in an interview with the London Tatler during In Dahomey’s U.K. tour, the dance was meant to convey a seamless and an infectious joy for performers and audiences alike. Arguably the leading dancer of her era and the principal choreographer of many of the Williams and Walker productions, Walker urged her colleagues and pupils who danced the cakewalk to hold "sunshine in [their] hearts. Think of moonlight nights and pine knots and tallow dips, and of lives untouched by the hardness of toil." Subsequently, from Walker’s insistence that "the success of cake-walking depends largely on temperament" came British interviewer Constance Beerbohm’s assertion that the black dancers’ "faces must be interested and joyous, and as the cake-walk is characteristic of a cheerful race to be properly appreciated it must be danced in the proper spirit—it is a gala dance" (gec).≥∂While the public may have found it easy to associate the dance with wide grins and bubbly galas, critics in more recent years have convincingly contested the easy elision of cakewalking’s social and political salience in American culture. Sundquist demonstrates, for instance, how "the cakewalk occupied a liminal territory with a significant potential for resistance, a psychological and cultural space in which the racist appropriation of black life in offensive mannerisms gave way to an African American reversal of the stereotype" (Sundquist, To Wake the Nations, 277). The notion of black performers imitating white performers who, in turn, were believed to have been imitating African Americans gives pause not only to consider what Amiri Baraka calls the "remarkable irony" of cakewalking and minstrel show theatricality but also to explore the ways in which the dance engaged with the politics of imitation, satire, and parody as black political and cultural resistance. Sundquist’s work a≈rms the way that cakewalking, under the rubric of black minstrelsy, functioned as a strategic "re-appropriation of significant elements of African American folk life, surviving from slave culture and early blackface minstrelsy alike [which] signified on the racist theory of imitation. African American minstrelsy was imitation with a vengeance" (Sundquist, To Wake the Nations, 286).≥∑</p><p> Similarly, Chuck Kleinhans has argued that cakewalking works as a kind of parody, building his use of the term on Linda Hutcheon’s significant contention that parody represents a "repetition with critical difference." Kleinhans specifies that parody is the technique which "involves the articulation of a critique by expressing a meaning different to the stated or ostensible meaning through a repetition or doubling." According to Kleinhans, black entertainers’ performance of the cakewalk parodied white aristocratic culture through a performative ritual which simultaneously went against the grain of dominant culture and yet was safely contained in its forms. Sundquist adds that through this notion of parody, black performance culture and, in particular, cakewalking preserved certain syncretic elements which were not merely "parodic attack alone" but which "recall[ed] in performative expression a cultural meaning separate from and prior to enslavement" (Sundquist, To Wake the Nations, 280). The insistence on locating the presence of "Africanisms" within the cakewalk is a crucial element in coming to terms with the representational significance of the dance, for such arguments reveal the political currency of the act as an embodiment of cultural identity.</p><p> Adding to this critical discussion, David Krasner expands on exploring the cakewalk’s negotiation of imitation as subversive parody by foregrounding what he reads as Aida Overton Walker’s highly stylized transformation of thedance into oppositional "hybridized aesthetics." Krasner advances the theory of reading the cakewalk as "double-voiced parody: a hybrid of African dance and satiric gestures aimed at whites"; he specifically considers Walker’s manipulation of the dance’s shifting semiotics and cross-cultural "lexicon of movement" to pose a hybrid form of subaltern expression for the black performer.≥∏ Borrowing from Homi Bhabha’s notion of hybridity as sustaining multiple meanings, he contends that Walker "understood how cakewalking’s fluid cultural baseline worked" and used it to her advantage in reshaping the dance aesthetically along the margins of African and Western forms. Walker, Krasner concludes, "devised a choreography that was protean, flexible, and cognizant of the mechanisms of cultural expression."≥π</p><p> Each of these critical observations aims toward a recuperative project and works to effectively demonstrate how the cakewalk served as "an example of the principles of subversion and indirection essential to the evolution of African American cultural expression" (Sundquist, To Wake the Nations, 279). Moreover, these analyses reveal how cakewalking yielded a dynamic representation of African American identity at the turn of the century. Krasner, for instance, makes a crucial link between Walker’s "hybridized choreography" and Du Bois’s theory of double-consciousness, which delineates black identity’s ongoing "twoness" of self, its "two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one-dark body."≥∫ Cakewalking transformed the ever-present "push and pull" of the Negro into a perambulatory spectacle which weaved in and out of a seemingly endless vortex of cultural "imitation" to deploy a dynamically fluid representation of African American identity. It was, according to Walker herself, "more of a walk [and] less of a dance" (brt). In other words, cakewalking served as a performance of travel that literally walked the color line of identity politics.</p><p> This latter point calls attention to the limits of defining the dance solely in terms of "cultural expression" and parodic mimesis, indeed as a radically vertiginous "hall of mirrors," as Krasner puts it.≥Ω For while such claims do much to advance an understanding of black performative agency and representational authority within the context of cakewalking, they do little to reveal the ways in which one might read the dance as not merely an expressive act but one which is, in part, constitutive of African American identity in the early twentieth century. From this standpoint, cakewalking operates as a strategy of Butlerian identity enactment, a performative practice which, through the dance itself, establishes and continuously re-assesses Du Bois’s legendary formulation of an identity constantly in contestation with itself.∂≠ Walker’s description of the dance foregrounds the processual politics of the cakewalk,how the performance forever comprises shifting and alternating paradigms and meanings which contribute to the strategic production of African American identity. She describes how, "in the walk you follow the music, and as you keep time with it in what is best defined as a march you improvise. Gestures, evolutions, poses, will come to you as you go through the dance. The partners may develop steps which they think will impress the judges. Every muscle must be in perfect control" (gec). Walker’s instructions call for the constant (re)birth of character and the performer’s own "improvisational" style of "gestures" and "poses" which set up a dialectic with the forever-rigid structure, the dominant paradigm embedded in the dance.</p><p> At the close of In Dahomey, each of the cakewalking couples danced their way through and across the "problem of the colorline." In hoop gowns and black tie, these performers elegantly enacted what Randy Martin avows is the political intent and process of dance itself. As Martin contends, dance "does not name a fixed expression but a problem, a predicament, that bodies might find themselves in the midst of, whose momentary solutions we call dancing. Unlike most political practice, dance, when it is performed and watched, makes available reflexively, the means through which mobilization is accomplished." Mobilizing themselves into the "twoness" of Du Bois’s newcentury "blackness," the company’s cakewalkers repeatedly disassembled and re-ordered the articulation of black identity formation. No doubt an "extended repetition with critical difference," cakewalking was more than an act of parody. While this kind of reading is clearly accurate, it nonetheless falls short of fully coming to terms with the ways in which the dance operates as political intervention and identity critique.∂ Such a gesture belongs, as we have seen—and rightfully so—to the discourse of camp as Moe Meyer contends. Camp, Meyer argues, is "the total body of performative practices and strategies used to enact a queer identity, with enactment defined as the production of social visibility." It is a definition "based on identity performance and not solely in some kind of unspecified cognitive identification of an ironic moment" (introduction, 5). Similarly, I find it necessary to push the politicization of black musical performance and, in particular, cakewalking as part of a strategy of performative and rigorously oppositional identity production and not merely as an expressive moment wherein identity is conveyed. In short, I propose that we read cakewalking as a form of camp, not to replicate an erasure or colonization of queer identity politics and critical discourse but to broaden Meyer’s definition of camp’s currency and to make visible camp’s black genealogical roots.</p><p> Although Meyer aims to extend the definition of parody into a "process </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> whereby the marginalized and disenfranchised advance their own interests by entering alternative signifying codes into discourse by attaching them to existing structures of signification," his analysis rests on the insistence that camp works as a specifically ontological critique and that such a critique is an exclusively "queer signifying practice." Reading camp as only queer, Meyer replicates an erasure of parallel marginalities based on race and class.∂≤ It goes without saying that camp has a crucial resonance in queer discursive histories and cultural practices; it may, in fact, be the fulcrum of queer identity politics as Meyer and others suggest. Yet I would argue that camp as a strategy is also linked to African American performances such as the cakewalk in that both the cakewalk and a broadly defined process of camp embrace and celebrate an unfixed identity which repeats its own dissonance and lack of closure. With this in mind, rather than displacing queer positionality, I am arguing for a way to consider the relationship between these oppositional performances. Queer camp and the camp of cakewalking are not a conflated form of identity production; rather each works in the service of dismantling a dominant ontological paradigm.</p><p> This reformulation of cakewalking as a kind of camp and as a constitutive strategy in renegotiating marginalized identity politics necessitates a more focused consideration of the dance’s positioning as an extended, twentyminute performance at the close of In Dahomey. The majority of critics tend to decontextualize the cakewalk as a performative act, suspending it from narrative depth and significance. They choose to read the dance as a complex, yet plot-free, non-sequiturial theatrical moment which either holds the narrative in abeyance or delimits its parameters altogether. In her study of African American dance, for instance, Jacqui Malone suggests that In Dahomey served as a "vehicle" which, nonetheless, "lifted the cakewalk to the status of an international dance craze after the show’s smashing London run of 1903."∂≥ A number of critics tend to foreground the production’s ability to present the cakewalk as a cross-over success which captured the fascination of white audiences; yet little critical attention is paid to the relationship between cakewalking and plot development, specifically how cakewalking advanced the play’s fundamental themes.</p><p> Not surprisingly, to contemporary reviewers of the musical, the cakewalk finale additionally accentuated the rapid dissolution of In Dahomey’s already "flimsy" plot development. The bewildered London Times critic viewed the dance as a predictable conclusion and a manifestation of the production’s chaotic structure, observing with a tinge of ennui, "[o]f course, In Dahomey concludes with a ‘cake-walk,’ a real cake-walk with a real cake, which isawarded, by acclamation of the audience, to the most frenzied among the pairs of dancers. In ‘epileptic’ dancing these coloured people are, as was to be expected, quite unrivaled" (htc). The musical ended, to these reviewers, as it had begun—in absolute disorder.</p><p> Aida Overton Walker’s interviews and articles on cakewalk instruction and the fastidious discipline of the cakewalk dancer whose "every muscle must be in perfect control" (htc) counter this kind of oversimplification of the performance, as do the many analyses of the promenade which link its rhythmic marching style and music to an "explicitly military nostalgia" (Sundquist, To Wake the Nations, 289) evolving at the turn of the century. If anything, cakewalking’s two-step pattern appropriated the patriotic marching band aesthetic which, Malone argues, "seemed to embody America as it liked to see itself— cocky, stepping to a proud beat, ready for any change."∂∂ Read from this perspective, the finale of the cakewalk as a transmutated marching band parade with its hubris and extravagance ushered in the change of (black) identity which the dance, itself, continuously (re)enacted through camp. This extended repetition of difference—of African American identity in motion— appropriately capped In Dahomey’s conclusion as it reached the alien terrain of "Africa."</p><p> More than anywhere else in In Dahomey, the characters find the rhythm to "swing along" in the cakewalk finale and, in doing so, they tap into a choreographed "response" of sorts to the dense and equally heterogeneous musical "call" which opened the show. Both the music and lyrics of "Swing Along" forecast the pomp and circumstance of the musical’s journey. "Singing in unison and fortissimo, and anchored by forceful orchestral accents on the beat," the cast proclaims the pleasure of parade and the splendor of exhibitionism. In "Swing Along," In Dahomey’s characters seize back from the hands of white show business managers and entrepreneurs the right to proudly exhibit themselves. Cook’s number thus encourages black subjects to "swing a-long chillun, swing a-long de lane, Lif ’ yo’ head and yo’ heels mighty high." The number lyrically rewrites minstrelsy’s grotesque lampooning of black soldiers, marching units, and parades. Whereas minstrelsy conceived of African Americans as "harmless strutters," "Swing Along" imagined an insouciant black strut that was all the more disconcerting because of its marchers’ carefree joy and direction. With culturally informed political intent, the song metatextually signifies on the exigencies facing black performers in a crossover musical production; "Swing Along" disruptively reminds that "white fo’ks awatchin’ an’ seein’ what you do," and in doing so, makes a sophisticated gesture toward foreshadowing the Brechtian actor’s "awareness of beingwatched." The key to Cook’s savvy composition is to turn the constrictions of the gaze into a moment of longing, in effect to expose the deep-rooted crossracial desire informing white spectatorial politics. "Swing Along" assures that "white fo’ks jealous when you’se walkin’ two by two, So swing a-long chillun swing a-long." Originally positioned at the end of the show, "Swing Along" celebrates the emergence of a black subjectivity proudly willing to occupy public space and to revel in the pleasure of grand and impressive communal elegance and camaraderie. If, as Riis compellingly argues, "Swing Along" "stands as no less than a synecdoche for the entire production," then the cakewalk finale represented that composition’s translation into corporeal movement.∂∑</p><p> Two additional musical numbers often performed during or near the finale amplify the engagement of "Swing Along" with white spectatorial desire. Dunbar and Cook’s ragtime number "Emancipation Day" and J. Leubrie Hill’s "That’s How the Cake Walk’s Done" envision parodic inversions of identity which clear a space for renegotiating "black" and, more broadly, American identity in the spirit of the cakewalk. The former proclaims that "On Emancipation Day / All you white fo’ks clear de way / Brass ban’ playin’ sev’ral tunes, / Darkies eyes look jes’ lo’k moons." The lyrics juxtapose residual minstrel codes with visions of a presumably post-enslaved black culture built on artifice and disguise. Viciously lampooned in minstrelsy, the Emancipation Day parades of postbellum black culture resurface in In Dahomey in the hands of a new world order. In this remarkable universe "coons" are "dress’d up lak masqueraders, Porters arm’d lak rude invaders," and "White fo’ks try to pass fo’ coons on Emancipation Day." The vision here is not so much a facile inversion of power dynamics and social positioning, where African Americans displace "white folks" in the system of aristocratic order. Rather, the song celebrates a "pass" of another sort, a mode of exchange in which blacks and whites experiment with the "Straight" practices handed down from act 1. And while white folks may "try to pass" across the color line, the song assures that the darker races will succeed in donning the garb not of whites but of masterful "masqueraders." On "Emancipation Day," the song suggests, the black performer will discard the "coon’s" clothing and enter into the cakewalk’s continuous space of transformation and renewal.∂∏</p><p> Elaborating on these themes, "That’s How the Cake Walk’s Done" describes a world where social and cultural borders are disrupted by the "dance craze" which, as Krasner maintains, "was one of the first culturally expressive forms to be used as a cross-over commodity and to transgress the racial divide." The land which In Dahomey’s characters find themselves in by act 3 isone beset, as the lyrics put it, by a "Cake-walking craze, it’s a fad nowadays / With black folks and white folks too / And I really declare it’s done ev’rywhere." Cakewalk fanaticism in the song’s vision spreads across racial as well as national borders so that even "[t]he Parisians, you know, they all walk just so / They call it ze cake walk dance / But with me you’ll agree / That the folks from Paree / In this cake walk would have no chance." This global phenomenon opens a field of possibility for a romanticized transnational unity sustained by the enactment of the dance. Likewise, the dance follows Kleinhans’s extended characterization of camp as well, in that the song demonstrates how the cakewalk "draws on and transforms mass culture." The cakewalk in In Dahomey threatens to intercede in and revise global power relations through the spirit of the dance. Yet the lyrics simultaneously remind audiences that none of its new disciples compare to the (black) dancers who demonstrate the processional in the song. Cakewalking, thus, unifies even as it calls attention to the superior skill and narrative authority of the "Black folks in Tennessee" who, according to the lyrics, "introduced [cakewalking] years ago down in Dixie."∂π</p><p> This magisterial promenade at production’s end, then, mounts a dual performance wherein the process of "becoming" and of rehearsing African American identity is staged and where a final, imperialist intervention is waged on "Emancipation Day." This sort of extravagant ending was not, however, palatable to some British theatregoers. For despite the fact that London "audiences expected black Americans to dance the cakewalk," this performance of the promenade left audiences adrift. Most critical observations of the period claimed that this confusion was occasioned by a lingering crisis in plot which permeated the production from beginning to end. One reviewer described how "the audience sat helplessly wondering whether the performance was at an end. It was not till the orchestra, a few minutes later, played the national anthem that the house recognized that the entertainment was over and filed mystified out into the rain" (brt). Only a rousing rendition of "God Save the King" was said to curb the crowd’s perplexity.</p><p> Although, as Jeffrey Green points out, this rendition of the national anthem was fairly customary in England for much of the twentieth century ("In Dahomey," 24), it is, nevertheless, an extraordinary form of social and political symbolism with which to mark In Dahomey’s conclusion. The anthem’s presence at all in the context of theatre culture suggests the ways in which imperial regimes systemically constricted and bound the borders of nineteenthand early-twentieth-century cultural spaces. Further, this recurrence of "God Save the King" at the end of the production each night reflects the turn-of-the-century English dramatic production’s shifting politics which were forced to accommodate and "to accept the binding closure of the discourse and practice of imperialism instead of producing a cultural rhetoric of its own." In Dahomey’s refusal to follow such guidelines, its inability to reproduce the script of British blackface minstrelsy’s entrenched celebration of an imperialist "social and cultural pre-eminence" centered in the U.K., warranted an intervention. Thus, to play the national anthem at the close of this extended cakewalk—a simultaneous performance of black identity production and an articulation of transglobal popular culture—at least symbolically illustrates the state’s attempts to contain the insurgent politics of both the dance and the production.∂∫</p><p> Whatever "threat" that the cakewalk posed to the sovereignty of its British audience’s social and cultural positionality, the nightly rendition of "God Save the King" potentially restored a kind of cultural order through what Benedict Anderson calls the "experience of simultaneity" in the language of nationalism. Anderson argues that "there is a special kind of contemporaneous community which language alone suggests," and that singing the national anthem provides a notion of "unisonance" in the making of "imagined" national communities. His point underscores the ways that the generic anthem offers for audiences a sense of belonging to a higher national order, of being united within a chorus of familiarity which celebrates the preservation of a romanticized monarchical forebear.∂Ω One might consider, then, how cakewalking, in many ways a national anthem of its own, went head to head with the putative white imperial audiences in both England and America by attempting to stage a performance of black nationhood and (counter)cultural sovereignty as a spectacle of resistance. While songs like Will Heehan’s 1901 number "Every Race has a Flag but the Coon" disparaged the notion of black social and political identity formation, In Dahomey’s transatlantic imaginary, its extravaganza of emigration presented a response to the incredulous white spectator who scoffed at the validity of African American national identity.∑≠ In this way, the production extended and theatricalized the goals of the PanAfrican Congress which, two years earlier in London and with a critical mass of black scholars at its helm, had declared that "the world was called upon to respect the integrity and independence of the free negro states." With aims to seize the global spotlight, the Congress called for an international audience to recognize black sovereignty on the rise.∑ In Dahomey, however, translated this performance of nationhood before the imperial audience into a final metatheatrical parody of monarchy and international relations. No moment encapsulated the musical’s ability to reinterpret freedom and independencemore profoundly than the scene at Buckingham Palace on June 23, 1903, when the cast performed before the royal family.</p><p> After a month’s run in London, the Williams and Walker Company received a royal invitation to perform what was billed as a "command performance" for a palace birthday party in honor of the young Prince of Wales. The Shaftesbury Theatre was, in its entirety, essentially transferred to the palace grounds with full scenery and costume for the purposes of the production. As Ann Charters describes, "the show had been slightly modified and abridged" for the purposes of performing for the Prince; in turn, the production was received enthusiastically by King Edward VII and his family and subsequently the show maintained a lengthy stint for the duration of the year in the U.K. If there was any tension or apprehension surrounding the Buckingham Palace visit, it was perhaps felt most acutely by Bert Williams, who allegedly had "wondered whether it would be acceptable for him to sing " ‘Evah Darkey Is a King’ " before the royal family.∑≤ His anxiety was ultimately dispelled, however, for seemingly the audience and the British press alike read the performance as an innocuous, self-reflexive mockery of black political autonomy. Within days of the visit, the English publication The Era commented that, for instance, the palace performance "was a very happy and cheerful note that was struck between the bogus king and the people of a bogus country and the real king—the King of England" (Green, "In Dahomey," 36). To the press, the Buckingham Palace production of In Dahomey reinforced the ine≈cacy of a fictitious black nation and its subjects’ willingness to genuflect before the godhead of the English empire.</p><p> George Walker, however, recalled the scene at the palace quite differently. Recounting the visit in detail, he wrote, "We were treated royally. That is the only word for it. We had champagne from the Royal cellar and strawberries and cream from the Royal garden. The Queen was perfectly lovely, and the King was as jolly as he could be and the little princes and princesses were as nice as they could be, just like little faeries."∑≥ Walker’s infantilization of the ruling monarchy is fascinating in the way that his language safely depoliticizes each member of the family, transforming them into "lovely" and "jolly" hosts who treat their black guests as "kings" and "queens" (for a day). His allusion to the family as "little faeries" is equally daring and peculiar in that his words flirt with infantilizing his monarchical hosts in ways similar to minstrelsy’s incessant rendering of black folks as children. Within the context of Victorian and Edwardian culture, there is a way to also read Walker’s amusement with the royal family’s fairy-like traits as another kind of sly and signifying remark. For his comments effectively transform the king, queen, little prince, and their company into the kinds of a-human, "Ur-child" (non)entities that populated storybooks and pantomime shows of the era. In Walker’s vision, the monarchy metamorphoses into the Victorian fantasy figure of the "fairy" whose "nature," as Nina Auerbach points out, is akin to that of a child. Fairies are "always sliding into the other orders of being," and, she argues, they sustained their power in nineteenth-century British culture as an incessant reminder of Great Britain’s increasing uncertainty with the Self.∑∂</p><p> Leave it then to Walker to turn the spectacle of transformation back onto the white (royal) spectator. His topsy-turvy comments were, however, colorfully prefigured on the palace lawn during the demonstration and instruction of the cakewalk which followed the In Dahomey performance proper. As legend has it, the dance so caught the attention of the royal family that they staged a subsequent cakewalk contest of their own, with the black performers serving as judges.∑∑ The Era reported that, after having corroborated the authenticity of In Dahomey’s cakewalk, "it was noted that while the members of the company were tripping the light fantastic on the improvised stage the children of the Royal Household gave very fair imitations on the beautifully arranged lawn. Both Mr. Williams and Mr. Walker were enthusiastic as to their reception" (Green, "In Dahomey," 37). At Buckingham Palace in 1903 the imperial order’s dreaded dissolution and imminent transmogrification of power dynamics was well under way in the form of a cakewalk.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
