Introduction: Are You Hip to the Jive?</p><p> 
(Re)Writing/Righting the Pan-American Discourse</p><p> Afrogenic simply means growing out of the histories, ways of being and knowing, and interpretations and interpretive styles of African and African Diasporan peoples. It refers to these communities’ experiences, priorities, and styles, and their articulations of them while acknowledging that most human behavior is not intellectually articulated by the actors who perform it and that plural interpretations of similar behaviors are obviously possible. </p><p> U.S. African Americans have used “hip” and “jive”, words from Wolof, the principal language of Senegal, to make significant epistemological and hermeneutical statements about ways of knowing, understanding, and interpreting life. “Jive”, from jef which Senegalese Wolof speakers translate into French, their official national language, as pas sérieux (not serious), proves most useful for the extremely serious intellectual overhaul that Yai proposes. </p><p> “Hip” means to have one’s eyes wide open, to be keenly aware, as well as to make others aware. “Jive,” as Afrogenically used by U.S. African Americans, relates to the art of dissimulation. The dictionary, which probably does a fine job for Eurogenic words, defines dissimulation as “to hide under a false appearance,” derived from “simulate,” meaning “to give or assume the appearance or effect of, often with the intent to deceive.” It defines jive as a “special jargon or difficult slang,” and as “glib, deceptive, or foolish talk,” as if these three terms were comparable.</p><p> The idea of a special jargon is probably more accurate than intended when one considers U.S. African American English as a linguistic system originating in a situation of enslavement, and involving deliberate dissimulation and subterfuge as a fundamental and essential survival strategy. The definition of jive as glib and foolish talk, although accurate on a superficial level, represents a trivializing perception of a term involving much greater interpretative profundity, and reflects an external perception that fails to account for the considered intentionality, and the sense of deliberate agency, of consciously deceptive, jive-talking African and African Diasporan actors and actresses. The definition also indicates that the jive worked if it was understood so superficially.</p><p> Africans enslaved in the Americas found themselves in a situation in which they could not possibly tell the truth to their European and Euro-American enslavers who did not even acknowledge them as human beings… These Africans would hardly reveal their truths to those who bought and transported them… whose concept of truth, whatever it may have been, was obviously the antithesis of that of the people they sought, unsuccessfully, to dehumanize. </p><p> An African American saying states that “I’ve got one mind for my master, and one mind for myself.” I’ve got a jive version of what I think/believe/know for the person who tries to control me, and I keep my real truth for myself and my people. What was perceived as glib and foolish talk by those who were intended to be deceived often protected the profound truths of those who were consciously, carefully, and selectively deceiving. </p><p> The concept of jive as deception and dissimulation must, however, be applied in both directions. The first concerns the ways in which African Americans jived their white enslavers in order to resist their efforts at total control and joked among themselves about doing so. The other is the way in which white enslavers invented and presented jive versions, deceptive misrepresentative versions, of African, African Diasporan, and consequently Pan-American history to the world, and pretended that it was the truth, perhaps joking among themselves about “getting over” on their victims—both materially and intellectually. The dissimulative way in which the story of the Americas has been told, such that it denies, minimizes, and distorts African and African Diasporan roles in it, has been successfully jive in that it has deceived everyone, even convincing of its validity many of the very people whose experiences it has misrepresented. </p><p> This presumed absence of African culture worthy of serious respect has deprived U.S. and other African Diasporans of an accurate sense of meaningful origins to make profound sense of significant behaviors. It has deprived all Americans of a way to account for Pan-American Afrogenic behaviors of whose origins almost everyone is unaware, or maybe uninterested in recognizing or unwilling to acknowledge. It has also permitted the history and present of the Americas to be told in a partial, hence fictional, rather than complete, hence accurate, manner. The result is that what should be the commonly told story of all of us in the Americas is only the partially told story of some of us. </p><p> Looking up words in the dictionary, rather than being the banal act I had anticipated, proved to be an unanticipatedly Eurocentric experience…The one word of the Wolof linguistic complex I identified for which an origin, a Eurogenic origin, was provided, misrepresented both the source of the word and the experiences of the African American speakers who most publicly use it. </p><p> …looking at the Americas through a glass darkly, so to speak, as a corrective to the whitewash that has obscured the rich and complex multicolored mosaic that the societies of Pan-America really represent</p><p> Brenda Dixon Gottschid (chapter 3) suggests that in order to understand what she terms the “Africanist” presence in the Americas, we should reverse positions and view American cultures as Africanist, looking at presumable Euro-American behaviors through an Afrogenic black light that highlights different forms, that shines light on things imperceptible in the usual Eurogenic white light—black light highlighting things invisibilized by white light, so offering different interpretive models. </p><p> To think Afrogenically involves an active, deliberate, and vigilant process of mental decolonization. As a result of both Eurocentric formal education and the informal education of everyday life in the Americas, we have all been taught, as Shelley Fisher Fishkin says (chapter 2), to assume whiteness rather than blackness as the origin and explanation of American behaviors. </p><p> We were to believe what we were told, rather than what we saw with “our own lying eyes.” </p><p> The Myth of the Negro Past by Melville Herskovits, provides extensive African and African Diasporan data to support the idea that U.S. African Americans have an African heritage.</p><p> Shelley Fisher Fishkin: “the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant civilization of the United States was itself shaped from the start by people and traditions who were not white, or Anglo-Saxon, or Protestant.”</p><p> The Afrogenic nature of things gets ‘lost’ as they become part of presumable white, Eurogenic, national cultures. Their African ancestry is not denied, because that would involve acknowledging the possibility of its original presence. It is rather forgotten, is quietly ‘disappeared,’ becomes ‘unknown,’ in an amnesia of former blackness, induced and enforced by authoritative voices of assumed whitenes. </p><p> The categories American and African American/African Diasporan are sometimes mutually exclusive and sometimes overlapping, sometimes antagonistic and sometimes complementary, but always a source of at least ‘two thoughts’ of some kind of duality, or more likely multiplicity, of experience and/or perspective. This double or multiple consciousness, however, need no longer be a source of ‘unreconciled strivings.’ This splendid ‘gift’ of ‘second sight’ can, on the contrary, now function as a conscious source of both experiential and analytical riches—of simultaneously multiple, and necessarily critical, perspectives in response to the contradictions between one’s own experiences and the ‘revelation[s] of the other world.’ And the idea of being ‘born with a veil,’ according to the U.S. African American epistemology with which I am most familiar, implies the ability to see beyond the ordinary realm that others see, even to perceive different dimensions of reality, hence a gift with empowering ramifications. </p><p> to contemplate one’s reality from both inside and outside — sometimes simultaneously </p><p> It is also quite possible, within the perspective of Afrogenic double consciousness, that rather than these meanings being either/or, either of African or of Euro-American origin or inspiration, they were and are both/and for African Americans, who are part of both realities. </p><p> Being hip to the jive involves having one’s own eyes wide open to perceive the truth through the veil of others’ mystifying and mythifying reality-negating revelations. </p><p> To maintain and (re)create as much culture as they did, Africans clearly had to use multiple techniques of camouflage and dissimulation. They had to be, and the results prove that they were, both hip and jive. This dissimulative resistance to imposed assimilationist efforts by appearing to conform on the level of visible behaviors, but with different intentions, meanings, and goals from those intended by their enslavers, is similar to Vlach’s discussion of African foundations and meaning in African American material culture. All over the Americas Africans and their descendants who were hip to the jive cloaked African and African Diasporan meanings in Eurogenic garb, jiving those they intended to deceive into believing that they had really acquiesced to their jive. </p><p> As in Venezueala, all over the Americas members of the African Diaspora, like all other Americans, have been systematically (mis)educated to see Africa as savage and ahistorical based on the kinds of myths evoked by Joseph Harris. These systematically inculcated (mis)perceptions have inclined African Diasporans not to want to identify with such a problematic past and to underestimate our ancestors’ participation in the development of the Americas. </p><p> The issue of resistance to enslavement among African Diasporans is obviously a very important issue because it is a key demonstration of agency and accomplishment. The acknowledgment of such agency creates an intellectual problem when the goal of a system is to disempower a people, enslavement representing the ultimate disempowerment. Demonstrations of agency and accomplishment have to be denied through dissimulatory intellectual tactics of nonacknowledgment, distortion of meaning, logic-defying interpretations, and misattribution. </p><p> The African Diaspora continues within the Americas, creating further layering in a continuing dynamic of intradiasporan encounters and increasingly multiple consciousness. </p><p> This is a valid form of knowledge…that needs to be recognized as such rather than devalued as mere entertainment. </p><p> As foundational constituents of all the societies of the Americas—although as unequal constituents who worked much more and benefited much less than Euro-Americans—they helped determine the basic forms these societies have taken and the ways in which they function today. </p><p> African contributions are part of their deep structure…as such they contrinue to express themselves in many ways seen and unseen, named and unnamed, somewhat known and mostly still to be known. </p><p> Denial, however, does not make things go away, even if it may intellectually exclude or obscure problematic presences. Such denial rather obliges the deniers to lie, to dissimulate, about eh presence of the subject of the denial in a variety of ways, such as “origin unknown,” with or without Eurocentric misattribution. It requires imaginative styles of erasure and invisibilization such as writing African and African Diasporan subjects of denial out of selected parts of the story by simply whiting us out. </p><p> It is not clear whether it is more deleterious to be told that you do not exist, as was the case for the Afro-Uruguayans, or not to have your existence doubted but rather to have it declared originless and pathological, as in the United States. Both this nonexistence and this pathology were claimed in contradictory situations in which the cultural creations of the communities that did not exist, or were pathological, were simultaneously appropriated by the same segments of the society that made these negative determinations. </p><p> the fundamentally jive nature of the authoritative story told of the Americas </p><p>
