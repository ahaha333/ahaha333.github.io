<p> </p><p> So here is a book which is a bad deed. I no longer have the right to ignore it. I have been told. Even I was told it again.</p><p> </p><p> I was also taught, during this trip to Black Africa, various other things: that I was a half-breed, a Jew, a liar, a acrobat, a snowman no higher than an apple, a scoundrel , a contemplator of French work, a swine flu, a cigarette butts collector, a little joker, a thug, a dubious business agent, a dingo, an ungrateful, a vile serialist. And as for the only man who called me master, he wanted to tell me that I was more of a singer than a writer.</p><p> </p><p> Everything that carried a torch in the colonial newspapers came to heat my soles. Definitive special editions have been launched against my fugitive person. The great colonialists on the boulevard have torn me up and down low, in the name of history, medicine, politics, economics, society, the settler, gold, Niger, the Seine and the Congo. Under the title: "Those who will not respond to Albert London", rigorous logicians scrolled in a mournful frame the names of the colonists, officials, traders who died in 1928 in French West Africa, this in order to prove irrefutably to the country that I had my nose in the middle of the forehead, my heart in a jar of vitriol, my tongue laden with bad faith and that everything was fine there! Letters brought by the last letters announce to me the formation, in Upper Volta, of a new crusade. Men rise from all sides to the cry of: Routine wants it!and are preparing to march, no longer against the Muslims, but against the Iroquois, each competing for the honor of being the first to break his face. In the meantime and to make me patient, they drag my eighty-two kilograms to court.</p><p> </p><p> It’s nothing.</p><p> </p><p> Nothing.</p><p> </p><p> Colonial newspapers do not flood the country, they only soak their subscribers. Was it enough to create an irresistible current? Not all did. Now the knights appointed by colonization need to carry a corpse before the eyes of the people of France, a corpse which will call the just imprecations of the initiate and the avenging stones of the popular. This corpse is chosen. Horror! it's mine !</p><p> </p><p> I will go, thus, at the mercy of the lulling flow, my poor dear little body tied up on a cork board, my right hand severed, guilty of having written, my feet charred and my last chapter (before, under threat , I will have devoured all the others), blooming between my teeth like a poisonous flower.</p><p> </p><p> The general government of French West Africa decided the thing.</p><p> </p><p> He has just invited twelve journalists and twelve parliamentarians, in the hope that these twenty-four people will find that those who, until now, had taken me for a man and not for a donkey, would do well to realize that 'They have no ability to distinguish the human race from the domestic fauna.</p><p> </p><p> At this hour, fatal hour, these missionaries disembark in Dakar.</p><p> </p><p> The Minister for the Colonies is also getting there.</p><p> </p><p> May the ebony earth be lenient to them all.</p><p> </p><p> For me, I have little more to say, and it is this: I do not take anything away from the story that earned me so many baptismal names; on the contrary, my conscience is very calm, I add. This book will prove it.</p><p> </p><p> On the other hand, I remain convinced that a journalist is not an altar boy and that his role is not to precede the processions, his hand plunged into a basket of rose petals.</p><p> </p><p> Our job is not to please, nor to do harm, it is to carry the feather in the wound.</p><p> </p><p> In French Black Africa there is a plague. This plague, let's give it its name, is: indifference to the problems to be solved. And that leads to disasters. Whose fault is it ? The fault is less with the colony than with the metropolis.</p><p> </p><p> When your light bulb goes out in your room, you are not attacking the bulb, but the sector.</p><p> </p><p> The sector of the French colonies is France.</p><p> </p><p> Well ! if the current is not very strong between France and Dakar, it is cut between this same France and Brazzaville.</p><p> </p><p> It is not the men I denounce, but the method. We work in a tunnel. No money, no general plan, no clear idea. We are groping civilization.</p><p> </p><p> Also, negroes go into exile, others die. The revolt rises in the Oubangui-Chari. While being stifled, the Colonial Office said that it was optimistic and that it did not believe in these things.</p><p> </p><p> And France is happy to be deceived.</p><p> </p><p> What could we throw on such a table?</p><p> </p><p> A veil or a little light.</p><p> </p><p> To others the veil!</p><p> </p><p> It was Dakar!</p><p> </p><p> This block of white stones: the palace of the governor general.</p><p> </p><p> On our right: Gorée, the island where the last slave traders loaded the last slaves on a boat called Rendu .</p><p> </p><p> The Rendering that never returned anything!</p><p> </p><p> The passengers on our liner were already in helmets and in white. Everyone had been taking quinine since morning. We had said goodbye to the pleasures of drinking well, eating well, breathing freely and above all having dry hair. On my own, I was studying how to replace the handkerchief with a terry towel. It looked like we had put the sky and the sea under mica. Nature was congested. It was Africa, the real, the cursed: black Africa.</p><p> </p><p> The Quai des Chargeurs-Réunis was waiting for us. The Belle Isle accosted.</p><p> </p><p> "Stay with us," said the commander. There it is the country of the Devil!</p><p> </p><p> I had touched Dakar in time. I remembered it was at night during the harsh month of September. Heat rose from the ground, came out of the walls, fell from the sky. The traveler knew the sensations of the bread that one bakes. The city was soaked with oppressive sadness. I then went at random, without hoping to get lost, feeling that it was not great. Dakar, gateway to our black empire! What was behind? From this first contact, two memories: the phonograph tunes that roamed the streets of the administrative district, European tunes trailing like exiles in a country where they felt lost; and, further down, in the dining room of a hotel called Métropole, a hundred whites younger than old, without jacket, without vest, shirt open on bare chest and lifting with a heavy fork a piece of bidoche which hardly tempted them. The settlers !</p><p> </p><p> Two other times I had been unable to touch Dakar. It was forbidden. Dakar was plagued. The boats fled it with any machine, spinning from Madeira or the Canaries directly on Pernambuco or Rio de Janeiro. It was at the time of yellow fever.</p><p> </p><p> Nice weather! Nice fever!</p><p> </p><p> This did not prevent France from sleeping. Who knew it? However…</p><p> </p><p> "Come on," said a letter found to me after returning from a trip, "come and see what is going on in Dakar." We are one hundred and twenty-eighth dead (white). As long as we don't say anything, we can pass away. We reserve a cage for you in our house… Come. "</p><p> </p><p> The nightmare lasted five months. One and a half dead a day! The women and the children were gone. There were only men left, which was fine! The priest who buried in the morning was buried the next day - civilly! In the 150th corpse, eminent doctors disembarked from Paris, a mosquito repellent slung over their shoulder. You should know that yellow fever comes from a mosquito called stegomia . You couldn't ask the mosquito that bit you if it was a stegomia. It does not speak, these animals! See the head of the colonist every time he scratched, that is to say all day and all night!</p><p> </p><p> Measures were taken. Doors and windows would be screened. We would not eat, we would only sleep in a cage. From six o'clock, everyone would be at home, or else we would go out with boots on, gloves on, and wearing a hood.</p><p> </p><p> We live that.</p><p> </p><p> Dakar was haunted by ghosts, gloved and hooded. By not forgetting that it was immediately, when night came, a little warmer than during the day, you will have an idea of ​​the satisfaction which the walkers felt to taste, thus dressed, the freshness of the evening.</p><p> </p><p> One hundred and ninety-seven dead, says the administration.</p><p> </p><p> - More than three hundred, send the settlers back.</p><p> </p><p> The truth is underground.</p><p> </p><p> Six o'clock ! we hook the gangway to the boat. The colonial officials feel anguish pinching their hearts. They do not know where they are going, in fact, these people. Are they for Dahomey, Guinea, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Togo, Upper Volta, Niger? Is their journey over? Do they still have ten, twenty or thirty days, by car, barge, tipoye? We are going to come and display their fate in the corridor.</p><p> </p><p> We display it. Here they are gathered around the signed sheet of paper: "Carde, Governor General. »Exclamations! Protests! Nose! We hear ill-bred words. A woman swears that she will not accompany her husband to Zinder. This lieutenant who had asked for Timbuktu and had shown us his meharist equipment, we are sending him to the Coast! Whoever planned to stay on the Coast will go to the Sahara. This couple who made ten years in the humid countries, around the lagoonsfrom Abidjan, is shipped to a dry country, in Ouagadougou!</p><p> </p><p> - I will die, says the husband, my wife too. Carde wants our skin, take it right away! Here it is, he said to the representative of the proconsul, bring it to him this evening. He will make shoes for his wife.</p><p> </p><p> The wife does not want to give her skin to make shoes for Mrs. Carde.</p><p> </p><p> - Take it! take them! continues to shout the man who does not like dry countries; after there will be our bones, it will be for his pooch!</p><p> </p><p> This is the fault of the hub .</p><p> </p><p> The turntable was invented by Mr. Carde.</p><p> </p><p> Formerly colonial officials did their time in the same colony. Today, the master forces them to waltz. They don't like this dance. Who says colonial official no longer means adventurous spirit. The career has been dangerously gentrified. No more enthusiasm at the start, romantic colonization, the risks sought, the hut in the bush, the conquest of the Negro soul, the little mousso! We are now embarking with his wife, children and stepmother. It's the colony in curlers!</p><p> </p><p> Disembark.</p><p> </p><p> - Hep! Hep! A carrier !</p><p> </p><p> - A carrier ? a companion answers me, youhave the madness of the aristocracy. Negroes don't wear in Senegal, sir, they vote.</p><p> </p><p> Going down the ladder, he murmured:</p><p> </p><p> - They vote! They vote! and soon they will dance the gavotte!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Farewell, Belle-Île! Go to Buenos-Aires to load your refrigerated meats. Farewell, Commander Rousselet, dear old wolf, if this is the Devil's country, we will see! And here I am near the bridge. I stop. We cannot cross it. A white and a black play there savate.</p><p> </p><p> - Ti strikes? says black. Ah! you strikes? Here it's not France, it's Senegal, do you understand? Senegal, my homeland, here at home, do you understand?</p><p> </p><p> The negro had been surprised looking closely at the interior of a cabin. The boy had driven him rather with his feet than with his hands.</p><p> </p><p> - Here, replies the boy, it's France, and if you go back up…, and he points to his shoe.</p><p> </p><p> - You, if you come down, lead me to the superintendent, you understand? Here Senegal, huh? not France!</p><p> </p><p> And he spits as if to drown at once the boy, the boat, all the whites and their Saint-Frusquin in an immensity of contempt.</p><p> </p><p> It's always dark when I land in this Negro country. It's still night this time. Leaning against the port gate, an old Ouolof smokes a pipe.</p><p> </p><p> - Good evening! I said.</p><p> </p><p> - Him! Him! she answers.</p><p> </p><p> It was the only salvation from ebony earth.</p><p> </p><p> And I went into the city.</p><p> </p><p> Here ! the new post is completed. It’s not a shame! The other was so disgusting that one dared not lick the stamps she was selling. But how dismal everything is! What? no more terraces in front of cafes, those good old terraces, images of the Fatherland, and which France preciously exports to all its colonies? What is going on ? The measures against yellow fever have not yet been lifted. Would stegomia always wear cheerfully? Where's my mosquito pump? I should have it in my hands and be preceded by a protective cloud. The Pump stayed with the merchant. If my mother knew that! It is true that these critters especially love pure and fresh blood. Gold…</p><p> </p><p> Dakar is nothing more than a huge cage. The restaurants are behind metal canvases. The people at the windows, imagining themselves taking the air, are also behind metal canvases. These two settlers drinking an aperitif bask in the center of a large pantry planted in a garden. A provident housewife had to shelter them from cats and flies, to cook them tomorrow morning! Amazed, I look at them; then they do:</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! you disembark?</p><p> </p><p> I resume my way.</p><p> </p><p> On the ground, I hear my footsteps knocking… knocking on the door of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> The Sudan train leaves every Tuesday. So the boats arrange to arrive on Wednesday!</p><p> </p><p> It's good. This immediately puts you in step.</p><p> </p><p> It is not recommended, in fact, to land in Africa spitting fire, the devil in the body and ants in the legs.</p><p> </p><p> This country does not like being clever at home. Otherwise he immediately sends you his gendarme. It's the sun.</p><p> </p><p> The sun appears. He hits your neck and tells you, "Do you want to go home and walk more slowly. "</p><p> </p><p> You can disobey him for the first time; Maybe he won't say anything, being well above us!</p><p> </p><p> But if you are incorrigible, if you disturb him too often, he will come with his stick, a big bamboo, and strike you with a resounding blow on the head. You will be well advanced!</p><p> </p><p> Six days had passed. The dark journey was beginning. I was going to hit the road, as the negroes say, which means to leave. It would be Senegal, Guinea, Sudan, Upper Volta, Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, Dahomey, Gabon, Congo. After Dakar, Timbuktu! I'm looking to throw you known names: Ouagadougou! The Bush ! the forest, the wood cutters, the seekers of gold, the installers of rails. Ah! the installers of rails! The great rivers that we never stop going up, the mud houses which are the largest factories of canned heat reported until this date. It would be a car, a barge, a railroad, a horse, a camel, a pirogue, a Decauville, a tipoye. The black empire of the Republic. His subjects, his masters. The unknown land of white-clothed and naked humans. It would be…</p><p> </p><p> Suddenly someone asked me:</p><p> </p><p> - Do you have dishes? furniture? How many cases?</p><p> </p><p> I was on the station platform in Dakar.</p><p> </p><p> - How many cases? Ten? Twenty? Thirty? Forty? I need to know for the number of vans.</p><p> </p><p> - Me, I said, I have a suitcase.</p><p> </p><p> - A suitcase ? Where are you going ?</p><p> </p><p> - All over !</p><p> </p><p> The white traffic clerk turned his back, shrugging his shoulders.</p><p> </p><p> So there are people traveling with forty cases? If there are and they are not decorated with the order of the railway, the Minister of Public Works is a big careless!</p><p> </p><p> The employee had told the truth.</p><p> </p><p> The travelers arrived with so many packages that all looked like wholesale grocers moving!</p><p> </p><p> Meat, vegetables, fish, fruit, everything that modern industry has been able to box. Lingerie, bedding, bed wood, it followed from France to get eaten in a bush post, food by the bushes, furniture by the termites.</p><p> </p><p> A beautiful black preceded me at the counter. A voter from Blaise. So his brothers call Mr. Diagne. The voter was wearing a so-called bowler hat and which must have served fifteen years, as an object of experiment, to these street street hawkers, sellers of detaching soap!</p><p> </p><p> "Give me a ticket," he said to the ticket clerk.</p><p> </p><p> - For where ?</p><p> </p><p> - Here ! give me for fifty francs.</p><p> </p><p> The peanut trade finished, the Senegalese have a little money; then they will go for a walk.</p><p> </p><p> They do not go to Thiès, Saint-Louis, or Kayes. They go up to fifty, eighty, one hundred francs, depending on their fortune. At the stops we see them at the door shouting: "Bonjou Mamadou! Bonjou, Galandou! Bonjou, Bakari! Bonjou, Gamba! They show themselves to their knowledge in the noble position of a traveler. They are proud. Then they come back - on foot!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The train started. He was going to run on twelve hundred kilometers of track. It joins the Atlantic to Niger. Then he stops. The roads or the river will do the rest. Twelve hundred kilometers! The greatest work we have done in black Africa. For the one who would not be ungrateful, to greet this path would not be a sufficient gesture, it would be necessary to take a case of immortals with you (when you have forty cases!…) And sow these dried flowers on the course. We would be sure, in this way, to honor, with each crossing, the memory of a negro fallen for civilization.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> One cannot say that Senegal resembles a botanical garden: it has only one tree. It's the baobab. The baobab is a desperate giant. He is a penguin and a tortoise. He stretches his stumps facing the sky, as if to appeal to the Creator for the wickedness of the executioners who crucified him. We feel that he would utter heartbreaking cries if hehad the floor and that he would make gestures of distress if nature had given him the gift of movement. He would complain about having such a quickdraw and arms like the legs of a cockatiel have legs!</p><p> </p><p> - Yes ! Yes ! look carefully ! That's all we have as shade. You remain open-mouthed. It will have to be closed. This landscape will not change for six hundred kilometers. Your jaw will tire in the long run. In a country where we would need shade, this is what we are given! But let me introduce myself: Jean Miette, public works manager, sixteen years of colony, plus a hair on my head, not a single season in Vichy. I was the most beautiful liver in Ivory Coast. It will not last. Carde wants my liver: it affects me in Sudan, where you never sweat. He decided the thing one morning, in his pastry palace. He said, "Miette won't sweat anymore! I am disciplined. I won't sweat anymore, that's all!</p><p> </p><p> He kept mopping up.</p><p> </p><p> - And my liver will become like a pebble, which will make two pebbles with the one I have under my helmet. Are you not thirsty</p><p> </p><p> We had passed Rufisque, Thiès, Bambey, Diourbel. At the stations, the natives shouted at the door of their special compartments. They knew everyone, they called everyone.</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou, Molobali!</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou, Suliman!</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou, Koukouli!</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou, Poincaré!</p><p> </p><p> There are a lot of Poincaré. There are Herriot, Kodak, Citroën, Painlevé, Urodonal, names that we see written in large letters on the newspapers of France!</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou, Samaritaine!</p><p> </p><p> The dioulas (hawkers) sell them cola nuts. Black eats kola nuts like we do bread. He feeds on it. It upset her heart. He dies. Here are twenty Senegalese who are about to participate in the great mystery of steam traction: who will take the train. They assault the wagon. It is an irresistible burden. Those who hold the places receive them, braced, and send them back to the quay with four shackles in the air. In anger, the vanquished throw their backpacks into the compartment. Travelers who are stunned do not move. The others swear by all the wizards. A dark pugilation comes out of there. A white man arrives and hits the pile. All is well if the one who receives the blows is not a voter. Otherwise, the big challenge scene begins:</p><p> </p><p> - Did you hit me? Ti m'as ansourté (insulted)?</p><p> </p><p> - Shut up!</p><p> </p><p> - My mouth is worth your mouth! Me French like you!</p><p> </p><p> And the voter is looking for witnesses.</p><p> </p><p> - Ti will pay twenty-five francs! let him shout at white. Twenty-five francs!</p><p> </p><p> - Come closer, return the white man, let me take it for fifty francs.</p><p> </p><p> A white who hits a black has a fine of twenty-five francs, but witnesses are needed.</p><p> </p><p> The train leaves. The black clings to the ramp of the step.</p><p> </p><p> - Ji will come back! Ti will be condemned! To rivoir (Goodbye)! Ah! ah! To be riveted!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> There is a young man on this train who is starting out in the colonial career. He does not feel confident on the land of Africa. His hometown would do much better. The vocation misses him. He shows everyone his photograph of his wife.</p><p> </p><p> - Now that's how we get them, says Mr. Miette. Either it drags the whole family behind or it cries on a photograph! Tuck in your piece of cardboard, my little guy! It's a bad fetish to start. You have to be weaned when you choose this career. You will not be able to take the metro to dine atmom this evening or buy the third edition of the Intran , it is understood, but it will be as much savings!</p><p> </p><p> There is Father Levreau, an old bushman. Twenty-one years from Sudan. He returned from France for the second time only. He only likes Kayes.</p><p> </p><p> - Besides, he explains, Kayes is one of the three hottest cities in the world. Podor, Djibouti and Kayes, it is well known, we must not get out of there. Wherever I go I will fall.</p><p> </p><p> The next day at noon - in the hottest city in the world, the train arrives at noon! - Father Levreau disembarked at Kayes.</p><p> </p><p> His six wives were waiting for him on the quay, six black women, including two Moorish women with big camel eyes.</p><p> </p><p> - Hello, darling! he said. Hello ! Hello !</p><p> </p><p> They rushed into his arms.</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou, papa! they replied! Ah! dad ! Bonjou!</p><p> </p><p> Servants and maids behind them clapped their hands. He was dashing, chirping.</p><p> </p><p> Inside the station, the thermometer read forty-six!</p><p> </p><p> Twenty million blacks, French subjects.</p><p> </p><p> Two empires.</p><p> </p><p> French West Africa: A. O. F.</p><p> </p><p> French Equatorial Africa: A. E. F.</p><p> </p><p> Aof! and the Aef!</p><p> </p><p> Thirteen million subjects in Aof. Four million in Aef.</p><p> </p><p> Togo and Cameroon do the rest.</p><p> </p><p> The Germans lost these two lands during the war. By chance, rather than by modesty, the English did not win them.</p><p> </p><p> So they came back to us.</p><p> </p><p> Eight colonies in Aof: Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Upper Volta, Sudan, Niger.</p><p> </p><p> Four in Aef: Gabon, Middle Congo, Oubangui-Chari, Chad.</p><p> </p><p> The Aof goes from the Atlantic to Lake Chad for the width, and from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea for the height. It is a territory of five million square kilometers.</p><p> </p><p> The Aef begins at the equator and ends at the black devil, eating the heart of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> There is something to walk around!</p><p> </p><p> Historians say that the country is in the form of a trough. The word cauldron would suit him better.</p><p> </p><p> We're cooking it up. We are on the gas like a piece of roast walnut in its stew. The devil can come and test you from the end of his fork, you can never be cooked enough! We cook during the day, we cook at night. Leaving from there, we can always put ourselves in a meat press, it is not the blood that we will return that will strengthen the anemic!</p><p> </p><p> What are we complaining about? Africa takes no one by force. No siren on his ribs calls you. No natural harbors and the bar pushes you away. The boaters may sing:</p><p> </p><p> We are the strong boys</p><p> The masters of the bar,</p><p> Let’s go, go on…</p><p> </p><p> The canoe recedes.</p><p> </p><p> Let's make our arms go</p><p> We will have it, we will have it,</p><p> Help our fetishes!</p><p> </p><p> Ah! the bar doesn't care! It hunts men who want to land. If they insist, she knocks them down. Thus stands Africa on the threshold of its door to receive its visitors.</p><p> </p><p> We left Senegal, colony at the polls, kingdom of Blaise, the ten thousand citizens of the four communes of full exercise, exercise of conjuring, boxing and savate! Here are the blacks, the real, the pure, not the children of universal suffrage, but those of the old Cham. How nice they are! They come running from their bush to say Bonjou! They wave their arms with such sincerity, a smile varnishes their faces so well that it is as if we are pleased to see them. They look at you as if in time they were dogs to which you would have given sugar. Among them, we feel like a kind of good Lord on a stroll.</p><p> </p><p> Their villages are not on top of each other. They appear sparse in the great continent. Small heaps here and there, with hundreds of kilometers between here and there! Black is a people that no longer grows.</p><p> </p><p> Men and women stand naked with infinite modesty. Women, sometimes, cross their arms over their chest when you meet them, but they are the old women!</p><p> </p><p> They go their "foot the way". Where are they goingstill running? Far. Very far. A week's trip is just a very ordinary affair for them.</p><p> </p><p> They walk like we breathe.</p><p> </p><p> Men walk, women walk, children walk, with a courageous leg, a heart without detour. All Africa walks at dawn: Dioulas (hawkers) who come down from the Timbuktu salt and who come up with kola nuts from the Gold Coast . Naive people who cross Sudan from start to finish for a heritage case, a woman's business, but above all a business of nothing at all. Village that goes on the feet of its males, their wives and offspring, bring the cotton to the commander. On the move for two days, the village will stop tomorrow morning. Those whose cotton is not well sorted will go to the box. They all walk, their thirty-kilo bag on their heads, never growling or thinking of anything wrong.</p><p> </p><p> Here are seven prisoners, in single file, tied by a rope that holds them by the neck. These seven heads appear to be seven large knots made from this rope. I will know later that a tirailleur accompanies them, much later, the tirailleur being five kilometers ahead! They follow !</p><p> </p><p> Further on, a militiaman, his wife, his child. The militiaman precedes, carrying only his rifle.The child is dressed in a European jacket, the jacket being careful not to descend to the place of propriety. The woman closes the procession. Like a loincloth a bundle of leaves. She's the moving car. A scaffolding is balanced on its head: three calabashes, smoked fish whose tails stick out, an empty bottle, two benches, six cassava rations, all crowned with marital chechia. In the back, held by an old calico, in the place where we put the black babies, a very small cat, which meows, turned towards the country that the family abandons.</p><p> </p><p> Here is the bearer of dispatches, naked and serious. In his hand, he holds a piece of wood. At the end of this stick, the dispatch is inserted into a slot. He would not wear the Blessed Sacrament more carefully. If he goes far? A hundred kilometers away ... Under the noses of the Europeans he meets, he puts his little stick. White people read the address and do not nod. He will find the recipient. After? He will come back.</p><p> </p><p> We are on the big road that leads to Niger. It is frequented. Why these long journeys? For everything and for nothing! At that big one, we stole his cow; he will tell his misfortune to the commander. Three days on the road. The commander will give him a piece of paper with the stamp . hewill return to his village. Then the robber will resume the road in the company of the thief, both walking one behind the other, without bitterness, towards the justice of the whites.</p><p> </p><p> These are emigrants. The land with them was exhausted. They are going to a new land. When they arrive, they will make a sacrifice, begging her to accept them. If the slaughtered chicken drops its legs in the air, the ground will have answered: no. They will walk again.</p><p> </p><p> Without a penny, the boubou on the back, the empty calabash on the head, cheerful (when the negro is sad, he dies), they cross Africa as we pass from one sidewalk to another. When evening comes, they sit in a village. Nobody knows them. What does it matter! They will enter a hut and greet the occupants.</p><p> </p><p> - Is Ti okay? Me, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> They will be given food like a visiting relative.</p><p> </p><p> No black poor. They practice real communism. The man who refuses couscous would be dishonored. None have ever fallen from starvation. When they starve, it's in droves, all in chorus and in the same famine.</p><p> </p><p> For them, money is worthless. The word economy is unknown to their dialects. Our the formula "make a fortune" is meaningless here. Does it exceed them? Do they exceed it? They used to work only for food. Now they are also working to pay the tax. Occasionally they even pay it twice instead of once. Small scandals of a vast land!…</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Tonight, I will not reach Bamako. Kita will be the stopover: big center, five whites, ten thousand blacks! It is the city of griots and morello cherries, of those who sing the praises of their contemporaries. A griot was right under the fetish tree. He spoke loudly, addressing a great devil who stood five paces from him. All around, two hundred people formed the circle.</p><p> </p><p> - What's he saying ? I asked the interpreter.</p><p> </p><p> - He says the glory of that negro.</p><p> </p><p> - What did he do then?</p><p> </p><p> - He gave money to the griot, so the griot proclaims his merits in the public square.</p><p> </p><p> The hero stood upright and proudly.</p><p> </p><p> The interpreter listened. Then he translated me:</p><p> </p><p> "His client must have been a skirmisher," he said. "He praises his corporal stripes. He said to him: "You have conquered, you have crossed the seas and the mountains. When you brandished your cup-cutter, the big white cannons that make poum and poum fled at full speed. You crossed Ferance (France), flowers with your gun. The great French fighter has shook your strong hand. You are young, beautiful and powerful. Your fiancée is pure like a little cow. Your father is the greatest hunter of the Bambara breed. Your mother was a virgin when she knew your father. Your box is clean and pretty. Your children will speak and walk faster than everyone else's. Your women will sit around you and look at you faithfully. You will always have food in your stomach. You are tall, Mamadou, tall as the tree in the village. "</p><p> </p><p> - How much does he pay for all this? I asked.</p><p> </p><p> "He will tell us," said the interpreter.</p><p> </p><p> And we advanced.</p><p> </p><p> - How much you give to the griot?</p><p> </p><p> - Me helmet forty francs.</p><p> </p><p> - So you have no more money now?</p><p> </p><p> He answered :</p><p> </p><p> - Me more money, but a lot of honor!</p><p> </p><p> - Your father is fine ?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Is your mother okay?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Is your child okay?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Is your chicken okay?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Is your dog fine?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Is your wife okay?</p><p> </p><p> This greeting had lasted a minute.</p><p> </p><p> This negro, meeting this negro, asked him for news of everything he had: his lougan (his field), his horse, his canoe. The woman came last.</p><p> </p><p> I was in Bamako, capital of Sudan, sitting among the natives, on one of the steps of the market, to the great amazement of the European people. The whites who were passing looked at me as if I had been a train!… They did not hide from me that I was losing face in mixing my beautiful individual with the Sudanese people in this way. The natives did not care!</p><p> </p><p> Behind their sewing machine, the males used to make boubous(loose-fitting linen clothing holding on to the shirt what they do not take from the chasuble); the women were squatting in front of the little heaps of things they had to sell: three pieces of sugar, four bananas, six cola nuts, a calabash of milk, five or six thousand flies ... little black balls like goat droppings , other balls, these whitish and from which rose a smell which is that of all Africa. It was the smell of shea butter. No lost well, no mouth, either sewer, or sink, will give you an idea of ​​that smell. However smoky you may be, you will fall inanimate at the slightest wave of shea butter. It is a smell that one could call hook, because it plunges in you and unhooks your heart!</p><p> </p><p> This vegetable butter goes well with all sauces. It is used in the kitchen, in the toilet. It greases dishes, lubricates skins. The more the skin shines in the sun, the more attractive the lady is. The misfortune isthat the coquette feels as far as it shines. I often dreamed of being followed by a tub of water and an energetic scrubber, and as soon as I saw a beauty grabbing it with a lasso, then immersing it in the liquid and making it stopper with conviction.</p><p> </p><p> Well ! elegant ladies of Europe and America, know that you make daily use of shea butter. It is, oh delicate! the basis of your creams of eternal beauty!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Ah! the pretty relationships that whites have commercially with blacks! We send them an unsuspected junk even for the regulars of the old two-penny shops. This is officially called trading goods!</p><p> </p><p> It is to believe that when our old hats, our shoes not resembled, our exhilarating clothes received for five years rain and dust on the tiles of the Temple, they leave for Sudan. Here they are at the Bamako market. Carefully stored on the stands, they constitute a hilarious collection. Here, fourteen soft or hard galurins. Five no longer have an edge. A merchant negro one of them. Twelve francs! He tries it. It is an old melon. He splits the feltin the middle, he looks at himself, looks beautiful! He pays.</p><p> </p><p> This pair of shoes consists of a shoe that was black and another that was yellow. It’s nothing. This pair seems odd to me! I examine it closely. The black croquenot is forty, the yellow forty-three!</p><p> </p><p> - How ?</p><p> </p><p> - Thirty francs!</p><p> </p><p> The English governor of the Gold Coast recently prohibited the entry of bundles of old tuxedos into his colony. Lords and gentlemen, this is where your evening wear ended! You had to have a recalcitrant spleen so as not to choke on laughter when walking around Accra. But not everyone laughed in England. It is said that a great tailor in London, supplier to His Majesty, almost committed suicide when he learned that his claw was walking on the back of colored  !</p><p> </p><p> We haven't banned anything yet. Here is my grandfather's sniff . I recognize it. He wore it the day of my mother's first communion! It ends with a whistle cut that cuts you off! Thirty-two francs! I buy it for my boy. He kisses my hands. What had I just done there? I hadn't noticed that my boy was without pants. It was not seennot when he was naked! Now he looks like a penguin mounted on stilts and who has forgotten his breastplate! The officials blame me for walking him in this outfit.</p><p> </p><p> - Buy him a boubou , advises the governor's chief of staff.</p><p> </p><p> - I buy what you allow to be sold to them.</p><p> </p><p> - So why don't you also offer him a cuirassier's helmet?</p><p> </p><p> It was an idea! There was one at the market. Unfortunately, the boy did not find the ponytail sufficiently supplied ...</p><p> </p><p> Where does what we sell to the poor negroes come from? Scissors whose branches do not touch; knives that do not cut; mirrors that do not reflect; non-foaming soaps; perfumes !!! ; combs without teeth; candles without cotton… and we could go so far as to say flutes without holes! Where are these sneaky factories that work badly because it's good enough for a whole part of the earth?</p><p> </p><p> Milking goods…</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> They are more than twenty thousand Sudanese in Bamako. France built a big city therenative, city in banko, that is to say in mud. No box exceeds the other. It stretches like a cemetery where only the poor have been buried; an egalitarian cemetery in the military zone. Above the walls surrounding these huts, we see the symbolic instrument of the whole of Africa rise and descend in rhythm: the long stick to pound millet. It seems like the slightly tilted piston of a machine always in motion, the antediluvian machine which gives food to the cursed race.</p><p> </p><p> Why didn't we install mills that would crush millet, husk rice? The male does not want, neither does the mother-in-law. "I pounded all my life, why wouldn't the girl do the same?" Said the old creature. As for the husband's opinion, here it is:</p><p> </p><p> At Gao, a captain had built a mill with three beautiful pestles that worked hard. He summoned the notables, explained the miracle to them. Wonder! However, the village chief stepped forward and said, "Now what will our women do? "</p><p> </p><p> The condemnation of progress was unanswerable.</p><p> </p><p> Women pound in Bamako.</p><p> </p><p> Twenty thousand blacks living there, at ground level, and only the dull sound of sticks smashing wooden mortars. It's the afternoon. The men are not in the city. They are boys among the whites or they complete their days of work, digging the Sotuba canal, on the other side of Niger, or repairing roads. Either they are busy babywearing, or even, as great connoisseurs, they scratch their toes, voluptuously sprawled on the warm earth of their homeland.</p><p> </p><p> I'm walking in the black city. A single cry rises from the silence. It is that of the small kola nut merchant.</p><p> </p><p> - Ayé na vo san! she says.</p><p> </p><p> I ask her what her name is. She answers nothing. I give him ten sous. So she said, "Aïsata. I hand him another coin. She hesitates to take it, because she only has one name, she says!…</p><p> </p><p> This time, there is a lot of noise: a big palaver with bursts of voice. A rifleman leads a devil train in the courtyard of a hut. He speaks like a general angry at the front of his troops. Its apostrophe is a mixture of Bambara and French words. French words without a doubt, but words that are not used in salons. Those who taught him our language did not steal his money from him. It would be nothing to say that he was the pupil of our last coachmancab. Ah! evil polite! He was coming to get one of his fellow citizens to take him to the captain. The fellow citizen did not want to follow him. Then, suddenly, he applied a pair of slaps to her, ten feet away I felt the wind. The other did not jump on him. He did not even move. The negro receives slaps as if it were due to him! His two wives continued to pound millet, his dog to die.</p><p> </p><p> - Service-service! shouted the sharpshooter.</p><p> </p><p> As soon as black represents authority, he is fierce for his brothers. He strikes them, ransacks their hut, eats their millet, swallows their bangui, demands their daughters. The chéchia has beautiful virtues on the edges of Niger!</p><p> </p><p> Night was falling. I headed for the Sudan-Club . I was thirsty. I understood why we had invented colonial glasses! The taste buds are still in distress in this country.</p><p> </p><p> - Do you know what Bamako means? asked me a white man once I was installed and without whom I would not have drunk, because whoever is not from the Sudan-Club has just the right to die of thirst; that means the caiman affair.</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! I said, my nose already at the bottom of my glass.</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, the fetish of Bamako is the caiman. It protects the city. As he rendered many services, the notables, before our arrival, gave him, each year, a young virgin girl to eat. It was a big party.</p><p> </p><p> - And today ? We don't give him any more?</p><p> </p><p> - Officially no!</p><p> </p><p> We asked again to drink.</p><p> </p><p> - Hey! Hello ! mister new! I'm Tartass. You cannot go to the governor before going through my hands. Look at them, touch them. They are expert and gentle. No chaps, maybe a little wide, but I worked so hard! And the nails so clean! I'm Tartass. A little clipper blow on the neck, a light walk of my scissors around your ears, that changes a man and makes you pleasant to contemplate. I'm telling you, I'm a guy. We will not see two like me in Sudan. Mr. Armand Fallières, my country, knows this well. I wrote it to him. I'm from Mézin. Tartass and Fallières were born in Mézin. We make corks there, big ones for the decanters, means for the bottles, small ones for the bottles. Everything that comes from Mézin floats. Ah! I am happy ! happy !</p><p> </p><p> I have a noggin, me, you know, and what a will! Maybe not educated. Not as planedthan others, I agree, but a wire crosses my body vertically. I pushed around a wire. Ah! I impressed some of them. I want. I want. I wanted. This is my secret. Nothing is inaccessible to Tartass. And I love the world, my fellow man. I am good, understanding, but do not think that I am disorderly or spendthrift. The one who will unbutton my tunic has not yet been born. You can see my wallet pointing to the breast, but no one dares to touch it. The whole colony now looks at him with respect. We wink an envious eye on my side. That flatters me. Ah! I am happy ! very happy !</p><p> </p><p> I am very popular. But we don't yet know Tartass. We welcome it all the way from Kayes to Bamako. But what we salute is above all its external appearance, its reputation, its past, its present, its future. Man, his deep personality, escapes my contemporaries. They suspect something well, they see it badly. I sin by knowledge, I recognize it, but I have substance. And what is needed here at the colony is from the bottom, still from the bottom, always from the bottom. To fully understand the value that I am, measure the distance from the zero that I was in the superb situation that is mine today. Go for a walk and ask to see my houses. There are five of them. All wonpenny to penny, beard to beard, hair to hair, hair to hair! Ah! I'm happy, very happy! I am living proof that the Frenchman who comes to the colony, who eats little, does not drink, does not nap, that this Frenchman prospers, enriches himself and ends up being a superman. Only this is not a reason to look good. No pride especially, no pride! Cash gives you strength, but focus it. Do not be generous, conceited, or luxurious. All inside! Nothing for the gallery!</p><p> </p><p> - Finally ! I said to him, what do you want with me?</p><p> </p><p> - I'm Tartass. You have before you a millionaire hairdresser. I do not know with whom I am dealing, but I have used heads: Marshal Pétain, Colonel de Goys, the Duke of Aosta, Pelletier Doisy. A good boy. He didn't want to leave without having coffee with me. In Paris, nineteen years ago, I cut my hair at Mr. Aristide Briand, 31, rue de Dunkerque. Ah! if he knew the situation I have been in, ever since! Rue des Beaux-Arts, I shaved Mr. Marcel Hutin. He still smoked big cigars. He would smoke much better if he had followed my example! But not everyone is Tartass! Without me, what would you see in Sudan? Uncultivated beards, red-skinned hair and, among the cleanest, stairs in the hairstyle. This would have had a great effect on the Company's envoysdes Nations, last year, when these gentlemen passed by here. They would have taken a rich idea of ​​the figure of France on the banks of the Niger! Tartass was there. Everything was saved. I'm happy, very happy!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> He was a mastoc man, short on legs, strong in calves, with a figure like a mare's behind. He had horse pants, but no gaiters, an officer's coat; moreover, at three o'clock in the afternoon, he arrived at the Bamako buffet without glasses, without a helmet and on a bicycle! Now I remembered. The man had been reported to me.</p><p> </p><p> - Are you going to Sudan? So, will you see Tartass? Even on the boat, Tartass was famous.</p><p> </p><p> - There are hairdresser and hairdresser. We already knew the city hairstylist and the country hairstylist. I invented the colonial hairdresser! What is that ? A man who digests well, who knows where the fever comes from, who watches and kills it and who is satisfied with the climate. I don't have a shop. I am the bicycle hairdresser, in other words the pedal hairdresser. They phone me, a voice says: Tartass, go up to Koulouba to trim the hair of the governor. " In the saddle ! In the saddle ! Five kilometers of coast. Tartass arrives at Koulouba. I do not pretend that the colony could do without governor, in any case no governor could do without Tartass. Ah! I am happy ! happy ! Do not be afraid of distances, this is the secret of success. I'm going to operate in Kayes, five hundred kilometers from my home. Yes sir, Tartass does that. On the outward and return journey, he cuts and shaves on the train. Did you know that Tartass is the concern of all the bushmen from Timbuktu to Dakar? Two months before, they say to themselves: "As long as Tartass is on the train!" He is there, clipper in hand, chisel slung, razor between the teeth. From station to station, from compartment to compartment, along the whole line, its name flies. It flies like an evening butterfly, full of hope. Bearded men will be hairless and shaggy transfigured.</p><p> </p><p> - So, are you happy?</p><p> </p><p> - Am I happy? It's okay ! It's okay ! I tell you. Ah! I did well to be cuckold, I did well! Without this incident, what would Tartass be today? A small rind scraper in a Parisian living room. I would spend my day saying, "First of these gentlemen! This took place nineteen years ago, rue Mazagran, near the Grands Boulevards. I had a shop; notice that already Tartass was enterprising - already! I was coming back from putting a hairpiece to a client fromneighborhood, I find my wife in the ladies' lounge on my clerk's lap. What did Tartass do, Tartass who worshiped his wife? He went into exile. He took the boat. He put the sea between the object of his pain and him. I arrived in Dakar. I accepted a modest place on the railway. One day the manager called me up and said, "Tartass, you're a moron, I'm going to kick you out. He was giving me back my badger! You remembered well, a man, in his aberration, said to Tartass: "Tartass, you are a moron!" What is Tartass? A millionaire, sir, a millionaire and well regarded, and his health intact, sane of mind and body, five houses in the sun!</p><p> </p><p> - Obviously, they cannot be in the shade in this country!</p><p> </p><p> - Happy with the accomplished task, proud of the future that is coming. It's okay ! It's okay ! Tartass is the one telling you. I am happy ! very happy !</p><p> </p><p> - So you want to cut my hair?</p><p> </p><p> - Only!</p><p> </p><p> I took her to my room.</p><p> </p><p> - Now that you know Tartass, he continued, you can learn the news: I'm running for election. I am seeking the post of colonial delegate from Sudan and Upper Volta to the superior council of the colonies. Mostsenior personalities of Bamako form my committee. They were the ones who came to me and said, "Tartass, we need a flag. So I deployed. I am running against this brave member for Indre-et-Loire, Mr. Proust. He came here by plane. Well ! nobody raised his head to look at him, nobody except me, but me it was to say to him: "Here is your adversary, measure it well. I got a sunburn on my nose! I will be elected. I have eyes, ears, smell. Tartass sees, hears, smells. I also have…</p><p> </p><p> He was passing my mower around my neck. He stopped mowing and talking. As the silence continued, I turned around. He stuck out his tongue and pointed to it with his finger.</p><p> </p><p> - You are thirsty ? I said.</p><p> </p><p> - No, he said, stopping his demonstration, but I also have a language, I have the speaker's language! I am very happy!</p><p> </p><p> He noticed my own bottle of cologne, grabbed it and rubbed it on me.</p><p> </p><p> - A friction of five francs or ten francs? he asked me.</p><p> </p><p> I pointed out to him that this water belonged to me.</p><p> </p><p> - Today is hot, he said, I'll put you for ten francs.</p><p> </p><p> I learned later that he still operated like this.</p><p> </p><p> - Millionaire, politician, defender of whites and blacks, because the native, it's Tartass who tells you, is even less villainous than us, this is how, after nineteen years of exile, I will present myself soon to the city of Paris.</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! goodbye, I said.</p><p> </p><p> He resumed his bike.</p><p> </p><p> - I will be elected, that's not much, it's Tartass who tells you. It's okay ! It's okay ! I am happy ! very happy !</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "Tartass did not lie to you," said the notables of Bamako that same evening. He is indeed a millionaire, and we present him for the election of delegate. Alas! we do not have great hope. The colony no longer understands the joke. Formerly it would have passed triumphantly, but formerly we had spirit and we knew how to have fun. Finally, let's wait! Couldn't you help us in this little fantasy?</p><p> </p><p> The next day, I left Bamako. I was going to run Sudan and Upper Volta. You could see behind my car a large white calico.</p><p> </p><p> It was written on it:</p><p> </p><p> VOTE ALL FOR TARTASS!</p><p> IT'S OKAY ! IT'S OKAY !</p><p> I AM HAPPY ! VERY HAPPY !</p><p> </p><p> Blacks of both sexes worked on the road. Folded in half as if they were waiting for the partner to play leapfrog, they tapped it with a batten. It was two rows, one for men, one for women, old and ugly women, shriveled skin on the skeleton. Obviously, they could no longer be used ... except on the road.</p><p> </p><p> On the edge of the road, an orchestra: three tambourines and a flautiau. To give rhythm to the road workers, the musicians chanted an air which went up and down in four times, on four sounds, from dawn to bedtime. A peaceful dog would have become enraged!</p><p> </p><p> Another team came and went, stones on their heads, some carrying only one, others three or four, in a small basket, a basket for a dozen eggs!</p><p> </p><p> From the construction site to the pile of stones, five hundred meters. Each stone, each basket represented a kilometer of walking. You will assure me that in our time there are steam rollers, automobile trucks, even old dumpers. I will answer you, from here, that you dreamed! In any case, if you know of any in the hangars of the colonial administration, say so, I will run there!</p><p> </p><p> A plane sometimes passes over black Africa; that is understandable, it is a machine that goes fast. While a steam roller! Everyone has seen it. Nothing moves more slowly. I was told that one of these instruments was on its way. He would have left France twenty-eight years ago! Have confidence! He will come !</p><p> </p><p> However, push him a little, if you meet him, the negroes will bless you!</p><p> </p><p> We tried the wheelbarrow, it must be recognized. The wheelbarrow dating from Pascal had had time to make the trip. Alas! whether Mandingo, Peuhl, Bambara, Sonraï, Mossi, Gourmantché, Berba, Toucouleur, the son of darkness never knew how to use the wheel. The wheelbarrow was tipping over. He stumbled into it. So he would lift it up and put it on his head! We stopped there.</p><p> </p><p> Three tambourines, a flute.</p><p> </p><p> When the music stops, the tapers stop.</p><p> </p><p> The capita [1] starts everything off with his manigolo [2] .</p><p> </p><p> They are the captives!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Hey! Yes ! captives!</p><p> </p><p> Slavery in Africa is only abolished in European ministerial declarations.</p><p> </p><p> England, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Portugal send their representatives to the gallery of their Chamber. They say, "Slavery is done, our laws prove it." "</p><p> </p><p> Officially, yes.</p><p> </p><p> Actually no !</p><p> </p><p> Remember! About eight months ago, a dispatch from London announced in French newspapers that in Sierra Leone England had just released 230,000 captives.</p><p> </p><p> So there were?</p><p> </p><p> There are always, including these two hundred and thirty thousand! There is even only that! They are called: captive huts. This term is not an expression, a vestige of the past; it indicates a reality. In native language, they respond to the name of ouoloso which means: to be born in the hut. They are the property of the chef, just like the cows andother animals. The chief shelters them, feeds them. He gives them a wife or two. The couples will thus make small ouolosos.</p><p> </p><p> In the past, they were trafficked. When the nations of Europe suppressed the slave trade (officially), did they suppress the slaves at the same time? The slaves stayed where they were, that is, with their buyers. They simply changed their names: from trapped captives they became captive huts; they are born Ga-Bibi , as the little ones are called serfs. They are the negroes of the negroes. Masters no longer have the right to sell them. They exchange them. Above all, they make them make sons. The slave is no longer bought, it reproduces. It's the incubator at home!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> France tried to find a solution. Around 1910, she founded freedom villages in Sudan. Our envoys roamed the bush, recruiting, this time, not for the army, but for the principle. We brought game from these democratic tours. We park it in our villages. You can imagine how much the negroes had fun contemplating the bust of the Republic! They were given seeds; they ate them instead of sowing them. Those who managed to live, in turn, only wanted to have captives. The former chiefs were not happy. Theyhad bought their wives, they were coming to take them back. In short, they rediscovered the herd and suddenly, in the name of the local gods, they instilled in the ungrateful, in a few crazy, the horror of change and respect for traditions.</p><p> </p><p> France did better: it posted sentries around the villages of freedom to prevent the liberated from returning to slavery! She did not go further!</p><p> </p><p> We still meet some of these paradises. They look like termite mound fields. The huts have become heaps of mud. In one of them, near Kita, in Dyambouroubourou, there was only one old man ... The child of freedom was bent like the charcoal burner when he reached the sixth floor, his fifty kilos on his back ! ...</p><p> </p><p> Africa is still captive. For a free man it is fifteen ouolosos. In negro life, these ouolosos are not highly unhappy. They go get the water, they cultivate the lougan, and when the owner no longer knows how to use it, he says to everyone: "Go away for six months, make do as long as you bring me your tax." In principle, they work four days for the master; the other three days, they stretch, scratch their feet, caress their stomachs. But these are only details; we let's get out of the case. The important thing begins when white appears.</p><p> </p><p> Who says white says, here, administration. The administration is the negro mosquito. At all times in her life, she stings him, disturbing her idleness. He, who slept so well!</p><p> </p><p> - Dibout! Dibout (standing)! Fifty men for my commander!</p><p> </p><p> It is the militiaman who appears.</p><p> </p><p> You have to raise a bridge, retype a road, etc.</p><p> </p><p> The chief is not going to give his children or his sons-in-law. He gives up the captives.</p><p> </p><p> - Sauvazes! shouts the rifleman, who is as Negro as they are. On the way, run! Chicotte!</p><p> </p><p> This is called benefits.</p><p> </p><p> Each black person, apart from tax, owes seven to fifteen days of benefits per year.</p><p> </p><p> It is the captives who make them.</p><p> </p><p> In the name of white law, everyone owes only their fortnight; in the name of black custom, the captive owes fifteen plus fifteen plus fifteen… everything that the others do not do!</p><p> </p><p> So everyone is happy. White law is human and African customs are respected!</p><p> </p><p> It is the captive that we recruit for the army. And during the war it was sometimes his master who, in lieu of parents, received the allowance!</p><p> </p><p> The companies of workers are the captive. There he has it for two years. It is he who digs the Sotuba canal. He who did and he who makes the railways of Senegal, Sudan, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Togo, Dahomey. From the Congo! We will arrive in Congo, be patient; we will be hot, but it will not be for nothing!</p><p> </p><p> The money he receives is given to his chief. It is the captive who opens the roads and repairs them. It was he who carried me, as well as my boxes of canned goods and my suitcase. My poor dear old pigskin suitcase, did you look pretty, bewildered on Mamadou's head, through the big forest!</p><p> </p><p> It is the captive who, for days, roams the savannah, thirty kilos of cassava in charge, followed by his wives and children, lamentable kyrielle to supply the building sites of civilization!</p><p> </p><p> A truck would do a much better job. But gasoline comes at crazy prices, while there are a lot of banana trees. He's the banana engine!</p><p> </p><p> When there are no more men in the villages and that more is still needed, the chiefs dispatch the old ouolosos and the young Ga-Dibi .</p><p> </p><p> After the old men and the children, they send the women, not the young captives, but the old ones, the parched ones, those whose skin, for a long time, is no longer ironed.</p><p> </p><p> Everything is useful in Africa!</p><p> </p><p> Sudan!</p><p> </p><p> In this bush, you suddenly have a thought. The landscape, the natives, that disappears for a moment from your eyes. A screen comes between you and this reality. And on the screen, we see:</p><p> </p><p> The conquest !</p><p> </p><p> The shakos! the neck covers! the soldiers of France!</p><p> </p><p> Crushed, between this drilling sun and this burning earth, the conquering column advanced ...</p><p> </p><p> This route ? She traced it. The picks were hitting, the shovels were clearing, sweat was running. Under forty degrees the skin was chapped, the lips cut as if by the cold. The Harmatan, the wind from Sudan, blew and dried the dew on the mucous membranes.</p><p> </p><p> We remember that in the illustrious Kayes, you were told: "Here! this is Archinard's room ”. It was a hutch. That at Kita, you were shown a chicken coop: "Here! it's the abodefrom Joffre! "Your black driver, stopping right outside a village, said to you yesterday:" Here! rigarde: Gaïeni (Gallieni) two years the box in tata of Ahmadou. »Two years prisoner of Ahmadou, son of Omar! Seven hundred days filing his bars in this field of termite mounds, because, before him in this country, only termites had worked! It has been noted exactly that once in Kabara it would be necessary to stop, walking on Timbuktu, to see the place where, near the rag tree, Gouraud received his first prune.</p><p> </p><p> Sometimes a truncated pyramid in the bush. We are approaching. We read: "French colonial memory to Captain Gallieni, to lieutenants Vallière and Pietri, to doctors Tantam and Bayol".</p><p> </p><p> Then, it is a tomb all by itself:</p><p> </p><p> Ge.rges G.iva..r</p><p> li..t to Sudanese sp.his</p><p> killed to enemy.</p><p> 28 years old.</p><p> </p><p> These are cemeteries, on which we have planted weeping trees, dioubalés:</p><p> </p><p> Pelabon, lieut. 5 th Engineering</p><p> death Bafoulabé, 28.</p><p> </p><p> On this stone, everything is erased except: 26 years.</p><p> </p><p> Lagarde Jean</p><p> lieut. art. Navy</p><p> killed on ... 27 years old.</p><p> </p><p> Géta, Jean-Noël, 27 years old. Durani, 29 years old.</p><p> </p><p> A stele: "We, of whom he was the comrade in arms, give him a thought". The name is no longer there, there is only age: 25 years. Thousands hung on the branches of the dioubalés, the bats cover these slabs with filthy snow, constantly renewed.</p><p> </p><p> It was between 1880 and 1900. Our columns…</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> At that time, Ahmadou, Habibou, Moktar and Mountaga shared the empire of El Hadj Omar, their father. Such were called the pretty sons of the Emperor Toucouleur. Ahmadou killed Habibou, killed Moktar. As for Mountaga, he blew himself up as soon as he saw Ahmadou approaching his aunt.</p><p> </p><p> Ahmadou reigned. It was pretty! Wow! say the old negroes who remember; he was taking dad, mom, moussos ...</p><p> </p><p> - He ate everything?</p><p> </p><p> - Ate a little there! [1] .</p><p> </p><p> On a territory larger than France, Ahmadou was the bandit. It was the hunt for cabaches. The Ségou region had become a large bowling alley. The heads rolled all year round like balls on the day of a competition. He was the greatest bowler of his time!</p><p> </p><p> We were much lower, fishing in the Senegal river. These heads had just finished rolling between our legs. When falling into the water, they scared the fish. The situation was becoming intolerable! We left the lines, we took the rifle.</p><p> </p><p> The governor of Senegal was Brière de l'Isle. "Not so fast," he said to the fishing soldiers. Put down your guns, I'm going to send someone to Mr. Ahmadou, who will say two words to him. He sent Paul Soleillet to her. Ahmadou was a gentleman. He offered bangui to our ambassador. The ambassador the goal. But he offered her meat! Distrustful, the ambassador refused. The conversation was broken off. M. Soleillet returned.</p><p> </p><p> The heads continued to roll.</p><p> </p><p> Although some of these little worms are well known to fish, the fishermen got angry. And this time, Brière de l'Isle said, "I'm going to send Captain Gallieni to him." He will speak drier. Gallieni left. Ahmadou immobilized him in an aunt! It was not that there was much fear for our envoy; illustratedMarshal, it will be remembered, has always been rather thin. However!</p><p> </p><p> We changed procedures.</p><p> </p><p> Borgnis-Desbordes installed his P.C. in Medina.</p><p> </p><p> Archinard arrived.</p><p> </p><p> The conquest ! the shakos! the neck covers! the column !…</p><p> </p><p> The sun, this cannibal, no longer stood for joy! He ate white flesh! He ate it up to pop his collar! The porpoises passed there, with their clothes and their stripes. He digested everything. Those who escaped him advanced. Ahmadou retreated and changed region. We followed him. They drove him from Ségou, from Nioro. Then from San, then from Dienné, then from Mopti. He went to hide in the cliffs of Bandiagara. They made him go down. It took thirteen years to have it. This day arrived. The Toucouleur empire had lived.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> But there was also the Mandingo Empire! Samori! Another beautiful bird, this one! Tchang Tso Lin from Africa, black toukioum. This gorilla head was born Ga-Bibi. He was a Sori captive. From captive to dioula, he climbed, like all the others, from the Gold Coast , his pack of kola nuts on his head. One evening when he was in high spirits and he was selling his nuts at Torongo, heseduced the king, S. M. Bitiki. He became the leader of the Bitiki gangs. This done, he sent the king to walk in his place on the road to Gold Coast . Then he advanced the throne and sat on it. It was then that the negroes saw some beautiful ones!</p><p> </p><p> He first laid hands on the states around him. This made the kingdom of Ouassoulou, of which he named himself king. Twice king and more scoundrel than ever! It even seems that Samori ate not only "a little bit of mom and dad". He swallowed everything! As he was very hungry, the twice king crossed Niger. He entered the Mandingo. There he says: "I am the emperor". The feasts redoubled.</p><p> </p><p> Borgnis-Desbordes, Frey, Boylève, Combe marched in turn against this man with a formidable appetite. The other pulled his fork from the game. We pushed him from Kita to Bamako, from Bamako to Bakoy, the Almami, because the Almami was him, always arose.</p><p> </p><p> Péroz, Humbert, Archinard got involved. Driven out of his states, he went to proclaim himself king in Kong, and chose the Lobi to supply himself with meat! Braulet followed him with a mission. He massacred the mission and perhaps Braulet. Caudrelier forced him into the forest. In short, it fell into the hands of Captain Gouraud. It was the time when Gouraud had two hands!</p><p> </p><p> Today, I am walking in Sudan, cigarette in the mouth. Ahmadou will not put me in his tata, nor Samori in the bottom of his loincloth. When crossing cities, I read street names. Rue Gallieni, rue Archinard, rue Binger. Yet another, this one! He left alone, dressed in dioula, dragging his camelotte. He recognized the way. One day he left his comrades. We did not see him reappear until two and a half years later, on the lagoons of Côte d'Ivoire. We can find the place, it's called Bingerville!</p><p> </p><p> Here is the rue du Lieutenant-de-Vaisseau-Boiteux. This lieutenant entered Timbuktu before Bonnier, before Joffre. He was massacred there. Bonnier too, by the way.</p><p> </p><p> Rue Bonnier.</p><p> </p><p> Lieutenant Mage was killed on the Niger.</p><p> </p><p> Rue Mage.</p><p> </p><p> Baratier Street.</p><p> </p><p> Voulet and Chanoine gave France the Mossi Empire. (It is now one of the eight colonies of A.O.F. We call it Upper Volta.) With fifty men, they sent back three thousand horsemen from Morho-Naba to prance further. They entered Ouagadougou.</p><p> </p><p> Learning of this, and probably a few other little things, the government sent them Lieutenant-Colonel Klobb, responsible for taking their place.</p><p> </p><p> They killed him. No rue Voulet-Chanoine . And Chanoine, it is said, would still prowl the confines of the Sahel, dressed in Targui!</p><p> </p><p> Old past! Joffre promised Cheboune, chief of the Tengueriguiffs, that each time he entered Timbuktu we would fire a cannon!</p><p> </p><p> Everyone was doing!</p><p> </p><p> It was the land of daring and young suffering.</p><p> </p><p> All this was conquered without a plan. The ministry did not know until after. It was individual walking!</p><p> </p><p> When these men were successful, they received twenty days off from Paris!</p><p> </p><p> Fortunately for the Republic they did not stop!</p><p> </p><p> That is to say, he contented himself with cutting their necks, the Muslims not being cannibals.</p><p> </p><p> "What is thirty-three years old?" I find myself as if it was yesterday… ”</p><p> </p><p> It is a general with the famous name who writes this letter to the commander of Timbuktu.</p><p> </p><p> "I never stopped thinking about that time. Ah! my Sudan! What has become of my little hut near Fort Bonnier? Where's my mousso? my son ? He was so gritty! He was named Robert. He is a man now. Where is he ? I must tell you that I have always questioned the comrades who returned from there! They knew nothing about him. His mother was named Aïssa, from the village of Kabara. Her grandfather was a laptot. I would be very grateful to you… ”</p><p> </p><p> The Métis!</p><p> </p><p> Another letter from another general:</p><p> </p><p> "You remember that in 1904 I buried a child in the cemetery of M ... near the fort. Surehis grave, I only put: Henri! If the sand hasn't covered everything, could you ... ”</p><p> </p><p> Robert at all. Henri just short. André in short. The calendar passed there whole for a long time and several times!</p><p> </p><p> The Métis! Field mice!</p><p> </p><p> Toddlers suckle their mother negress.</p><p> </p><p> The father is there or is not there. He is an official, a merchant, an officer; he is a passerby. If he is there, it will not be long. If he is absent, it will probably be forever. The child will grow up in the hut, the negro mother having returned to the parents. The rest of the village will look at him as a pariah, wondering why this milk sucker will later eat their millet. No corporate name will intervene in this summary judgment. The depreciation will be instinctive, neither white nor black, so nothing at all! The mother will remarry with a Mandingo. His little brothers, they will have a race, a family, a homeland: they will be black. The field mouse will be field mouse. He will have no name, no base, no floor for him to put his feet on. Up to the breast he sucks which is only fifty percent of himself. He will spend his life looking for his second half. When we see them, young children, they do not seem poised; sometimes they lean to one side, sometimes to the other. These are the ones left behind by a tailor toohurry. Those who collect them will never forget that they were not made to measure. They float.</p><p> </p><p> They are like these toy boats which sail in the municipal basins. As soon as they approach the edge, a stick repels them; when they reach the center, a jet of water floods them. There are lots of them. The survivors remain stained.</p><p> </p><p> Unnamed, these half-bloods are the sons of the saints of the Catholic religion. The Republic does not leave them in the bush. No ! When they are seven years old, they are torn from the maternal calabash. They are brought together in the centers, at the Métis school. They constitute the strangest category of orphans: orphans with father and mother.</p><p> </p><p> As long as the father is in Africa, he does not abandon them. Does it pass near the school? He will see them, even when he has returned, from his last leave, married to "Madame Blanc".</p><p> </p><p> We meet mestizos in the best houses, sitting between dad and madam. The colonial learned the thing en route, on the boat, kindly, to his wife. The Frenchwoman recognizes that adventure is common in the colony, and, as often she is intelligent, she welcomes the child during stays.</p><p> </p><p> As soon as she has white babies, the little mouse goes back through the door. Poor mice! The sons of theirmother, who are black, are not their brothers; their father's sons who are white are not their brothers. Maybe that's why, because they have tried so hard to understand, that they all have such big eyes?</p><p> </p><p> Those whose dad has disappeared and who have done nothing at school, we find them in the villages. The mother has grown old. It is only a negress in the black country. The child is only a first name. " Here ! says a passing white man, he's the son of Un Tel! He gives her ten sous.</p><p> </p><p> If it's a girl and she's pretty, white people know her around. We give him five francs!</p><p> </p><p> Some are more fortunate. Joseph has his dad. He eats with him every evening, at the table, next to me at Mother Vaisselle's. Her father is a cocoa buyer. Joseph is known to regulars. We caress it in passing. At nine o'clock, the cocoa buyer goes to bed. Joseph is happy, he does not yet know that there are boats that bring the white dads back to France!</p><p> </p><p> Later the males will be teachers and the girls midwives. The teacher and the midwife will marry together. The wedding is sometimes magnificent when the midwife is the governor's daughter…</p><p> </p><p> These beautiful conclusions are rare like freshness.</p><p> </p><p> The half-breed is deeply unhappy.</p><p> </p><p> The school makes them morally French, the law keeps them at the rank of the native. They are prohibited by law from bearing their father's name. At twenty, the law put them in the black army. A negro, because he was born in Dakar, Rufisque, Saint-Louis or Gorée, is a French citizen. The son of General X ..., the governor, the chief administrator, the engineer, he is Negro! If he commits a fault, he will be judged like a negro. When he gets a place, he will be paid like a negro. Nine francs per day of allowance to the black electoral official, two francs fifty for the half-breed. One hundred francs per child for the other, ten francs for him! Does he knock on the administration door? He is received like a negro. If it is a negro from Dakar who holds the pen holder, he is hunted like a dog. Henri who had spirit said to me: "We should be doing everything in the buttocks, so we would have more room to receive the kicks!" The last of the gnafrons from the four communes sends a deputy to the Seine; the half-breed remains in Niger. They are neither white nor black, neither French nor African, neither curly nor flat. The misfortune is that they are all the same something.</p><p> </p><p> - If we were nothing, said Robert, we would not suffer. And yet, look!</p><p> </p><p> Robert had taken me to his home, Mopti's own Petit Logis. Robert opened the sideboard, pulled out the drawers. I thought he was going to set the table and offer me dinner.</p><p> </p><p> - Look ! We eat on plates; we use knives, forks, spoons! We drink from glasses!</p><p> </p><p> - And this photo, I said to him, showing him on the wall a general cut from an illustrated.</p><p> </p><p> - It's daddy!</p><p> </p><p> We abandoned them. They don't say anything about it. It seems natural to them. They obscurely realize that they are not children, but accidents, and that an accident is always unfortunate. However, they were sent to schools. They recited that they were sons of Gauls. They were made to wear shoes, shirts and pants. They themselves added the glasses. We had to be careful not to teach them to read if we didn't want them to see their father's name on the newspapers!</p><p> </p><p> They do not claim the search for fatherhood. A keen feeling for their situation animates them. They know that they are only an original sin and accuse Adam of it rather than his lineage. However they have the idea of ​​redeeming themselves. Knowing therespect that we owe to the true white they do not claim to be sons of their father. It is not the name of the white man they covet, far from them this audacity, it is his nationality. No son of such, but son of French! Thus they themselves ratify their anonymity.</p><p> </p><p> André, Henri, Jacques, Robert, as much as you like, but French citizens!</p><p> </p><p> It's their dream!</p><p> </p><p> - Above all, they say, that we are the sons of those who conquered. It was hard right now, our dads couldn't bring their lady!</p><p> </p><p> Enough of tragedy!</p><p> </p><p> It is a project that sleeps at the Palais-Bourbon. Professor Girault prepared it. A deputy, please, even if he is not colonial, to bring this charter to the rostrum!</p><p> </p><p> At the end of the bush, there is the commander.</p><p> </p><p> You have to hear the thing as I will explain it to you.</p><p> </p><p> The bush is an endless field, not planted with trees, but, it seems, swifts with the handle in the ground and the sprouts blossoming in rocket.</p><p> </p><p> This is Father Fouettard's country!</p><p> </p><p> Suddenly, after two hundred kilometers, barring the road: a house.</p><p> </p><p> The house is so good in the middle that an ill-bred car would only have to continue straight to find itself in the dining room.</p><p> </p><p> It would only remain to say to the tenant:</p><p> </p><p> "Show me the menu!" "</p><p> </p><p> The tenant is an administrator. This administrator is a civilian. The negroes call him: "My commander".</p><p> </p><p> The bush has as many tips as it has commanders.</p><p> </p><p> Between each of these tips, there is generally nothing. When there are people, it's lions, hyenas, panthers, chimpanzees, warthogs, horse antelopes and a few other little things like that. Robert Poulaine, who does the same job as me, even meets hippos there. He did not smash the hippo, but the hood of his car. This will teach him to travel at night as if Time , his diary, appeared in the morning!</p><p> </p><p> The commander is the god of the bush. Without him, you would be sleeping outside. The hyenas would come to lick the soles of your shoes, and, the tongue of the hyenas being raspy, you would soon have no more shoes!</p><p> </p><p> So we arrive and we say, "Good evening, administrator!" "Then we drink our aperitifs, we scrape away the cans, we sleep in bed. We do many more! and, the next day, we leave without even asking her name! This is the bush post.</p><p> </p><p> A hundred Negroes are still crouching around these residences. The first times I looked at them without being intrigued otherwise. At the end, I say to one of these commanders:</p><p> </p><p> - What do these birds want with you?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I was going to find out. Sitting near the administrator in his office, here is what I saw and heard:</p><p> </p><p> - Bema!…</p><p> </p><p> Berna was the interpreter.</p><p> </p><p> -… Get them one by one.</p><p> </p><p> Bema called. All stood up. The first entered.</p><p> </p><p> - Come on! explain your palaver, said the commander.</p><p> </p><p> I know that palaver is feminine; here we put it in the masculine. It's not by genre, but probably to make fair compensation!</p><p> </p><p> - My commander, begins the negro, you are my father and my mother.</p><p> </p><p> It continues in bambara.</p><p> </p><p> - What is he saying ? asked the commander.</p><p> </p><p> - He says that, two years ago, he loaned four cows to Nialebé, from Sao; that these four large cows made four small cows; that Nialebé claims that they only made two small cows…</p><p> </p><p> - Where's Nialebé?</p><p> </p><p> - To Sao!</p><p> </p><p> - Let him go get it.</p><p> </p><p> - Is it far ? I asked.</p><p> </p><p> - No ! one hundred and twenty kilometers.</p><p> </p><p> The negro was given a paper towel , which, docile, left for Sao.</p><p> </p><p> The next one entered. He was strong and seemed gentle.</p><p> </p><p> - What do you want, pipe head?</p><p> </p><p> - He says his wife is gone.</p><p> </p><p> - What does he want me to do? What is he still stammering?</p><p> </p><p> - He says that his wife is not good, that yesterday she had not prepared millet and that he "yelled at her". She insulted him by the name of her mother. So he gave her ... a slap!</p><p> </p><p> The negroes speak the French that we taught them.</p><p> </p><p> - Why is he coming to tell me this?</p><p> </p><p> - He says you have to bring his wife back because he paid her for a kid, four chickens, and half a leg.</p><p> </p><p> - Ask him what he did with the other half of the leg?</p><p> </p><p> - He says the other half was rotten, he ate it because he likes it very much.</p><p> </p><p> - Tell him he's a bastard and that he ... the camp.</p><p> </p><p> - You! f… your camp, says the interpreter.</p><p> </p><p> The negro went out and sat down again in front of the residence. He will wait for better times.</p><p> </p><p> Another.</p><p> </p><p> - What is he saying ?</p><p> </p><p> - He says he came three weeks ago because Samba had broken his canary.</p><p> </p><p> - So ?</p><p> </p><p> - He says that you told him to ask Samba for 30 cents, that he asked for it and that Samba gave it to him.</p><p> </p><p> - So what does he want?</p><p> </p><p> - He says he doesn't want anything anymore, that he came to tell you that. That's all.</p><p> </p><p> Six days of walking to come, six to return. We will write after that that the negroes are lazy!</p><p> </p><p> Another.</p><p> </p><p> - He asks if you recognize him.</p><p> </p><p> - Is he paying for my head? says the administrator.</p><p> </p><p> - He says that, a year ago, you told him to go to Abecher ...</p><p> </p><p> (I do the calculation: it must represent three thousand kilometers.)</p><p> </p><p> -… to claim a debt of three hundred francs.</p><p> </p><p> - So ?</p><p> </p><p> - He went to Abecher. Whoever owed him three hundred francs was dead. He came back (six thousand kilometers). He tells you that.</p><p> </p><p> - Where is he from ?</p><p> </p><p> - He's from San.</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! he is from San? Ask him if he is tired.</p><p> </p><p> - He's not tired.</p><p> </p><p> - Then he will return to San illico . There is just this bag to carry to the commander.</p><p> </p><p> The interpreter puts the bag on the head of the citizen of San.</p><p> </p><p> - You understand, he said to her. You carry the bag to San's commander, you run.</p><p> </p><p> The negro remains bewildered.</p><p> </p><p> - If you are not happy, you can!</p><p> </p><p> The box ! all blacks know this word.</p><p> </p><p> - Me happy! is it.</p><p> </p><p> Under load, he hit the road for a new little walk of three hundred kilometers.</p><p> </p><p> We noticed a woman in the pile.</p><p> </p><p> - Bring the mousso, Bema.</p><p> </p><p> If we admit that a calico strip on the hips and a calabash on the head do not constitute clothing, the mousso was naked. She was young too. She came from Ke twelve days from here.</p><p> </p><p> - Did she have money? I asked.</p><p> </p><p> - She says she had no money.</p><p> </p><p> - How did she travel?</p><p> </p><p> - She stopped every evening in a village, she lowered her calabash. We filled it up. Is not it ? What is her name ?</p><p> </p><p> - Kisili.</p><p> </p><p> - And when the village chief was not too Kisili was paying his couscous in his own way, huh?</p><p> </p><p> - Grou! says Kisili to whom we translate the thing, grou! grou!</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! what does she want</p><p> </p><p> - She says that her husband beat her and stole the boubous that a white man married to his sister had given her.</p><p> </p><p> - Twelve days of walking to tell me that? Whether she goes back to her husband's place or I put it in the box.</p><p> </p><p> Kisili put his calabash up on his head and went back to her husband.</p><p> </p><p> - Bring in the old man.</p><p> </p><p> He was worthy. He waved like a fatma.</p><p> </p><p> - Go on, said the administrator.</p><p> </p><p> - He says that last month he sent his wife to carry millet to the village of Mâ. A man from Ma took it from him. He says that he found this man and that this man told him that another from the village of Tebi had taken it from him.</p><p> </p><p> - So you want your wife?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes.</p><p> </p><p> - What if the other two gave him the disease?</p><p> </p><p> He smiles.</p><p> </p><p> - It will still be a woman! he said.</p><p> </p><p> - Go sit down again. We'll see.</p><p> </p><p> Another old man. This one doesn't need an interpreter.</p><p> </p><p> - My commander, hi! Hello to the madam commander. I'm coming to tell you that my wife is running all over the village.</p><p> </p><p> - How old are you ?</p><p> </p><p> - Sixty years.</p><p> </p><p> - And your wife ?</p><p> </p><p> - Eighteen years.</p><p> </p><p> - She is excusable, you have to understand things, you who are intelligent.</p><p> </p><p> - Me very intelligent and I understand. But she why come to my hut with her lovers? Do you understand, Commander? With them, not with me! Easy, all the same!</p><p> </p><p> - And will you be happy?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes. But I still want her to eat my food. She, there is a lot of it, she can please the other and couscous to me without ever tiring.</p><p> </p><p> - Tell him to obey you or I'll put it in the box.</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! commanding officer. To be riveted! Thank you ! Hi !</p><p> </p><p> They brought in a skirmisher.</p><p> </p><p> He arrived on his bare feet; putting himself at attention, he shouted himself: "Fisque! "</p><p> </p><p> Under his shechia, he picked up a letter and held it out. They read: "My commander, you who are more powerful than the Lord, you who are worthy of the Bastille,I come to tell you: Take my wife, since I am going to Casablanca. Keep it until my military service returns. Put it in the box, His father is called Tianti Calla Sakabu, his mother Perai Dao. Me, Patomo Faraolé. Make sure that the skirmishers do not damage it. I greet you at close range, I roll respectfully at your feet and I sign with happy and satisfied desires, your certified copy. - Patomo . "</p><p> </p><p> - Patomo! if you were only asked for five francs to write this letter, you were not stolen.</p><p> </p><p> - Yes ! five francs!</p><p> </p><p> - Where is she, your mousso?</p><p> </p><p> He went out and brought her.</p><p> </p><p> - Here she is!</p><p> </p><p> - How do you find her, said the administrator. You like her ?</p><p> </p><p> - Phew! the chest is tempting, but the head ...</p><p> </p><p> - So take her back to her parents, otherwise, I'll put you in the box. Understood ?</p><p> </p><p> - Me understood, Commander.</p><p> </p><p> It was noon. We went upstairs to get the bitter.</p><p> </p><p> And I arrived at Niafounké.</p><p> </p><p> It is a village like that, on Niger, when you walk towards Timbuktu.</p><p> </p><p> A negro, picked up, strong, dragged a bigger one, by the wrist. It was at the market. Every hundred meters, the two accomplices stopped. The strong man let go of his man and, raising his arms, he began to scream, in front of the assembled crowd.</p><p> </p><p> The other, head bowed, suffered the apostrophe.</p><p> </p><p> Then the barker caught him again, led him further; the session started again.</p><p> </p><p> Then he passed a white man, who wore an old cheeky helmet, one of those fog helmets, which recount for themselves the tornadoes, the wintering, the sandstorms, the sunburns and the attacks which, from below , leads the cockroach.</p><p> </p><p> - You must speak the language, I said to him, what does that say?</p><p> </p><p> - He shouts: "Commander's order." " Herea disgusting, filthy bastard, an ugly big pig, who peed in midday on the beautiful public square.</p><p> </p><p> - Say, because your helmet is the dirtiest I have ever seen, is that a reason to pay you the head of a stranger?</p><p> </p><p> - Damn you ! he said.</p><p> </p><p> He disappeared.</p><p> </p><p> I went to the commander's house.</p><p> </p><p> "Is it true," I said to him, "that your barker shouts:" Here is a disgusting man who did ... "?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, it's true. They are very proud and that annoys them.</p><p> </p><p> We shouldn't be bored in Niafounké. I stopped there. Exactly, it was court day.</p><p> </p><p> The physiognomy of the residence was statutory. A hundred blacks were waiting, seated in front of the house. However, I seemed to notice something new. Under the veranda, a bench; on this bench, five negroes, obviously superior to the others. They were canton chiefs in detention! It seems that they got drunk, that they lacked authority. The god of the bush had "stuck" them eight days of picket! They were five prefects in donkey caps! Sacred Africa!</p><p> </p><p> Justice in the bush has no palace. It has no judges either. She might have aOak ? It's not just cheese makers! Justice is the commander.</p><p> </p><p> A commander is a universal man. During a riot, he became a marshal. In a period of famine, he is a steward. If the river or the hippos blow up a bridge, he is the engineer. Driver of bridges, he is also of the roadway. Two years ago, we were looking in France, on all sides, for a Minister of Finance, each commander is one! He is counsel. We have seen that he was a guy. In the forests, it will be forest; on the coast, boater, and in the desert, he will become a camel! Today he is a judge.</p><p> </p><p> Let's judge!</p><p> </p><p> We settled in a room in the residence, the commander before a table, the interpreter at his side. Flanking the table, two moricauds of the most beautiful water, two notables: the jurors. Forward!</p><p> </p><p> The first complainant was not decent. The string around him was falling apart! He could take his new suit when he comes to court!</p><p> </p><p> - What does he want ? asked the captain.</p><p> </p><p> The man left in a long speech. Believing that he had spoken enough, the commander stopped him. The interpreter translated:</p><p> </p><p> - He says that having inherited the two women from his father, one of whom was his mother, he married his mother to one of his friends who, in exchange, had promised him a cow. However, after two months, the friend returned his mother to him saying that he preferred his cow. He asks that the friend take back his mother and give him a sheep since he finds that his mother is not worth a cow.</p><p> </p><p> - What do the notables think? asked the captain.</p><p> </p><p> The notables slept.</p><p> </p><p> "See those bastards," said the captain, and struck the table with a heavy blow. The others jumped. Informed, the notables wanted to know the age of the mother.</p><p> </p><p> "About twice my age," said the son.</p><p> </p><p> The notables replied that it was not even worth a kid!</p><p> </p><p> The rifleman on guard then seized the unfortunate son and threw him into the courtyard.</p><p> </p><p> We moved on to the next case.</p><p> </p><p> It was an attempted murder.</p><p> </p><p> The wounded man entered, dragging himself behind him. The attacker followed him and helped him to place himself fraternally.</p><p> </p><p> - So ?</p><p> </p><p> - So, said the interpreter, here it is: the people of the village were gathered to beat millet. The father ofthat one owed 13 fr. 50 at large. The tall man said, "Give me the money your daddy owes me." "</p><p> </p><p> The other replied:</p><p> </p><p> - Give me a deadline.</p><p> </p><p> The great says:</p><p> </p><p> - It will cost you dear.</p><p> </p><p> The other called him "little eyes". Under this grave insult, the tall man cut him with his cutter.</p><p> </p><p> - Why did you do it ?</p><p> </p><p> - Allah! Iake! Iake! It is God who willed it, replies the murderer.</p><p> </p><p> - Did you hit?</p><p> </p><p> - No ! Commander, it was my hand that struck.</p><p> </p><p> - What do the notables say?</p><p> </p><p> - They say that, according to custom, you should give the great hundred strokes of the rope, put it in irons until the other is healed, and kill it if the wounded man dies.</p><p> </p><p> - How is the wounded man?</p><p> </p><p> - He says it is as good as a doe can be worn when it has received a spear in the leg.</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! three months in prison, huh?</p><p> </p><p> "The notables," said the interpreter, "say that because of the" little eyes, "that would be worth four.</p><p> </p><p> - One more month for the "little eyes"!</p><p> </p><p> Next.</p><p> </p><p> Two blacks and a mousso entered.</p><p> </p><p> - What do they want?</p><p> </p><p> "This one," said the interpreter, pointing to the smallest, "is a former sharpshooter. He returns from France. This one is his wife; the other is the rifleman's brother. The tirailleur, before his departure, had entrusted his wife to his brother. Today he files a complaint against his brother because his brother did not take care of his wife.</p><p> </p><p> - She is not skinny, however!</p><p> </p><p> - He says that his brother gave him food and that he is happy about that. But the brother did him great insult and great harm. During these two years, he did not touch his wife. He said that when he got home he thought he had a child; that he doesn't have one; that thus, it is impoverished. He is asking for compensation.</p><p> </p><p> - You hear that! said the commander. Finally !…</p><p> </p><p> The two notables were no longer snoring. They were asked what they thought, according to custom. They consulted.</p><p> </p><p> - They say, says the interpreter, that we should ask the woman if it's true.</p><p> </p><p> - laugh! said the mousso. Which meant: it's true!</p><p> </p><p> - So they say the brother owes him compensation.</p><p> </p><p> - What does the culprit think? I asked.</p><p> </p><p> - The culprit says that he admits having caused damage to his brother. He says that you can condemn him, that he is full of regrets like fish is with bones, but that his brother's wife did not please him!</p><p> </p><p> This cost three delicate goats!</p><p> </p><p> We continued. He entered another woman and two men. It was adultery. The husband, the wife and the lover . The husband was old, but he had a magnificent boubou; the woman was Peuhl and wore a beautiful youth without veil. The lover was poor: a string, an iron comb.</p><p> </p><p> The husband says:</p><p> </p><p> - My wife has slept with him ten times. I ask for a hundred francs.</p><p> </p><p> "He also wants the iron comb," said the interpreter.</p><p> </p><p> - Ask mousso if it's true.</p><p> </p><p> - She says it's true.</p><p> </p><p> - Ask her why she did this.</p><p> </p><p> The mousso cooed and, head down, spoke between her breasts.</p><p> </p><p> - She says that when there is no more millet in her hut, we will look elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p> - Well said ! said the commander. And the lover , what does he say?</p><p> </p><p> - He says he was happy.</p><p> </p><p> The two notables looked at the Peuhl for a long time.</p><p> </p><p> - What do they think according to custom?</p><p> </p><p> - They think that, the woman being pretty, a hundred francs is not expensive.</p><p> </p><p> - What about the comb?</p><p> </p><p> - That he must return the comb.</p><p> </p><p> The lover did not have a cowry!</p><p> </p><p> - I know it well, said the husband, while he comes to work my lougan for a month.</p><p> </p><p> - You accept ? asked the captain.</p><p> </p><p> The lover said that he accepted. And the three of them left, kindly.</p><p> </p><p> The next case was also that of a trio.</p><p> </p><p> This time the husband only asked for thirty francs.</p><p> </p><p> - Let's go ! twenty francs, says the commander.</p><p> </p><p> - You understand, said the husband, my wife is my property. When I lend an animal, I tire my animal, I am given compensation. My wife is like my animal: you, understand, commander?</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! twenty-five francs!</p><p> </p><p> - No ! Thirty francs.</p><p> </p><p> The lover intervened and said:</p><p> </p><p> - Fifteen francs!</p><p> </p><p> - Does the mousso recognize the offense?</p><p> </p><p> - She recognizes.</p><p> </p><p> - Sixteen francs! said the lover , as if overcome with remorse of conscience.</p><p> </p><p> The husband wanted thirty francs. We never ended. Then the commander exclaimed:</p><p> </p><p> - I say twenty francs. If the two men don't want to work it out, I slip the mousso and the lover out of the box.</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! no, my commander, said the husband, not my mousso. Ji take the twenty francs.</p><p> </p><p> The matter was thus settled.</p><p> </p><p> Cows, donkeys, women, we do not get out of these cases. But for women, it is much less serious: we get along more easily than for cows!</p><p> </p><p> And the pilgrimage will be accomplished. A name rings in this immensity. From black to black, Sudan is crossed. The country of the least happy of men told us a little what it was. Laptots are taking us forward on Niger. They weigh with all their strength on their pole, encouraging each other with the song of their complaints, so that the white, this visible god, is satisfied.</p><p> </p><p> It no longer seems to us now that we are only piercing the shadows. The dark spoke to us, the bush lit up. Timbuktu will appear.</p><p> </p><p> Does this people who have nothing - nothing - have something all the same? So he has a city with a name? Poor as he is, so he wants to give a gift to our imagination? We will not disdain it. We go up to get it. Tomorrow, we will plunge back into its misery. We will see him again naked, helpless, with his domestic animal eyes; today let's bethe honor that it prepares for us. He will show us Timbuktu.</p><p> </p><p> Bafoulabé, Toukoto, Kita, Bamako, Ségou, Macina, Dioura, Diré, Niafounké, the stations on our way, what was it? It was only black Africa in its powerful anonymity, a few small spots under a bitter sun, names without prestige, valid only for the bushmen or the surveyors of the geographical service.</p><p> </p><p> Kabara is already in sight. It is this village at the end of the canal that feeds Niger. From there we will cross the last bush before the desert, which probably authorizes, in comparison with what will follow, to be called forest! Seven kilometers after…</p><p> </p><p> Poor Negro country! White people, your adopted sons, don't want to leave you the prestige of a legend. They tear off until your last foul. They don't want Timbuktu to be anything. When they learn you are going, they laugh at you in the face. A pilgrim who goes up to Timbuktu loses its value, in their eyes. He passes for a poet, which is a great shame in our time.</p><p> </p><p> Let's face it: our barge touches Kabara.</p><p> </p><p> A barge is a very good animal, especially when you have to leave it for a horse! The horse is there, waiting for me. As long as he heard of itof Locarno and that it be peaceful? In any case, so that he is not mistaken, I take care when advancing towards him to take a bridle look. He's an Arabian horse on top of the market! I don't want to go fast. Can we not hinder his legs? It seems that this is not possible. The animal seems to be in possession of all its means! So there are no donkeys in Kabara? Finally ! he is not excited! Fortunately, horses only drink water!</p><p> </p><p> No road to go to Timbuktu. We ride through the trees like a deer god. Strange god! wearing dark glasses and a cork bell on his head. The branches of the trees bite you, you look at what they have: toothpicks! In this country that offers you nothing to eat, trees have toothpicks! The waters of Niger being high, they walk in the forest. Good waters! It seems that they are stretching as far as they can to try, once a year, to give water to the desert. In any case, a backwater bars the way, you have to get off your horse. So much won!</p><p> </p><p> The beast is unsaddled. We put the saddle on his arm. A dug tree trunk takes you to the other bank. You are there. Ten meters of water now separate you from the horse. We are already happy. They give him small sly signs from afar;the animal runs into the creek, and you come to any swim! I give him a white pebble, as sugar, hoping to disgust him forever. He is not upset. Only it is wet!</p><p> </p><p> More than three kilometers. Provided that my skin on which I sit hold to the end? A stone pyramid. What is she doing there? It feels so far from the world that everything that reminds you moved. Lieutenant Lame ship fell there. This is the last shaded point. We can already see the sands.</p><p> </p><p> And here is the rag tree. A Muslim returning from Mecca stopped here. He died there. The tree has become a favorite. All those who pass tear a piece of their boubou and tie it to a branch. They will have a new boubou in the year and luck for the rest of the way. Let’s leave half of our handkerchief. Do we know?</p><p> </p><p> Suddenly more trees! Before you is a large river of sand. The Sahel! The end of the Sahara! We rise on the stirrups. Not yet !</p><p> </p><p> The horse sinks. The hooves make no more noise. The silence which was everywhere, however, seems, this time, to say that it is there.</p><p> </p><p> Everything is white around you. The desert ripples. A light wind makes the small ridges flutter. A camel sails on the horizon. Earth ! Earth!… Timbuktu!</p><p> </p><p> First two blocks, two houses extend their terrace. One would not have thought that they were so high! It's just a mirage. They have only one floor. The vision widens and, like an extravagant molehill, the city emerges in the middle of its defense: the sand. Nothing precedes it, nothing surrounds it but immensity. It is a heap of grayish and badly beaten earth. But if there was only one star in the sky, it would look prettier and everyone would know its name!</p><p> </p><p> Timbuktu!</p><p> </p><p> Second pyramid:</p><p> </p><p> TO COLONEL BONNIER</p><p> ENTRY IN TOMBOUCTOU</p><p> ON JANUARY 10, 1894</p><p> KILLED</p><p> IN TACOUBAO</p><p> WITH 10 OFF., 2 S.-OFF. AND 80 TIRAILL.</p><p> JANUARY 15, 1894</p><p> </p><p> In the desert especially, the gods are thirsty!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> We talked about the terraces of Timbuktu. We did well. However, don't get in the way, these terraces are without flowers, without water jets. These are the ceilings of the roofless huts. They are not marble, but mud. One cannot say that they rise because they fall. And whenyou do not see anyone on it, it is that the inhabitants have just passed through!</p><p> </p><p> Timbuktu! burning maze!</p><p> </p><p> Apart from the place where we raised our six or seven buildings, buildings seeming to delimit a vast swimming pool where we would only take sand baths, the rest are corridors that do not weld well to each other, much more often knobby than straight , or the bandits, if there were any, would wait for you every hundred meters in a comfortable corner.</p><p> </p><p> Earth cubed, there are the houses, the cube pierced with a low entrance, and the windows carrying at the head, like a nobility, carved woods.</p><p> </p><p> It is also a market. It is the city without race. Here, it is no longer the whites who left their mestizos, but the Arabs, the Tuareg, the all-blacks. It is a crucible. After months of desert or long climb on Niger it was the city of pleasure, the night expected of caravanners.</p><p> </p><p> Timbuktu is still that. Hi !</p><p> </p><p> Here is the mosque and its cone pierced with bits of wood like the cheeks of a fakir are needles.</p><p> </p><p> It repairs it. It fell and all that is mud, as well as the city ...</p><p> </p><p> The other day, Major Févez had the cadi called:</p><p> </p><p> - Look, he said, I'm not Muslim, and your stories don't concern me, but your mosque tumbles. Muhammad should no longer know what to say to Allah; don't you think we should retype it?</p><p> </p><p> The qadi the thought.</p><p> </p><p> Today, all of Timbuktu works at the mosque. The drum, constantly, excites the plasters. The women, the beautiful sonraïs, redeeming their sins, carry the water; men, banco balls; the old men, leaning on their stick, encourage their arms and their voices. It will be magnificent. The more sinful a city is, the richer the temples.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> What do the white people have against the famous city? All went there to see the mystery, and it seems, have not seen it. The mystery is not seen, my friends, it is felt. He speaks speechless like a deaf-mute. There are plenty of deserted alleys. So you have not attended to the Azalaï? It is in May. The caravanners come from the mines of Taoudeni; they bring to Timbuktu the salt that will stall Sudan, Upper Volta, Senegal, Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast , the interior and the whole coast! We see twelve thousand, thirteen thousand camels emerging from the Sahel. The arrival alone lasts two days, three days. It is the desert which walks on stilts.</p><p> </p><p> The women of Timbuktu, the Fachis , have put on their most beautiful boubous. The linen is well starched. The crest of their hairstyle is redone that morning; three balls of hair, braided with multicolored wool, running over the proud edge. Their gold is on their ears, their silver they have put on bracelets is on their wrists and ankles. Those who have an umbrella are much more beautiful! They emerge from the low doors of their houses, fill the alleys, reach the desert. They will, while singing, receive the Azalai .</p><p> </p><p> - Haré! Haré! they say (Let's sing! Let's sing!). Caravanners are magnificent men. We will bring them water to wash. And if the one who chooses me is the most beautiful, I know what I will give him.</p><p> </p><p> They go, fanning themselves from their range of palm fibers.</p><p> </p><p> - Haré! Haré! The man from the West is a handsome man. If it is veiled it is so that his lips do not taste like sand!</p><p> </p><p> They are all there, the sonraïs, all the young people!</p><p> </p><p> - Haré! Haré! The well man has a lot of gifts, I am only sixteen and have no children on my back!</p><p> </p><p> On the evening of Azaldai , Kanambous, husbands, do not sleep in their wife 's hut.</p><p> </p><p> - Haré! Haré!</p><p> </p><p> But the next day their wives bring them millet and tobacco! ...</p><p> </p><p> The party ended, we can still hear the sonraï singing:</p><p> </p><p> - Haré! Haré! The man from the West is back on the road, but he has no money at all!</p><p> </p><p> Haré! Haré!</p><p> </p><p> Extract from a report by Mr. Clozel, former governor of Sudan:</p><p> </p><p> “  Since 1895, Mr. Dupuis has lived in Timbuktu. By his erudition, by his extraordinary knowledge of men and things of the country, he created himself in the region an absolutely unique situation. There is not a sedentary from the north of the Niger loop who does not worship the name of Yacouba under which it is popular to the bottom of the desert, beyond Oualata and Taoudéni…</p><p> </p><p> "  He was for all, in difficult times, the precious auxiliary whose reliable advice avoids these political mistakes which can have the greatest consequences ...</p><p> </p><p> “  There is not a column, a reconnaissance which left Tombouctou without the commander having Mr. Dupuis by his side.</p><p> </p><p> "  If we visited Taoudéni without a hitch, if, a few months ago, we arrived peacefully at the gates of Oualata, it is much to him that we owe it.</p><p> </p><p> “  Lately, the success of the Laverdure column in the Gourma was a bit of his work and there, Mr. Dupuis also knew how to show under fire the greatest energy and the calmest composure.</p><p> </p><p> "  Such brilliant services must not go unrewarded. It would be a crying injustice. Arabic, songhay, tamachek dialect, bombara, peuhl are as familiar to him as french. That's why I have the honor, Mr. Governor-General to propose to admit within indigenous affairs, with the Senior Assistant Grade 3 E class ...</p><p> </p><p> "  No more than I do you know that this exceptional man came to Africa as a Catholic missionary, that he freed himself from all professional ties to devote himself solely to the service of France, in Sudan ...  "</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I started from Place Joffre, that big sand bath in Timbuktu; immediately I was in the maze. I had to take the streets that sped northward. I was also aware that, to find yourself, you have to start by getting lost. For the first time since my departure, I tasted the pleasure of walking. Timbuktu accompanies you, talking to you constantly from the top of its smallruins. It is the most eloquent silence in Africa. I was going to Yacouba's. Here you don't have to look up to see what's going on, everything is at eye level. So, in an alley where I was lost, I saw a sign above a door. Was there any rental accommodation in Timbuktu? I read: "Here lived René Caillié in 1828." It was there! The first white man who went to Timbuktu and returned! The false Arab, the French who put on make-up for five years and whom scurvy, probably to help in his disguise, disfigured! René Caillié! Just a hundred years. The unfortunate ! Glory is expensive.</p><p> </p><p> - Yacouba? I asked a Negro child.</p><p> </p><p> The Negro child took my hand and led me to a hut.</p><p> </p><p> The door hole yawns in the white facade. Curved, I went down two steps. The little tavern where I was was so dark that I couldn't see it any more. My dark glasses removed, I saw a shape that seemed human, then two others. They were three women sitting on the clay court. One was black, the other two mestizos.</p><p> </p><p> - Mr. Yacouba? I said.</p><p> </p><p> He was not at home. I went out and leaned against the bread oven common to the whole neighborhood. In the silence of the lane, I waited. A man came from the east, a very strange European. He worea long white beard, the helmet, a boubou, palikare pants. A cane in one hand, in the other hand, a pipe and a tobacco pouch made of a leaf of I do not know which tree. Her feet were bare in a leather envelope. He had a smile on his face.</p><p> </p><p> - Are you Mister Yacouba?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, Yacouba.</p><p> </p><p> We went into his house.</p><p> </p><p> - Here is my wife, he said when we were in the dark tavern, it's Salama.</p><p> </p><p> - Hello Madam ! (the negress of earlier).</p><p> </p><p> - My two daughters! (the half-breeds).</p><p> </p><p> Let's go up to my private apartment, I reserved a European corner for myself.</p><p> </p><p> Two courses crossed. In the last, a young Negress with a tempting body stacks millet.</p><p> </p><p> - A captive of my wife. She is family, you know!</p><p> </p><p> The earth staircase led us into a long room, furnished with a table, chairs, an armchair. Bottles were waiting in the corner for the hour of their sacrifice. A second captive, beautiful and naked, crossed the room.</p><p> </p><p> - I adapted, said Yacouba with a smile. Here, it's all natural. Nobody thinks badly. This life is not fake like the life ofFrance. We're going to drink an aperitif. Take tobacco in my joke, there is no fresher.</p><p> </p><p> - The laptots who pushed me on Niger asked me to say hello, Mr. Yacouba. In the vast country, I only hear about you.</p><p> </p><p> I immediately saw that his fame did not prevent him from sleeping.</p><p> </p><p> - I like black people. I like Timbuktu where Dupuis died, where Yacouba was born. In 1902, when I was Père Blanc, the natives already made me a citizen of the city. My patent bore: "He will participate in all our rights as in all our obligations. However, he will keep his religion, like us, ours. And I went to the chores on the roads, with them. Later, the notables approved me as one of their own by incorporating me into a secret clan. It was giving me more than their soul. The other black members of my neighborhood are even all dead. I remain the only representative of the negroes. They know that I will not betray them. I am one of them, I left the white clan. You ask me what was my life like?</p><p> </p><p> He did not want to stir it all up.</p><p> </p><p> - My life ? She is as you see her.</p><p> </p><p> - You were born on a certain day, however?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I was born on rue des Bilettes, in Paris, which is now rue des Archives, opposite the Protestant temple. My father was a Vms merchant. But have a drink, it's necessary in this country! Cheers ! I was going to my grandparents, peasants, around Château-Thierry. - At eleven, I don't know by what miracle, I found myself at the Soissons seminary. I did not feel the vocation, but it pleased my mom. Afterwards, I was vicar in Marbe, parish priest in Morgny, in Thiérache. In 1891, I went to the White Fathers whom I worship. Two years of study in Algiers.</p><p> </p><p> Then the hour struck. I was from the first missionary caravan sent to Sudan. It was not like today. How long did it take you to come from Dakar?</p><p> </p><p> - Nineteen days, strolling.</p><p> </p><p> - By walking fast, I put eighty-seven. It was I who founded the Timbuktu mission in May 1895. It seems that it has been thirty-three years, the age of Our Lord. From 1897 to 1904, I was superior of this mission.</p><p> </p><p> - Yacouba? where does this name come from?</p><p> </p><p> - How did I become Yacouba? Yacouba is obviously not the translation of Dupuis, nor of Auguste-Victor, my first names. Yacouba means Jacob in Hebrew and Arabic. A few days after our arrival in Timbuktu, the notables, led by the cadi Daounaki, came to give usvisit. " What is your name ? They asked my superior, Father Hacquart.</p><p> </p><p> "- Abdallah!</p><p> </p><p> "And what of your friend's?"</p><p> </p><p> "- Yacouba!</p><p> </p><p> "Father," I said to him after the fact, "you could have chosen a less Yepy name!</p><p> </p><p> “He was taken aback. I remained Yacouba.</p><p> </p><p> - Did you make a column with the army?</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! Yes ! in 1900, with lieutenant Pichon, in Araouan.</p><p> </p><p> - Then in Taoudéni, then in the Gourma, then ...</p><p> </p><p> - I knew all these gentlemen officers. Do you know how Gouraud caught his first twenty days off? A group of Touareg bored us in the forest of Kabara. He went there, and received a good blow, even that I had neither tincture of iodine nor bandage to cure it. But the region was cleaned, the road free to Niger. A few days after a dispatch arrived from Paris. I was about to uncork my last bottle to celebrate its third stripe. The ministry sent him twenty days of arrest! We weren't spoiled right now.</p><p> </p><p> - And how are you no longer White Father?</p><p> </p><p> He looked at me with two eyes filled with an old disturbance.</p><p> </p><p> - Excuse me, I am not embarrassed, but the words I would just like no longer come to me in French, they come to me in Sonraï. Do not you speak sonraï? Here. In Timbuktu, I was no longer happy. Unable to resist my nature, I left the society of the White Fathers, to avoid major scandals.</p><p> </p><p> - So ?</p><p> </p><p> - I went to the administration and said: I leave the dress.</p><p> </p><p> " - What will you do ?</p><p> </p><p> "- I'm going to go to Koriommé with the fishermen.</p><p> </p><p> " - Impossible !</p><p> </p><p> "- Appoint me director of the port, with sixty francs a month, that's all I need. I will work for France.</p><p> </p><p> It was too expensive. I went down to Koriommé. Like a negro, I lived there with my black friends. I married Salama there. My wife had only been married to Europeans, I took the children of other Europeans, the captives, the whole house. I have seven children of my own, two of whom are in the cemetery; in all, I have thirteen including that of my eldest daughter. She was with a white man who left like all the white men. We never saw him again.</p><p> </p><p> - Victor! You will see the number.</p><p> </p><p> A small, almost white piece arrived, naked as black.</p><p> </p><p> - Where does this gentleman come from? asked Yacouba.</p><p> </p><p> - From rue des Billettes!</p><p> </p><p> Paris? France ? The French grandson does not know these names! The country of white people, for him, is rue des Billettes!</p><p> </p><p> Yacouba continued:</p><p> </p><p> - Governor Clozel passed to Koriommé. "A Negro fisherman? he said, "what have we done with you?" He got angry. He opened the administration door to me, not without great difficulty. And I returned to Timbuktu. I took a cook. Salama no longer pounded millet. We trimmed my boubous, lengthened my pants, cut my cadi cane, replaced my turban with a helmet. Salama said to me: "Poor Yacouba! now i'm a young lady and you are toubab! Maybe I look like that, that's all, my soul is Negro.</p><p> </p><p> - I was told that you had decided to go to France once, but that in Bamako, having seen the railway, you were so disgusted that you went back to Timbuktu.</p><p> </p><p> - We told you the truth. However, I went to France. I wanted to see my mother again, show her my children. I was completely disoriented. I no longer felt like this white country. I tell you,my soul to the bottom is negro, I am fortunately decivilized. In the Thiérache campaign, it was still going well; but in the cities! This foolish life! You do not realize it, but your existence is worthy of the craziest. These people who run, who run to always come back to the same place in their house! Ah! no ! In Africa, you feel alive. We are good. The mind is not mean. Nothing is damaged by prejudice. While at home! "Your children are black," my brother pointed out to me on this trip. Here everyone understands that I was not normally allowed to expect more whites. You ask me if my little ones wanted to stay in France? Not ! After a month, we all said, "Where is our old Timbuktu? "I am a defrock, sir! It banishes me from society, in France. My poor kids honor their father in Africa. Paul said to me the other day, coming back from the opening of the dike: "Dad, why are you staying behind the gentlemen like that?" He believes his father is someone. Alas! a white man may make them ashamed of me later. It is a thought that often prevents me from enjoying their presence around me.</p><p> </p><p> - However, you are said to be happy.</p><p> </p><p> - Sentenced to exile, I knew how to love my horizon and was very attached to it.</p><p> </p><p> - And your former comrades, the White Fathers?</p><p> </p><p> - One came to Timbuktu the other day. He said mass. I asked her permission to attend. He was very happy. The holy man prayed for me. As for the others, I sometimes write to them like a ghost.</p><p> </p><p> - Do they answer you?</p><p> </p><p> Yacouba got up. He moved a few bottles of aperitif, opened a hatch, took out an iron box. A letter came out of it that the termites had not been able to eat.</p><p> </p><p> - Read, he said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> "  Apostolic Vicariate of Sudan,</p><p> January 12, 1928.</p><p> “  My very dear colleague, because, despite everything and beyond all the vicissitudes of life, I have always considered and loved you as such and I know that all my other colleagues from Sudan share with me the same feelings towards you . If ever, on my return to Sudan, I go to Timbuktu, you will agree, won't you, that I pay you a visit? Be quiet and without ulterior motives, I will not annoy you or seek to assault anything what is personal to you, and we will leave best friends only at the start of the interview.</p><p> </p><p> "  My blessing? You ask for it? I give it to you big, broad, immensely fraternal and I kiss you as never brother kissed his brother. Your old and extremely affectionate brother in Jesus and Mary.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Fernand Sauvant , vicar apostolic of Sudan . "﻿</p><p> </p><p> When I had finished reading the letter, old Yacouba was crying. No doubt he knew it by heart ...</p><p> </p><p> By Mercury! By its fins flapping on its helmet and ankles, if I had a dog I would order three small dogs, the most mean, of course! one for Mrs. Édouard Herriot, the second for Mrs. Paul Morand and the third for Morand Paul.</p><p> </p><p> These pleasant travelers were in Niafounké. I had even had the pleasure before, to meet them in Bamako. Together we had crossed a part of the Sahel, gun in hand to kill lions, panthers, hyenas, ostriches, everything that bears a name in feathers and hair. We had only managed to kill (half happily) the very sympathetic Mr. Peyron, resident in Macina. Finally ! he still lives, and many years, I hope, remain for him to curse us!</p><p> </p><p> In Niafounké we took Niger. Two barges awaited us. Here, give me your full attention, the drama begins. They put ina barge the food, drink and utensils which the whites usually use for eating.</p><p> </p><p> All went very well. Mrs. Herriot, despite our advice, was bathing in Niger, so we were in arms to watch the caimans. In the afternoon we played poker and this time we watched each other. Henri Béraud, in memory of a tumultuous past, having donated a phonograph to me when I left, in the evenings we listened to the phonograph. It was the deal. Just if you didn't kiss before going to bed.</p><p> </p><p> The barges remained in Kabara. The Herriot-Morand caravan went up to Timbuktu. Then she came back down while I stayed there. She would take her barge. Mine would be waiting for me. Goodbye ! Goodbye ! Good trip back! Hello in Paris, I shouted to these perfect eight-day companions, until they had disappeared behind the toothpick trees.</p><p> </p><p> Timbuktu occupied me. From the cadi to the cemetery, from the nomads to the sedentary, from the desert to the alleys, from the sun to the moon it lasted many days ”, Finally, one afternoon, the little horse reappeared. He was even still as Arab and as dashing! It was time to get back on track.</p><p> </p><p> I arrive in Kabara. The barge is there. A non-commissioned officer wants me to collect him. He returns to France. Wherever I go, it will save her time. Come on up, non-commissioned officer! Farewell, Commander Févez, my dear host! Farewell, Monsieur Guy! On your poles, laptots! Four days from Niger to Mopti will rest the soles of our feet. After we will spin like the horse antelope on Ouagadougou.</p><p> </p><p> The barge slides. The night is getting ready. Obviously I would be better on the boulevards to watch the Parisiennes pass. It is true that then I would not realize my happiness! Let us comfort ourselves in food and the pinard.</p><p> </p><p> Where are the boxes? Where's my beef tongue in tomato sauce? Where is my tuna marinated in boiling oil? Where did my mortadella that I spread on my bread like a beautiful pink vaseline? Where then this precious wine, providence of the bushmen, in which one can soak indifferently his pen to write or his lips to drink? And my pig head cheese? And my rabbit bone cassoulet? What about my pound dog hams? Everything is gone. There you have it, Dark Magic!</p><p> </p><p> Incomprehensible! Madame Herriot only drank tea. Mme Paul Morand only drank tea. Morand drank like these ladies. What did they do with my sniff?</p><p> </p><p> What about the spoons, and the forks, and the plates?</p><p> </p><p> However, they ate neither iron nor porcelain. What about glass? What a stomach without seeming to!</p><p> </p><p> Not even a fishing rod that would allow me to search Niger for my food!</p><p> </p><p> They left me a knife, the sharpest, probably to allow me to put an end to my despair.</p><p> </p><p> Eminent ladies, illustrious friend, I had done nothing to you, however!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The laptots, on deck, were in the process of stuffing themselves with couscous. A negro eats like ten whites. During the time we swallow three shrimp, they send kilos of millet into the stomach. Tonight, to taunt me, they were eating even more! One ball did not wait for the other. They went there with both hands. "Let me taste your stuff," I said to the chef. He kneads a beautiful ball, very round, very dirty. I wiped it. " Well ! he said, good couscous! It couldn't pass. It was like sand sprayed with sweat. "Give a franc, tomorrow you will have chicken." »Tomorrow!</p><p> </p><p> I started the research again. Nothing under the bed, nothing on the ceiling. There was definitely onlythe walls to hit my head there. If my ungrateful companions had been there, I would have devoured them.</p><p> </p><p> I had my boy, but his body being probably as hard as his head, how would my teeth have come to grips with it?</p><p> </p><p> We went back down Niger accompanied by the trumpet birds.</p><p> </p><p> - Ti don't have a gun? asked the chief laptot. And he showed me ducks which, by the thousands, passed from one bank to another. It made me bitter at the moment: so many ducks in the sky and not a single one with peas!</p><p> </p><p> - Do you know Dadannelles? he continued.</p><p> </p><p> - Me, know Dardanelles.</p><p> </p><p> - Do you know Saint-Aphaël?</p><p> </p><p> - Me, knowing Saint-Raphaël.</p><p> </p><p> - You know Montauban?</p><p> </p><p> - Me, get to know Montauban.</p><p> </p><p> - You know everything! Do you also know my father and mother?</p><p> </p><p> He was a former sharpshooter.</p><p> </p><p> - How did you find France, I said to her, was it good or not good?</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! France, lots of nice shops, lots of light, lots of white ladies…</p><p> </p><p> He gargled with a big laugh.</p><p> </p><p> - Who called me my Mamadou, who gave gifts to me a lot!</p><p> </p><p> - Do you have love letters?</p><p> </p><p> They are not rare the skirmishers who lived the beautiful adventure. How many scented letters took the road to Africa after the war! Letters not coming out of the shallows, having style: À mon Mamadou! To my Samba! To my Galandou! To my darling Moussa. Ah! beautiful curious!</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, me have letters. You come to Koulikoro, show me them, to you.</p><p> </p><p> It was a question of going to Koulikoro! I was hungry. Suddenly an idea occurred to me. Either I was dreaming, which would have been allowed with such a wave in the stomach, or I had taken a non-commissioned officer to Kabara. However, there was no non-commissioned officer in the barge! Would they also have eaten it by TSF? He must have been in the machine. The two boats were brought closer. I stepped over. My man was sleeping on the pile of wood near the boiler, as if it had been very cold and we were on our way to hunt wolves.</p><p> </p><p> - Hey! I said to him, shaking him, I have nothing to eat.</p><p> </p><p> He woke up heavily.</p><p> </p><p> - Excuse me, he said, I'm not hungry, I drank too much.</p><p> </p><p> - You have a lot of luck!</p><p> </p><p> - It is, he said, that I come back from Araouan.</p><p> </p><p> He had provisions. The officialsused to travel slowly. In Africa, transport is officially in the same situation as thirty years ago, with, however, this difference that tugs are worn. To please travelers of choice, the administration has no other means than to borrow machines from private industry. The luxury passenger, well coaxed by the governor, will sing on his return to France the speed of transport in the wild country. He will sing it all the higher the better. Let's get out of the salamalecs, and we'll see that nothing is going around. On February 21, an assistant clerk arrived in Timbuktu; he had gone quickly, having left France on January 7! If I had not picked up the non-commissioned officer, he would have waited for another opportunity in Kabara. It takes officials almost a month to cover what normally in our time, we could do in a hundred hours. How much road allowance would we not save if we had steamers? But where did I get that we had to walk at full speed across Africa</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> - Araouan! repeated the non-commissioned officer seated now in front of me, Araouan! ...</p><p> </p><p> I ate his tuna cans, I crushed the rabbit bones of his cassoulet. I was drinking his black wine.</p><p> </p><p> - Me, he said, I took nineteen appetizers this afternoon, I'm no longer thirsty!</p><p> </p><p> - You are a distillery and not a non-commissioned officer!</p><p> </p><p> - I was coming from Araouan, you understand!</p><p> </p><p> I remembered reading this name on many graves in the Timbuktu cemetery.</p><p> </p><p> - So the wireless buddies from Kabara party when one of us comes back from Araouan. They know what it is, even those who have not been there.</p><p> </p><p> - Where is your Araouan?</p><p> </p><p> - Do I know? Six days higher than Timbuktu, in the Sahara.</p><p> </p><p> - And what are you doing there?</p><p> </p><p> - We're going to die, of course!</p><p> </p><p> - Besides that?</p><p> </p><p> - Besides that, we have a fever. I also did wireless there. But eat, drink, I have more than I need.</p><p> </p><p> He poured me a glass of wine.</p><p> </p><p> - Cheers ! Paul Morand.</p><p> </p><p> - What? he said.</p><p> </p><p> - Nothing.</p><p> </p><p> He waddled and, hitting his knees:</p><p> </p><p> - Araouan! Araouan! he said, thinking deeply.</p><p> </p><p> - How many of you were there?</p><p> </p><p> - There were ten of us right away.</p><p> </p><p> - Is there a village?</p><p> </p><p> - When he passes camels! We're here to chase after the rezzous. If only there was water in the well! Here ! I'm going to bed.</p><p> </p><p> The two barges were brought together. It was quite night. Upset by the maneuver, the Niger whistled like a spiky cat in front of a dog.</p><p> </p><p> -… Dianisèqué (hello), threw us the chief laptot.</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! old bambara! said the sub-off, stuffing his chest, old bambara! Yes I'm fine ? Your father is fine ?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Your mother is feeling well ?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, I'm fine.</p><p> </p><p> - Is your cow okay?</p><p> </p><p> "I'll give it back to Mopti," I shouted.</p><p> </p><p> He disappeared, rolling his shoulders and repeating:</p><p> </p><p> - Araouan! sacred Araouan! Not even water in the well!</p><p> </p><p> Farewell, Mopti! Farewell, Dienné, pretty girl from Sudan! Dienné where one remains astonished because of the squares, the streets, the one-story houses and the mosque that will be rebuilt at the colonial exhibition. At least I imagine it. What would Africa show at Vincennes if not the Dene mosque? Hello again, immense simplicity of the black country! Farewell ! San!</p><p> </p><p> What if I left my barge and found food? I think so ! I did all of this at Mopti. Even that I am sitting on my preserves So that they do not fly away any more. And I ride, I ride as if the region's lions without manes are all after me. Yet I only meet partridges and guinea fowl. Now that I don't need anything, the road is full of poultry!</p><p> </p><p> Ah! the beautiful roads! One can imagine nothing better. I am not joking. The roads are magnificent; rather ask the natives!They are all the more remarkable as they did not cost us a cowry.</p><p> </p><p> We only spent negro! So are we so poor in black Africa?</p><p> </p><p> Not at all ! The general government budget has a reserve fund of I do not know how many hundreds of millions! Reserve fund? Scandalous expression for a new country. The hundreds of millions, we should borrow them to enhance the country and not bury them in the old national woolen sock! It's a design that petrifies you. What is this reserve fund made of? By the receipts of the colonies which form the general government.</p><p> </p><p> There is another precision to be entered here. This is essential. There are French people who believe that the colonies cost the metropolis money. Not a bastard! They are richer than France, our colonies. You will say that this is not yet much. Come on, rue de Rivoli, ask the manager of the Ministry of Finance to show you his reserve fund!</p><p> </p><p> Our colonies live.</p><p> </p><p> They support thousands of French soldiers and civil servants.</p><p> </p><p> There is even one that pays a rent to France!</p><p> </p><p> That said, let's resume.</p><p> </p><p> We are currently in French West Africa. Eight colonies. Each has its budget. Where does the money come from? Tax paid by each negro and customs duty paid by everyone. Example: Dahomey, the smallest piece of this cake, admits sixty-two million recipes this year. They give him twenty million for his needs. Dakar (the general government) takes forty-two million. Same procedure for the other seven tranches.</p><p> </p><p> The colonies are not happy. They are right. They say they are the first to know their needs. Dahomey says that with the money it sends to Dakar the Dahomeans could afford beautiful wharfs, kilometers of railways and permanent facilities. So speak Sudan, Upper Volta, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Niger, Guinea. As for Mauritania, it does not speak, it runs!</p><p> </p><p> Dakar therefore takes the money:</p><p> </p><p> Dakar explains its appetite by a principle. Each colony, he says, is in solidarity with the others. With money from Dahomey, I will do work in Upper Volta that will serve Dahomey.Very logical. But there are principles like rabbit skins: it is for use that we see if the hairs hold!</p><p> </p><p> Up to this day, the hairs are flying away!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The most urgent work in this country would be to make negro.</p><p> </p><p> To use the official expression, black Africa is not a settlement. The white remains there temporarily only while being spared and definitively only in a coffin. If I were Governor General, I would hold up a huge calico on the cursed coast and I would have these words painted there: "White which makes an unnecessary effort will be immediately punished by nature." "</p><p> </p><p> The native is therefore essential to us.</p><p> </p><p> If not for love of neighbor, at least out of selfishness, we should watch over him as on a field of wheat.</p><p> </p><p> We mow it before it has grown its ear!</p><p> </p><p> The primary task of a commander is to save his men from death. Otherwise, from a commander, one becomes a guardian of the cemetery.</p><p> </p><p> Three hundred million in the reserve fund, but:</p><p> </p><p> nor a dump truck,</p><p> </p><p> nor a steam roller.</p><p> </p><p> Nothing but negroes and negresses, a stone on the head and a harlequin slat in hand!</p><p> </p><p> In Sudan, in Upper Volta, in Ivory Coast, in the whole pleiad, there are more than fifty thousand kilometers of roads. All the materials which were used to make them were carried on the head of the negro!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> What is the negro? The Negro is not a Turk, as they say. He is not strong. Black, in dye, is not a patent of solidity. Sometimes, in the camps, providers die as if they had an epidemic. On this subject, a grand sentence; it is taken from an official report. It reads: "The inconceivable fragility of the natives ..." You have to see them when it rains. They walk shriveled, as if under the influence of a violent colic, with small leaping steps, the two arms crossed on their chest, right hand holding the left shoulder, left hand holding the right shoulder. And the evenings? It is not always hot; they cough like in a sanatorium. Those who have a foulbrood carefully stick it on their back. This does not prevent them from shivering, in the company of the less wealthy,</p><p> </p><p> We act as if they were oxen. Alladministrator will tell you that babywearing is the bane of Africa. This knocks out the child, shakes the young black, decays the adult. It is the stupidity of woman and man. White supported a thesis. He said, “We force them to make roads; it is for their good; the portage kills them; the roads made, they will not carry any more. "</p><p> </p><p> They are still wearing!</p><p> </p><p> Where we should work to populate, we are depopulating. Are we the woodcutters of the human forest?</p><p> </p><p> Where did this method take us?</p><p> </p><p> To a dreadful situation.</p><p> </p><p> For three years :</p><p> </p><p> 1º Six hundred thousand natives left for Gold Coast (English colony);</p><p> </p><p> 2º Two million natives left for Nigeria (English colony);</p><p> </p><p> 3. Ten thousand natives live outside the villages, in the wild (wilder!) In the forests of Côte d'Ivoire.</p><p> </p><p> They flee :</p><p> </p><p> 1 ° Recruitment for the army;</p><p> </p><p> 2 ° Recruitment for roads or machines (railways);</p><p> </p><p> 3 ° The individual recruitment of wood cutters.</p><p> </p><p> It's the exodus!</p><p> </p><p> So we arrive in Upper Volta, in the Mossi country. It is known in Africa as the reservoir of men: three million negroes. Everyone comes to get it like water from the well. During the Thiès-Kayes and Kayes-Niger railways, we typed in the Mossi. The Ivory Coast, for its railroad, taps in the Mossi. The wood cutters come up from the lagoon and hit the Mossi.</p><p> </p><p> And we are surprised that Sudan and Upper Volta do not yet produce cotton!</p><p> </p><p> Trucks and steam rollers!</p><p> </p><p> Here are a thousand negroes in single file, barda on the head, who are going to the machine! to the Ivory Coast Railway at Tafiré. Seven hundred kilometers. The living ? We will find them on the way, please God! The caravan will take a month to reach the site. How docile is the step of slaves! Men will stay on the way, the welding will be done quickly; we'll tighten the queue.</p><p> </p><p> We could transport them by truck; we would gain twenty days, surely twenty lives. Buy trucks? use tires? burn gasoline? The reserve fund would lose weight! The negro is still quite fat!</p><p> </p><p> Ouagadougou!</p><p> </p><p> Hold ! I would prefer not to tell you about this city. The bold builders to whom we owe it supposed that there would be a hundred thousand inhabitants, one day, in Ouagadougou. Two hundred thousand, maybe? Does the French see little? In France, certainly; in Africa, it is catching up.</p><p> </p><p> It is not a city, it is a field of maneuvers. We imagine it very well in the grip of cavalry charges. Horses, moreover, even wearing a helmet, would never arrive at the end of the avenue: they would collapse in the middle, their sides throbbing like a bellows.</p><p> </p><p> This is where you have to go.</p><p> </p><p> When I say that we are traveling in Ouagadougou, I am laughing at you. Three hundred Europeans live there, I was told. Where were they</p><p> </p><p> Wider, longer than the Champs-Élysées, an alley cuts the burning bush in half. On each side, twin and blackish buildings meet. They are palaces… palaces of mud.</p><p> </p><p> The aspect is so attractive that one must hold back so as not to cry for help</p><p> </p><p> Here, in a corner, lives the last negro king, the Morho Naba, Emperor of the Mossis.</p><p> </p><p> In 1920, we erected the Mossi country as an independent colony. We cut Haut-Sénégal and Niger in two. Thus were born Sudan and Upper Volta.</p><p> </p><p> The love of euphony did not only guide us when we installed the capital in Ouagadougou, but also the presence of Morho Naba. Ouagadougou is a city in the moon. It's on the road to nothing at all. The capital was marked in advance. She even had a name that was worth the other: Bobo-Dioulasso! We preferred to have our noses in the air!</p><p> </p><p> So let's sniff. We will not have time, we will have day and night. O nights of Ouagadougou! I was staying in a palace, like everyone else, one of these brand new mud palaces. I would have been careful not to send the photograph of my home to my friends, they would have thought that I had made a fortune in cotton or shea butter! It was not a passing house, a polluted, poorly kept caravanserai, but theremains of the Secretary General, no more! An ignorant traveler would have taken me for the second character of the kingdom, perhaps for the great eunuch!</p><p> </p><p> I came back to bed. Immediately I understood what a grain chicken put in the oven could feel. As the sponge drinks water, mud drinks heat. My walls had been drinking all day. Saturated, they emerged inside my home. Bah! I said, in Paris too it is a hammam! And I lay in the kapok. But now everything was moving between the mud on the ceiling and the mud on the floor; the big bat tournament was starting. I pulled them with my pillow, my bolster, my shoes. I have broken wings! If you need a bat hunter, send me your conditions; you will not find a better trained specialist! It would take less to wake up a man. I would then sit in a colonial chair and read the latest wireless. Vlan! Pieces of ceiling fell on my head! No matter how hard your head is, you never know if the thickness of your skull is legal, as one day said the English, in Egypt, to the Italian consul, about one of their police officers who had knocked out a transalpine! So I was styling my helmet.In the tropics, I was arming myself against the midnight sun! But the ? What is the thing that quivers? It's my pants! He was dragging on the ground, the termites were making lint, probably to heal my wound! I was fighting against termites. If you need a termite hunter ... Finally we ended up getting used to bats, termites, bombing. The soul was reassured when suddenly a cry took you from your chair. She was the hyena of every night. I went out on the veranda, and threw: “I already told you yesterday that there was no chicken or corpse at my house; go see elsewhere! She was leaving. The militiaman who slept outside my door woke up. Laughing, he said to me: “Crocuta! At first, I thought he was insulting me. More knowledgeable than me,</p><p> </p><p> So happened in the morning. Poor settlers, my brothers!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The Mossi! Uncommon kingdom. Who will claim to know a country where the inhabitants are more polite? Here are two natives carrying a heavy and fragile load on their heads; they will cross; suddenly they recognize themselves; everyone immediately drops their load in the middle of the street; the youngest jumps to the ground, the other imitates him.Face to face, they rub their forehead in the dust, then, elbows apart and thumbs up, they strike the ground with their forearms, not three times, as I was led to believe, but for a minute, watch in hand! They are pushing  !</p><p> </p><p> What about weddings? It is of all kinds.</p><p> </p><p> There is the marriage of girls born to a naba. They are the properties of the latter. Abducted from their parents, as soon as they can render a service, the naba entrusts them to his wives. These are the chef's fiancées, his little change, if one can say, which he distributes as tips to the friendly passers-by.</p><p> </p><p> There is the daughter's marriage given by her parents, just as the farmers at our house give chickens to their owner. Throughout Africa, women have no other value than that of an object. We do not recognize any will. She is promised from birth and even before. Hospitality received, a debt to be reimbursed, an evening when the father drank too much dolo (millet beer) decide his future. At twelve, she was sent without further form to the home of the one who won it. He is sometimes older than the father.</p><p> </p><p> There is marriage by inheritance. The head of the family dies, his wives follow the fate of his other property. They go to whom go the cows. Yesit is her children, the mother becomes the wife of her children.</p><p> </p><p> There is regular marriage. As with us, the fiancé sends an intermediary. Is the answer favorable? We offer an engagement ring. The negro brings a hen, a secco (a blind), a bundle of wood. The visits continue; he does not send flowers, but sprouted millet. Misfortune ! when his bride is the eldest of the family, he also has a sheep, a pickaxe, a guinea fowl ...</p><p> </p><p> There are girls condemned to celibacy by order of the diviner. To obey the gods, the parents do not betroth her, they get along with the lover. One evening the girl goes to the well, one evening when it is very dark. The lover and three of his strongest comrades are carpet like panthers. As soon as the girl appears, they jump on her.</p><p> </p><p> Too bad if they knock it out! Delighted, she is taken to the man who wants her. It's finish. The gods have nothing to say.</p><p> </p><p> Then there is the nomadic woman, who goes from village to village, asking for hospitality. The good news is spreading: a free woman is at Un Tel! Young people come running with gifts. It designates the winner.</p><p> </p><p> The ceremonies accomplished, the woman becomes a workhorse. She is only allowed to hit the stick. Her husband sends her to hit the roads for him. She carries the furniture, while the male, on his horse, leaves, puzzle on the shoulder and bow in hand. The husband only recognizes that he has the right to shout. "The woman's mouth," he says, "is his only quiver. She has nothing else to defend herself. "It must be for this reason that I often heard complaints?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Witch doctors, magicians, sorcerers, bewitchers have a good career in this country. Man is made up of three elements: body, sega (soul) and kima (ghost), you can think if the joyful conjurers play ghost! I saw him well one afternoon when I wanted to be taken to the house of a man named Jacob, who, it seems, was carving small, just-suitable subjects. The unqualified interpreter showed me the way, but did not want to accompany me. "I'll pay you dolo," I said to him; Come with me, I will never find Jacob's hut on my own. So he told me about his father's kima. The wizard had warned him that his father's ghost was in Jacob's neighborhood. "Don't be afraid," I insisted, "I'm a great warrior; if the ghost approaches, I kill him. "He tells me that the kimawould make the hair stand on "his" head and give him great chills. "I have quinine," I replied, "and I will flatten your mop; come with me. He told me that his father was so mean that his ghost would certainly snatch his sega (his soul) from him. "This is not what will keep you from drinking dolo." Come on! He replied that he could live, indeed, several days without his soul; but that if his absence continued, he would die. “You know very well that I must see the Morho Naba tomorrow; I will tell him that he will make you give up your soul if the kima takes it from you. "</p><p> </p><p> He seemed convinced. For two hundred meters, he accompanied me. Suddenly, he ran off, his hair standing on end. He told me later that it was the effect of kima. I assumed it was that of the wind of flight!</p><p> </p><p> What about burials?</p><p> </p><p> One day, an already stiff dead man was standing against a tree, both feet in a canary. The two feet in the canary intrigued me. It was a Lobi custom. It seems that animal heat persists longer when you have both feet in a canary! Members of the family mouched the stencil with oxtails. The friends were dancing, the women were singing. We brought two chickens, which grewthey too were heartbreaking cries, seeing that their necks were cut off.</p><p> </p><p> The fate of the chickens made me think. I went away.</p><p> </p><p> Another time I saw a dead man, but lying in a grave. It was a mossi funeral. The parents threw cowries on the body to allow him to buy water when he was thirsty and to pay the rights of way on the road to eternity. The laghda (the gravedigger) filled the pit. When the work was done, he spoke. The family nodded approvingly.</p><p> </p><p> "Accept these cowries," he said to the dead, "don't waste them. Be sober, reasonable. Don't let your kima prowl, go and join your ancestors right away in Pilimpikou (village where you meet dead parents). You have walked enough. Above all, don't come back, because what you leave on earth benefits your heirs.</p><p> </p><p> Tranquilized, the heirs left.</p><p> </p><p> Friday morning. The endless, shadowless and merciless alley of Ouagadougou is empty. It is empty as it is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Sunday, not only in the morning, but in the afternoon, in the evening, at night. Fascinated by the sun, she sleeps.</p><p> </p><p> It will soon be ten o'clock. Over there, at the bottom, fifteen hundred meters away, a dust rises from the road, marches, approaches. A compact group emerges. We see men on horseback, others on foot. The vision becomes clearer. People on foot gesture like mechanical scarecrows. They can only chase away evil spirits, since there is no one outside them. They shout. Music escapes from tinplate instruments. The drum skins resonate under nervous hands. An umbrella dominates the cavalcade.</p><p> </p><p> Friday ? That's right, the Morho Naba isgoes to the governor's house to present his weekly greetings.</p><p> </p><p> His (cute) soronés run before him. The Bindi Naba, minister of musicians, activates the enthusiasm of the performers. The Ouidi Naba, grand master of the cavalry, heads the royal mount. This naba does not lack work: a large negro dressed like an ostrich makes so many faces that the horse is frightened; it is Pouy Naba, head of the witch doctors. Here's one I should hire to hunt my bats! Riding two strides behind the sovereign, comes the Tapsebo Naba, war chief. He is in the saddle on a panther skin. Four gallops surround him with four spears. But why does a dog follow him so obediently? The poor beast is tied to the tail of his horse! It must represent the priest. Before the swarming procession, the Ouagadougou Naba, prefect of police, hawk's eye.</p><p> </p><p> Her Majesty is under the umbrella, a cotton umbrella with two whales piercing the dome. Her name is Naba Kôm, head of water, and She fears the rain! At sight, She weighs more than her horse. It looks like Sancho Pança blackened by the sun and looking for his boss gone to deliver the negro. Proud is his look.</p><p> </p><p> There is Nemdo Naba, chief of meat; theLarallé Naba, responsible for choosing the victims for the royal graves. I hide behind a mango tree. The Ouedranga Naba, personal squire.</p><p> </p><p> The court has passed. The dust settles. Who comes, poking a brilliant hundred yards? Another one who was not ready at the time of departure! How he runs! Nothing bothers him, of course! outside of his boubou. It is the Kamoro Naba, the great eunuch. Is the fire in the harem?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Naba Kôm is not a wren. He is the last emperor of Africa. Out of three million inhabitants in Mossi country, fifteen hundred thousand followed him. The label of his court is rigorous. In the morning, at seven o'clock, a shot was fired; the Morho Naba wakes up. If he opens his eye earlier, too bad For him, he will stay in bed. Soronés, women and nabas come running. Tam Tam. In music, he wears a red dress and quickly leaves the palace. Ouedranga Naba, his squire, holds a horse by the bridle, all saddled. His Majesty rushes to the beast, shouting: "I want to go to Lâ! I want to go to Lâ! His first wife, the Pugtiema, hands him a basket, his supplies to Lâ. But the Kansoro Naba is approaching (I cannot tell you what this naba does, I have itforgot, you will forgive me; but I think he has no other job), approaches and says:</p><p> </p><p> - Sire, order that we unsaddle your horse; you will go tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p> Going to Lâ means going to war against the Morho Naba of Ouhahigouya, his eternal enemy. Naba Kôm lets go of the strap, frowns. The courtyard flattens. He stamps his foot twice, blows up the Pugtiema basket with a powerful fist, and, violently angry, cursing the cowards who prevent him from accomplishing his duty, he rushes back into his palace.</p><p> </p><p> His soronés follow him. They are young boys, from eight to fifteen years old, chosen from among the prettiest. They have, among other tasks, that of pouring him a drink, moving his cushion, his mat, carrying his umbrella (they may well cover it), his saber, holding stirrups, leading visitors, and younger, to sleep at the palace. Styled like women, they wear the same big copper bracelets like their wrists and ankles. They are forbidden to hang out with women. Each year, Pouy Naba, the sorcerer chief, imposes on them, as well as on women, the calabash test. Depending on how the face is reflected in the water, women and soronés are declared innocent or guilty. The fickle are put to death. We ban this test, but are we still here?</p><p> </p><p> Sorones and musicians do not leave His Majesty. They are, day and night, attentive to his gestures. No one is speaking. The voice should not be raised in the presence of the king. Deeply bowed, everyone receives his orders. If the king drinks, the soronés rub their hands noisily, and the music plays. If he coughs, if he blows his nose, if he sneezes, if he spits, if his stomach, going up to his throat, expresses the contentment of a too good dinner, the soronés snap their fingers and violins accompany him!</p><p> </p><p> So until the evening ... At sunset appears the Baloum Naba, a steward, carrying a gourd. Tilted in front of the palace door, it offers a libation of water to the royal gri-gri. Then he lights the night fire.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Two forty-five. Xavier, the interpreter, is not there. As long as he hasn't met his father's ghost? The Morho Naba is waiting for me. He had dolo bought at the market, in my honor. Xavier is not there. Three hours. I'm leaving alone.</p><p> </p><p> Enhance the colonies? I want it a lot ; but, in some places, it would have to start at the beginning. Here, for example, we don'twill do nothing until we say to the sun, "Look, this can't last; you burn the earth, you pump out the cerebral matter of men, you prevent dogs from barking… Come a little, we will show you off! A bill on the development of the sun in Africa is necessary. This is my opinion by walking to the Morho Naba!</p><p> </p><p> I will be late. I would tell him a lie to apologize; but do you see that he subjects me to the calabash test? Xavier, you're not serious! You were, however, brought up among missionaries; you are catholic. It is true that you also go to the witch doctor. How do you want to be on time?</p><p> </p><p> The palace is in sight: a large mud building that we had built for the sovereign. I see it teeming with a crazy world. These people will not understand my speech.</p><p> </p><p> I arrive. I courageously walk through the door. Two commensals throw themselves belly on the ground and make me push-push . I hesitate to return politeness to them. It takes a long habit to strike your forearms properly against the ground, thumbs up! I always lift my thumbs; perhaps they will understand the intention? I walk to the big steps. But here is the other, the sorcerer chief, the one who scares me with his feathers! I do notdon't want to say hello, I'm lowering my thumbs. It doesn't upset him; he plays rooster in front of me. I step on the first step. Has my foot touched a doorbell? Immediately the court came out en masse, king in mind, and aligned itself on the fifth step. Here I am pretty! Fortunately the musicians start the tom-tom. I'm going straight to the king. I stick my hand in hers. I said to him, "Is your father okay? Your mother is feeling well ? Is your horse okay? »Perhaps he answers me:« And your sister? She is fine ? "</p><p> </p><p> You have to enter the throne room.</p><p> </p><p> Naba Kôm is clothed in a levite of velvet, bound in lamé, glittery and flowery wine. He has, at the very least, eight pounds on his shoulders. He must bless me! Her thighs are surely enormous; he walks like an elephant. His throne is raised. He wins it, sits down. The soronés surround him; the musicians take their places. Baloum Naba makes me put on a chair below. We are now face to face. We look at each other. We look smart!</p><p> </p><p> Without worrying about Her Majesty, I pass the inspection of the throne room. It is decorated with four old newspaper photographs. We see General Dodds entering Abomey, the degradation of Dreyfus, the looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the murder of Sadi Carnot. The otheron the side, a bat placed crosswise against the wall. There is one who knows how to talk to bats!</p><p> </p><p> Suddenly, the king makes a noise. The music plays, the soronés snap their fingers. I cast a severe eye on the sovereign. He doesn't care. He pats his velvet dress while thinking, "Is he going to go away soon, that moron? "</p><p> </p><p> I should tell him something:</p><p> </p><p> - Is the dolo good this year, sire?</p><p> </p><p> He moves in his wicker chair, causing a new noise. Immediately a balafon!</p><p> </p><p> Sweating, the flanks cut, breathless, this is Xavier.</p><p> </p><p> - Look in what situation you put me, I said.</p><p> </p><p> His forehead was already in the dust, flapping his forearms like a winged chicken.</p><p> </p><p> - Have you met Daddy's ghost again? Ah! you make a pretty coconut! You were hanging out in the market, weren't you? When will you get it in your head to watch the time on your watch? You never consult the hands, but the case, on the pretext that it is brighter. Become reasonable, come on! you already have a helmet, glasses ...</p><p> </p><p> The king was tapping his dress more and more.</p><p> </p><p> - That is true ! I said. We are there to deal with our small business… Tell the king that I thank him and that he is a chic guy.</p><p> </p><p> The water chief looked happy. He groaned kindly. A balafon!</p><p> </p><p> - It's hot ! I cried.</p><p> </p><p> - Take off your jacket, Xavier tells me.</p><p> </p><p> - Are you crazy ? At the king's?</p><p> </p><p> It was done, it seems. I took off my jacket.</p><p> </p><p> For a while now, the Binda Naba, seated in front of a drum, had been running his thumb over the skin of an ox, and it was reminiscent of the noise of a bus passing by.</p><p> </p><p> - Why is he doing this, Xavier?</p><p> </p><p> - He imitates the roar of the lion.</p><p> </p><p> - Is it to make me leave?</p><p> </p><p> - It's to honor you.</p><p> </p><p> - Ask the king if he would like to come to the colonial exhibition in Paris?</p><p> </p><p> - He says that he has no right to leave his States, but that last year he went to Dakar and that it rained all the same and that, therefore, he would be fine in Paris.</p><p> </p><p> - Tell him he's a great psychologist.</p><p> </p><p> Xavier translated. The Morho Naba looked less cheerful.</p><p> </p><p> - What did you say to him? He doesn't seem happy.</p><p> </p><p> - I couldn't translate psychologist; I said to him: "You are a big rogue! "</p><p> </p><p> His Majesty made a sign. The courtiers, sprawled at his feet, rose. I thought She was angry. She only ordered the dolo. Two soronés, his cute favorites, appeared glasses in hand. The king took his, I took mine. The glass had barely touched the royal lips when triumphant music filled the air. He lowered the glass. The music fell silent. So I also wanted to have my triumph. I drank. Silence. I reject. No drum, no snapping fingers, no balafon! I drank everything, down to the fly that was at the bottom! It didn't affect them. Not the faintest breath of a child. These people cannot honor courage!</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! tell him I'm going!</p><p> </p><p> This time Xavier spoke in French. What he was going to say, all the negroes, from top to bottom, could understand it:</p><p> </p><p> - Sire! the white f ... his camp!</p><p> </p><p> I then saw the royal face which smiled.</p><p> </p><p> The White ?</p><p> </p><p> Mute Africa is just a soccer field.</p><p> </p><p> Two teams, always the same, both white.</p><p> </p><p> One wears the colors of the administration.</p><p> </p><p> The other the colors of the businessman.</p><p> </p><p> The negro makes the ball.</p><p> </p><p> The fight around the ball is fierce.</p><p> </p><p> The white of the administration protects the negro against the white of business, but uses it for his own account.</p><p> </p><p> The whites of business accuse the whites of the administration of doing precisely with the negro everything that others are prohibited from doing.</p><p> </p><p> The administrator processes the merchant of margouillat.</p><p> </p><p> The margouillat is a small lizard which has suckers on its legs, constantly dies of hungry and snatches all the mosquitoes in the air.</p><p> </p><p> The merchant says of the administrator that he is Denys the Elder, tyrant of Syracuse.</p><p> </p><p> The administrator says that, without him, the trader would strip the negro. The merchant replies that if the administrator forbids him to strip the negro, it is because he takes care of it himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I arrived at Bobo-Dioulasso. It was not a small residence camped in the bush. Bobo-Dioulasso is a crossroads of Africa knotting the Sudan, the Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast. Old negro cubbyhole, where in an astonishing district the streets are not in front of the houses, but inside. They go from the kitchen of one to the bedroom of the other. People would only be at home by their window if there were windows! This urban design is magnificent. The spouses no longer have to ask themselves the sad question: Are we going out? Are we going back?</p><p> </p><p> We are both out and about, outside and at home, and even though we spend all our nights on the public highway, we never sleep!</p><p> </p><p> The blood boiling with just indignation, the apostrophe on the lips, the heart in tears, I watched, furious, the women on trays. Rather, thiswere not trays. A large piece of quartz plugging a hole distorted the lower lip. When the quartz was removed, we could see either the tongue or the saliva sliding through the orifice. It was disgusting. A little aesthetic, Gentlemen Governors! A woman is a woman, what the devil! We respect their customs, you say? Ouiche! As long as they don't bother us. We have done many others! We forbid them to give their captives to the caiman, on the pretext that it is sacred, and to kill the servants to keep the dear dead company, so why allow them to change their wives into ducks?</p><p> </p><p> So I was in this famous Bobo-Dioulasso, when four white men threw themselves on me. The administrator accompanied me; they separated me and said to me: "We want to talk to you ... will you allow me?" They said, over my shoulder, to the official. The other raised both hands, in complete disinterestedness. "We are delegated by the merchants of Bobo," said my attackers.</p><p> </p><p> I gave them an appointment for five hours.</p><p> </p><p> - So, I said to the commander, here, it's like everywhere, you eat your liver?</p><p> </p><p> The liver and the nose. They devoured each other. Administrator blamed himself for not having a prisonlarge enough to accommodate some traders on their merits.</p><p> </p><p> - You are like your colleague from Houndé, who demands a tamer instead of a governor. Do you also fly the black flag with a skull on your residence?</p><p> </p><p> Yesterday, in Houndé, I saw this emblem beat at the door of the Maison de France. It was the famous flag of the coast brothers. It should be known that one indicates, by there, the wrecks, the adventurers, the nomads, all the men with spot, rolled by the foam to the hot banks of Africa. The administrator thus intended to honor his compatriots. This representative of authority was also a phenomenon. The day before my departure, had he not sent the following telegram to the governor:</p><p> </p><p> "Governor, I am the sickest man we have ever seen. This morning, at the cotton market, I am weighing myself on the scale of a trader. It was ten o'clock, the scale weighed seventy-five kilos. An hour later, I come back, I get on the same scale. Horror! I only weighed fifty kilos. The loss of twenty-five kilos in one hour seems to me a sufficient fact to request your convalescence leave! "</p><p> </p><p> Ah! brilliant Huchart, Huchart of death,as we call you, thanks be to you: fantasy is not entirely dead in the colonies!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Five hours. I arrive at the meeting. In a courtyard, in front of a new house, eighteen Frenchmen, in picnic, that is to say, each wearing a white and starched costume.</p><p> </p><p> What men are they?</p><p> </p><p> Neither lazy nor shy. Chicken blood does not flow through their veins. They are more warm-blooded than cold-blooded. These are men who crossed the seas to make a fortune.</p><p> </p><p> Some have already done it, they have lost it, they are looking for it. The others are in the middle of the game: heads or tails? Here are the young people in "consumption", sons of families who were familiar with the heritage, and whom the parents, for training, sent to the country of the rabid cow. Nice teeth! beautiful carnivores!… All attack.</p><p> </p><p> The merchants do me the honor of the house. The traveller's champagne refreshes in the buckets. The seats are prepared. We take place.</p><p> </p><p> One puts his chair forward and says:</p><p> </p><p> - I'm Prétefort. They call me Gueulefort; not everyone can speak at once. Iwill speak for all. First, how are you? If you are sick, we will treat you. We are sometimes well, sometimes bad; but we still go. Do you know where you are? In the middle ages. If you get in trouble with us, and your head does not return to the administrator, you will only have to sleep outside and eat winged ants. The native chiefs for the negroes, the European chiefs for the whites reign from the top of a castle.</p><p> </p><p> It does not go well. Recruitment for the army depopulates our colonies. There are countless deserted villages. Our frightened workforce flees among the English. When the skirmishers leave, they are gentle and naive; they are thugs on their return.</p><p> </p><p> We make the negroes vote. I bet you four elephant points against a guinea fowl that soon Sudan, the Ivory Coast and the rest will each send a deputy to the Seine. That day, the French on the coast will be able to swim, and we will be able to bury ourselves in a termite hill.</p><p> </p><p> Instead of making mechanics, blacksmiths, carpenters, we make Akaouès , intellectuals who, believing the king of France dead, take the Republic for his widow and call gentlemen, the Lighthouses of the Bastille!</p><p> </p><p> Our laws, which already do not suit us, are going to the negro quite badly. The colonial judiciary, so shamefully paid that it is forced to feed on pig banana peelings, has become the stronghold of half-breeds and pure blacks. The sessions at the Palais de Justice are performances of a great circus ... Our children go there to laugh and cry when we deprive them ...</p><p> </p><p> The speaker was then arrested in his pleasant speech.</p><p> </p><p> "Talk about our business," shouted a colleague.</p><p> </p><p> - I come to it: Our ways of looking at the economic problem are opposed to official ideas. In a word, the official considers the merchant as a thief.</p><p> </p><p> - Like an intruder, an adventurer, launches another.</p><p> </p><p> - No ! I said, like a starving man only, a margouillat, at most. Your dream, incidentally, is on your face, it is not shameful, you want to make a fortune.</p><p> </p><p> - Yes ! they all replied.</p><p> </p><p> - But in two years and on the skin of the negro.</p><p> </p><p> - O unhappy sir! Fourteen years that I drag fevers, bilious, ticks, cro-cro, poto-poto, from Ivory Coast to termite mounds of Sudan. Fourteen years ...</p><p> </p><p> He was interrupted again. One of the eighteen got up.</p><p> </p><p> - In two years, you say, and why not?</p><p> </p><p> - Shut up ! said a comrade, you scare me, hide your teeth. We are not here to make art, it is understood, nor to help the negro to gain paradise. However, each of us is an honest man. And here is what I have to say to you: the administrator wants to take advantage of the negro, but he does not want us to take advantage of it. He says: "There, you will pay the cotton 90 cents, there 2 fr. 40. "</p><p> </p><p> "But," said I, "where you pay cotton 18 sous, the negro would sell it for 2 fr. 50 to his fellow citizens; where you pay it 2 fr. 40, the local weaver would buy it 4 fr. 50. You know very well that the Negro is forced to make cotton and sell it to you, and that in the end he scarcely gets anything but manigolo shots. If the price was not fixed, you would buy the cotton at the chicotte. It was seen, huh? and even can still be seen. And you're rocking.</p><p> </p><p> They all laughed.</p><p> </p><p> - The rocking blow? This is our response to the fixed price. 90 cents? Go for 18 sous! But the state of the market in France commands us to buy it for 14 cents. The seesaw makes the justice of the peace.</p><p> </p><p> - Come, I tell them, and the negro?</p><p> </p><p> - The negro? Let the administration begin. For her, the negro is never tired. He will cross the country on foot, he will lose weight on the roads, he will die with a machine . For us, just if it does not ask us to transport it in a hammock! She plundered him with requisitions. You know it well ... The administration strips the native; but since the native must have money to pay his taxes, it allows us to buy him what he does not take. Is it true ? Yes or no ?</p><p> </p><p> A silencer was revealed. Standing up, the accusing gesture: "Yes! let it begin! cried he. On what law does she rely to pay her chickens with cowry handles, which immediately makes 10 sous, while for us it is 10 francs; to requisition butter, milk, snake skins and panther skins? Try to buy a panther skin! Offer 200 francs, the hunter will refuse you, he will take it to the commander, who will give him 20 francs, and the guy will be happy.</p><p> </p><p> "The administrator is not paid enough," I said. His English and Belgian colleagues touch four times more, you cannot blame him for driving his house with economy.</p><p> </p><p> - If the Republic allows them to make savings on the negro, that it does not prevent us, us, from doing business.</p><p> </p><p> - Hey! I said, the negro is not so fat already; if you work together, it will soon be flat like a thumbtack!</p><p> </p><p> We drank a glass of Champagne then Prêtefort dit Gueulefort exclaimed:</p><p> </p><p> - Do you know what the administrator did to me the day before yesterday? He beat tom-tom three hours in a row, under the windows of my dying wife. Well ! Do you know what I'm going to do? He is not the only one to have negroes to his devotion, I will have him grabbed by my Kroumen, tie up, and I will send him to Ouagadougou, with a sign on his stomach where, on his arrival, the governor will be able to read :</p><p> </p><p> "There is nothing we can do with it, maybe you can get something out of it." "</p><p> </p><p> So !</p><p> </p><p> O whites! my brothers !</p><p> </p><p> Lunch in Houndé, in the Maison de France, stop in the middle of the bush. It is quiet. There, two months ago, the white man and the white woman, hosts of this lonely place, killed themselves to kill themselves. No jealousy, no loss of honor, no suffering to appease, no motive. Only the call of the bitterest land. Both obeying the voice that Africa, from time to time, takes to enjoin white, the woman went to bed for the sole purpose of being killed, the man killed and then killed himself. The boy says that in the morning he found the commander and Madame commander very, very sick. They had been dead for six hours. The hyena had spoken a lot that night!</p><p> </p><p> Dinner at Banfora. Here, in this residence, the drama is only three weeks old. The captain slept under his mosquito net. It was one a.m. The dagger of a negro suddenly crossed the mosquito net and the commander's chest.</p><p> </p><p> Revenge of a chef who delegated his estafier. A black man is in prison, but is he the right one?</p><p> </p><p> The palms of the palm grove sway gently.</p><p> </p><p> Here is Bouaké. We are in Ivory Coast. A whole village, bags on their heads, children in their backs, is marching towards the cotton market.</p><p> </p><p> Where is he from ? I do not know. How did he get off the road? Here it is: Bouaké's commander sent him a skirmisher.</p><p> </p><p> - Come on! Come on! Swarm, heap of savages! (You can hear that the skirmisher is a black like the others, but he speaks on behalf of the authority.) Ten tonnes of cotton for Bouaké market! Four days to pick it up; two days to bring him grouillez, fanants (lazy)!</p><p> </p><p> Thereupon, whistling the manigolo, the rifleman went to settle in the chief's hut. He asked the most beautiful wench and drink and eat. With an authority that makes him the equal of the ancient Negro kings, he confuses in his brain the powers he represents with those he gives himself. He drank, ate, raped, changed his wife.These singles sport their majesty so bluntly on their faces that several days later we laugh again. I saw one, two legs square, standing and motionless and speaking in a thunderous voice in the middle of a village, when there was no longer a cat around him. "Faster ... Run ... Service-service! ..." he said.</p><p> </p><p> - Who you address you?</p><p> </p><p> He clicked his kneecaps and replied with deep gravity:</p><p> </p><p> - Order my Commander!</p><p> </p><p> Today, cotton carriers are hurrying towards Bouaké. They range from not consenting. Crushed under load, they smile at you. The rifleman makes the sheepdog. The man, the mousso, the child, everyone is on duty. They will not see their four-day huts again, but they will contemplate the captain's face! Those who bring bad cotton will, as expected, catch a few days of "box". They hurry up !</p><p> </p><p> The city is reached. They rush into the courtyard of the residence, put down their bags, open them and put away. The sharpshooter admire his work, and not an official, won the office of the god of the bush. It freezes under the door and out to the fez, launches a voice of thunder:</p><p> </p><p> - Commander! Cotton is aboulé!</p><p> </p><p> Then begins the reception ceremony. The commander leaves; he searches every bag.</p><p> </p><p> - Atakoué! he said. Atakoué! it's good ! it's good ! will weigh.</p><p> </p><p> The happy go to the controlled scale .</p><p> </p><p> - Go sort! he said to that one in an angry tone.</p><p> </p><p> The man withdraws, empties his bag and separates the good from the bad.</p><p> </p><p> - To the box! suddenly exclaims the commander. To the box! he also said to the next.</p><p> </p><p> The cotton of these two is not pretty, they go to the box alone. Do they understand that it is due to them?</p><p> </p><p> At the scale we do the accounts. Today, cotton will sell for two francs forty. The writer traces on a small paper: 26 kilos at 2 fr. 40 = 62 fr. 40. This is the sum that the buyer will have to pay them. Confidence reigns!</p><p> </p><p> The rifleman stands in the middle of the yard, seeming to be waiting for something.</p><p> </p><p> - Sanna! said the commander to him, you have worked well; you will get fifty francs gratuity.</p><p> </p><p> The fifty francs must make him happy, but it is above all honor that transports Sanna suddenly. His heart goes up to his face and his two cheeks beat!</p><p> </p><p> - Thank you, Commander! he yells. Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you !</p><p> </p><p> Now the negroes are leaving for the city to sell their business. In the Allée des Margouillats, the traders are in front of their counters. They ironic mine. They seem to be saying, "Do you see how the administration treats white people?" They are not allowed to track. The black clerk who ran after the seller would go to the box. But they are allowed to call.</p><p> </p><p> - Hep! Hep! Come here ! Sixty-two francs forty? make a blank, I give you sixty-four francs. Sell ​​me your bag.</p><p> </p><p> The negro is fleeing. He wants sixty-two forty and not sixty-four.</p><p> </p><p> Is there a better animal on earth?</p><p> </p><p> I was going to the wood cutters. The Ivory Coast forest was even lower. But the recruitment of the workforce was made up here. For railways and state works, recruitment is official; it is only tolerated for wood cutters. It is one of the dramas of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> - This role breaks my heart, said a commander.</p><p> </p><p> (The administrators are divided: those who are willing to help recruit cutters and those who oppose it.)</p><p> </p><p> - I'm against it. This year, despite the orders, I did not give any man for the forest. It is slavery, no more no less. I refuse to be a slave trader.</p><p> </p><p> How is it going?</p><p> </p><p> Simply. The governor of the Colony warns the administrator of the Circle by telegraph that Mr. Chêne, a wood cutter, is authorized torecruit three hundred men from his home. M. Chêne arrives.</p><p> </p><p> If the administrator has no personal ideas on the matter, he says to his interpreter, "Go to the villages and tell the chiefs that I need three hundred men." The interpreter leaves and makes the commission. He said no more, but the chefs "know the way". They know that if the commander does not have his three hundred men, they will go to the box. So they give them - captives, of course.</p><p> </p><p> Is the administrator off-putting? This causes tragic scenes in bush residences.</p><p> </p><p> - I'll have you moved! shouts the cutter.</p><p> </p><p> - Get out of my house! replies the commander.</p><p> </p><p> I attended one of these meetings. A black chief was present.</p><p> </p><p> - Listen, my commander, he said, the 1 st of January, I paid your tax. You said to me, "Cocoa plant. I planted cocoa. You see that you are obeyed. If you say to me, "Send men to shoot the logs for the wood cutter," I will send the men to you, because I know you can hurt me. But the men have to write about it.</p><p> </p><p> - I'm not ordering you anything, said the captain, you understand: nothing.</p><p> </p><p> - So my balls are going to rot? You are a witness, sir, of how we help the settlers.</p><p> </p><p> - Maybe we could replace the men with tractors? I said.</p><p> </p><p> - Are you the one who will give me the money to buy the tractors?</p><p> </p><p> France is rich. The colonies are rich, but we do not have the mentality that the times would command us to have. Capital defies colonial affairs and the French, in its richest gold mines, still works on a small week basis! The Englishman has everything, the Belgians have everything; we did, we, the motor foutou! (the negro).</p><p> </p><p> So what do we see? We see the men's fair in Bouaké. It is quite picturesque. Clever people, aware of the difficulties of wood cutters, go up to recruit by any means in Upper Volta, in the reservoir . Knowing the price of time, they lower their goods in trucks and sell the captives at two hundred francs a head to embarrassed entrepreneurs.</p><p> </p><p> But there are no more slave traders!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The wood cutter?</p><p> </p><p> Soon the novelists will devour it. The legends surrounding the gold digger await the wood cutter. Without him, Africa would be flatter; it is its relief.</p><p> </p><p> You shouldn't see the cutter in Grand-Bassam. There, his glory has no other answer than his bank account. Stripped of its halo, it shines only with its patent pumps. These shoes, he wears even when he should have boots of seven leagues. You can hardly imagine the sensation that can be produced by the sight of two varnished pumps bustling in the bush under an overturned car. So, however, this afternoon, I met Mr. Pujol on a recruitment tour. Fortunately, it takes harsher to kill a wood cutter. Mr. Pujol was still doing very well.</p><p> </p><p> These men, ravaged by the demon of fortune, living in a mirage of millions, profile their daring figure on another field of exploits. It's here. It's the forest.</p><p> </p><p> If black suffers, so does white. The life of a site foreman is a terrible adventure.</p><p> </p><p> The forests of Côte d'Ivoire are not goals for walking, but grandiose and sneaky places where from the decomposition of the leaves rises the scent of death. Like the negro, the white lives there in the poto-poto, alone of his race and oftenfloating in its step. If he died, he would have to bury himself. On holidays, when he abandons canned food, he feasts on a monkey brain. Even strange ideas come to him. So one of them did not think he was lacking in decency by writing the most seriously in the world to the holy nun, director of the orphanage of Grand-Bassam, to ask her to choose for herself a companion, the most pretty, among its boarders!</p><p> </p><p> These young men whose strength may end up being lacking, but the stomach never, never leave chicory. You see them, in a burst of professional conscience, rise from the trunk where, exhausted, they sit and run furiously after the deserters. It doesn't catch them all. Ten thousand negroes, having fled the drawing of marbles, live indeed outside the villages, of the life of the red monkeys, between Dimbokro and Abidjan. In the evenings, one by one, the captives from the forest return from the site to the camp, the chief too. Sad return and exhausted white and defeated blacks. Not a sound, nothing but the hoarse cry of the turaco-blue, a bird speaking with a voice from beyond the grave. Then, the young man from France returns under his roof of banana leaves. He mounts his bottles of aperitif on his table,</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> ﻿Wood</p><p> cutter , What do you hear in the black forest?</p><p> - I do not hear violins</p><p> Like the happy of life,</p><p> But in my wood I hear the echo</p><p> Of the voice of my chef Bleated</p><p> Pulling his marble from Iroko!…</p><p> </p><p> The forest ! The terrifying realm of wood cutters!</p><p> </p><p> I left Abidjan in search of a site. We do not breathe completely at ease in this Ivory Coast. It looks like we are under a bell, as if the men were asking to mature!</p><p> </p><p> The forest is beautiful; it's beautiful seen from the road…</p><p> </p><p> Between Abidjan and Dabou, I will find my business. But I'm not from the country, I grope. Posts on the edge announce: "Tiama 57". Further: "Mouchibanaye 80". My card does not carry Tiama or Mouchibanaye. It was only by reading: "Mahogany 47" that I understood that these were trees and not cities. It was just the prospectors' card.</p><p> </p><p> Where is the site? No primer from Decauville. I cannot run haphazardly on the slopes; I would go astray, fall asleep, and Manian ants, which are not difficult, would eat me!</p><p> </p><p> The negroes I meet, I arrest them. I use my international language: imitating the man who cuts down a tree, the one who pulls the logs. All understand; however, they come from the depths of Côte d'Ivoire; they too are not from here.</p><p> </p><p> I get out of the car. I try a trail. Fault ! the leaves are not crushed.</p><p> </p><p> Finally, here's a black leader. We recognize a chef by his boubous, but more surely by his good health and his pounds. This one weighs in a hundred and ten; he is a great chef. He goes to Abidjan, followed by two servants. I mime my speech.</p><p> </p><p> - Wood men? does he make men to die?</p><p> </p><p> He tells me it's higher.</p><p> </p><p> Indeed.</p><p> </p><p> Here are the tracks of a Decauville. I follow them. The forest does not make you dizzy, or the one it brings is the opposite of the other: far from attracting you, it repels you. We do not move forward with a clear and consenting air. If one only listened to his instinct, we would walk back. While we traveled a hundred meters, is believed to have shot down a long way. To say he is fearless that will, in part fun, lunch in the great woods! It is true that this is happening in France. Here we don't feel good.</p><p> </p><p> It is half-light.</p><p> </p><p> Ax on the shoulder, a naked man goes down to the road. His eyes are beaten, his body broken. It is the first time that I see a tired negro. He looks at me with surprising interest.</p><p> </p><p> - The site? I said.</p><p> </p><p> He shows me that this is where he came from. A tornado is brewing. The wind begins to load the top of the trees. Everything crumples above me.</p><p> </p><p> I walk an hour. No more Decauville. The trace of fresh steps is a sufficient indication.</p><p> </p><p> Another negro appears. For him, I am a chef, and he comes to put under my nose, as a passport, a crushed and bleeding finger. I said to him, "It's good! As if I had to say something to him!</p><p> </p><p> Suddenly the forest speaks. It is first of all a somewhat extinct rumor. I advance. It seems to me that we are chanting a litany. The forest, however, is still voiceless, but the cries swell:</p><p> </p><p> - Ah ya! Ah ya! Ah ya! Ya! ya! ya! Yââââ! yââââ!</p><p> </p><p> The cries direct me. I come across the thing. A hundred naked negroes, harnessed to a marble, try to draw it.</p><p> </p><p> - Yââââ! yââââ!</p><p> </p><p> The capita beats time with its chicotte. He appears to be in convulsions. He yells :</p><p> </p><p> "Ya-ho!" Ya-ho ko-ko! "And even" Ya-ho! Ro-ko-ko! "</p><p> </p><p> In the effort, the horse-men are all in muscles. They shoot, head down. A thaw of manigolo blows falls on their stretched back. The creepers lash their faces. The blood from their feet marks their passage.</p><p> </p><p> It's a general bellow. A pack at the opening of the kennel. Pricker, jacks, whip, barking.</p><p> </p><p> A white man! He remains blissful of my presence. I'm going to him.</p><p> </p><p> "I'm interested in the life of the forest," I said. I wanted to see the woodwork.</p><p> </p><p> And I introduce myself:</p><p> </p><p> - London ...!</p><p> </p><p> - Martel, he replies.</p><p> </p><p> He was thin, exhausted; he was twenty-six years old. His eyes shone as if through the sockets of a skull. A roulette whistle hung from his belt. He was sweating everywhere.</p><p> </p><p> - Which job !</p><p> </p><p> He did :</p><p> </p><p> - It's a convict job. However, we hold! We will catch up during the leave!</p><p> </p><p> - Still far ?</p><p> </p><p> - Only eight months left! Well ! are you going to shoot</p><p> </p><p> - Ah yâ! Oh ya! Ah yâ! Yâ! Yâ!</p><p> </p><p> A negro came running:</p><p> </p><p> - Missié Matel! he shouted, missié Matel, the fallers to make sluts. Tiamé spoke and they screwed up.</p><p> </p><p> Panicked in front of the big tree that was going to fall, the fellers had left the job.</p><p> </p><p> - They will chop my tree! Ah! the s ... Idiot! ... he shouted at the capita.</p><p> </p><p> The capita explained that he had hit the deserters with all his might, but that, refusing to continue, they had insulted him by his mother.</p><p> </p><p> Fouling the humus, we hurried to the place of the drama. The tree only held in shreds.</p><p> </p><p> The capita showed a direction and said:</p><p> </p><p> - Damn it pa there!</p><p> </p><p> - We are going to "cox them"! was white.</p><p> </p><p> And here is the white man and his man who throw themselves at full speed through the forest.</p><p> </p><p> At that time, the storm broke out. It was going to take for an hour on the shoulders. White, having changed his mind, returned with two new cutters.</p><p> </p><p> - It's a thirty-ton tree. There are three logs in there, at eight hundred francs a tonne. If they flake off the base, it's a ball less, eight thousand francs lost!</p><p> </p><p> He approached the tree, proudly stroked the bark.</p><p> </p><p> - This is a tree! It is I who discovered a tiama, an African walnut. Come on! Come on! he cried to the slaughterers.</p><p> </p><p> The fallers struck.</p><p> </p><p> - Monday! howled the capita. Monday (hurry up)!</p><p> </p><p> The ax vibrated in the flesh of the wood. They beat singing in a falsetto:</p><p> </p><p> - Dibadivo! Ah ya! Nidibile!</p><p> </p><p> They were words to them; they encouraged each other. In the end, the dibadivo gave way to a long complaint, one of these complaints exhausted, sister of those you hear in hospitals. But the men were still hitting. Suddenly, a crack. One of the negroes jumped from the scaffolding. The other gave one last blow and jumped too. And the tree fell down like all the great things fall down, with a majestic noise which immediately commands silence.</p><p> </p><p> The capita returned. He had not been able to “co-opt” the deserters.</p><p> </p><p> "I will have them tomorrow or the day after," said the young white man; I know where they went.</p><p> </p><p> - Maybe they will come back from themselves to get paid?</p><p> </p><p> - They're making fun of the money. But, tonightthey can only eat in a village. I got on with his chief; he will bring them back to me with manigolo shots.</p><p> </p><p> We returned to the draw.</p><p> </p><p> - You see, I don't like to beat them, but you have to. Besides, if you take one at fault and give him a good beating, he won't hold it against you.</p><p> </p><p> He was showing me his stick.</p><p> </p><p> - I always have a stick in my hand. We don't know two ways of working here. Too bad. But I take care of them. I don't steal them on their rations. They know I'm fair if I'm tough. No one is angry with me. They are even rare those from my home who do not finish their contract. I am the least killed in the region. What do you want, it's painful to say, but the machine cannot replace the negro. You would have to be a millionaire. The banana engine, there is nothing better. Besides, only the negro can walk in the poto-poto.</p><p> </p><p> This young man was logical. He had come to Africa to make wood. He made wood with the means in force. It did not exceed the regulations.</p><p> </p><p> - Come on! Pull ! Pull !</p><p> </p><p> - Ah ya! Ah ya! Ah ya!</p><p> </p><p> - Just to bring this ball to the river, I need three days, again if the tornado does not dilute the poto too much. Finally I have nothing more to cut down for a moment; here is the rising moon, and you should not cut when the moon rises… - Kouliko! he said to his capita, you're going to choose me ten strong for swimming, huh? It's in three days.</p><p> </p><p> - Are you going to do a swimming competition?</p><p> </p><p> - In the mud, yes, and me in mind. We are going to throw the balls into the water. It is not enough to cut them, we must bring them to Abidjan, then to Grand-Bassam. Now I'm going to do the aquatic jockey, riding on my dromes. Ah! you must have health!</p><p> </p><p> - And you earn a lot of money?</p><p> </p><p> - Me ? I am not a boss, but a site manager. I earn enough not to be bored for three months in Paris once every two years.</p><p> </p><p> He sighed and said:</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! Place Clichy around seven in the evening! Little women!</p><p> </p><p> Then he returned to his state:</p><p> </p><p> - I bought shares in the gold mine, you know, next door, in Koukombo. You have to believe in a miracle. It is up to us, the colonialists, to lead by example. And then there is everything in this sacred land of Africa, you never know!… Kouliko!will say that we cut up the doe. Are you dining with me? No restaurant, you know, over here. Do you like the brains of monkeys? It's excellent… Kouliko! kills two monkeys on the way. And Odoz? Do you know Odoz, sir? He has forty million today. He arrived from Isère in savates. Ah! lady! he worked. He searched for fifteen years his millions in the poto-poto. He is the king of wood cutters. I feel as much courage as Odoz.</p><p> </p><p> - But you cough a lot.</p><p> </p><p> - I have a cough ? Do you think Odoz didn't cough? He can't even walk because he has rheumatism. The millions? Look, there they are. (With a big gesture, he showed me the frightening forest.) To me, the short sleeves, the poto-poto, the mile bills or the bilious! One of two things: either the forest enriches you or it kills you. Heads or tails. For the forest to decide!</p><p> </p><p> - Ah ya! Ah ya! Ah ya! Ya! Yâ! Yââââ! Yââââ!</p><p> </p><p> - Who are you ? I said.</p><p> </p><p> I was going down on Céchi, at kilometer 125, to another woodcutter site. Crossing Dimbokro, one of the gates of the forest of the Ivory Coast, I saw, on the village square, a white man who was planing planks, under a bomber.</p><p> </p><p> He was an old white man with a gray and shabby beard. He said, "I'm Father Seri, of course! "</p><p> </p><p> White, he had only the skin. He was Negro for the rest of his life. A gourd of couscous was waiting at his feet and three yams, his daily food. He was a wood cutter and a gold digger.</p><p> </p><p> Barefoot, in torn pants, thin and badly washed, sixty years, thirty of which in the tropics, on the nape of the neck, this adventurer looked like a ragpicker.</p><p> </p><p> He made a lounge chair ... for a negro chef.</p><p> </p><p> - Do you need something ? I said.</p><p> </p><p> - Don't worry about me. I feel good here. Native food suits me better than the other. In the past I would have digested a roasted Auvergnat with its hooves, but I have no teeth. I stay in the railway camp. Everyone knows me.</p><p> </p><p> - You don't wear a helmet?</p><p> </p><p> - No. However it seems that it is essential, I have heard it said.</p><p> </p><p> A crate filled with pebbles and bearing: "Export products Félix Potin" was near him.</p><p> </p><p> - What? Are you getting stones from Paris?</p><p> </p><p> - Hush! he said, "this is Golt's." You don't know Golt? Have you just arrived? Golt, my brother, my collaborator, the Englishman, the former lieutenant of the foreign legion. He died last month.</p><p> </p><p> And showing me the case:</p><p> </p><p> - This is his will.</p><p> </p><p> On the pebbles we saw a spoon, a knife and a half plate:</p><p> </p><p> - And this is his legacy. Golt died, but he found. Get down, look.</p><p> </p><p> - It's rocks, I say.</p><p> </p><p> - Golt found. It's gold. I alone know the place. Golt's family will one day receive a letter from Seri. It will be rich, too! He left me the address.</p><p> </p><p> From his shirt pocket, he removed a dirty piece of paper, the dead man's last writing; it read on it the name of a lady, and that of a street in Manchester.</p><p> </p><p> - Do you know, Father Seri, that the colony can repatriate you?</p><p> </p><p> - Missionaries never come back. Let me finish the lounge chair and you will see me leave. Golt, dying, said to me: "Go ahead, over there!" "</p><p> </p><p> - It is far ?</p><p> </p><p> - This is where there is gold. But that concerns me alone. And you ? So you go to Céchi, to the wood cutters? Here are some who should learn their trade… There is everything, among them: writers, former jockeys, but no cutters. They know nothing about the ball, nothing. They cut a tree seven meters high, why? It is not the top of the tree that is beautiful. It is the foot. The wood is in the foot. They are wasting the forest. A black man comes and says to them: "I found fifty mahogany trees. They ransack everything else to get the fifty mahogany trees. It quickly goes to fall a secular forest! It's amassacre. We can no longer go where they went. The plague is the mahogany hunters. They escape nature and the negro. Ax and manigolo!</p><p> </p><p> Thereupon the strange man returned to his chaise longue.</p><p> </p><p> - Let's go ! good luck ! Father Seri.</p><p> </p><p> And I went to take the train.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> - Do you stop at kilometer 125? said the only European in the convoy. Then you will have to signal the mechanic to slow down. Otherwise, we descend to Céchi, and there are still four kilometers on foot.</p><p> </p><p> He was a small, healthy man, the whites of his eyes rather red. He said he was a mahogany hunter.</p><p> </p><p> - I'm being spied on, you know. They say: "Muss the prospector went to the forest. We will follow him. I am forced to trick. Take it from the seed. You should never say where you're going. And you, right away, you said to me: "I'm going to kilometer 125." Bad! Bad ! It is the open struggle in this country. The margouillat eats the mosquito, the snake eats the margouillat. The mongoose eats the snake, the white eats the black. Buyer Beware! Did you do a bad thing in your youth? Are you in "Consumption"? I am Muss. I have not always behaved well in France. There is a bench seat in my coat of arms. The forest rehabilitates me.</p><p> </p><p> - So, are you a prospector?</p><p> </p><p> - Now. Before I was site manager. I was appreciated. What ace I did! Black people were afraid of me. They called me the Panther. They say I'm brutal. No ! But I have something in my eyes, I glare at them. They said: "Missié Muss knows" good manner ". I'm starting to empty myself, however. This is because the climate is wearing out here! But speak! if I saw myself forced to be repatriated as destitute, I would be shot in the head. Never saw wood, you hear, it melts. Squaring on the spot and have it pulled in time. There, no more prejudices, shoot with what you have on hand, men, children, women, even if they have a kid in the belly or in the back. Never mind ! if the breasts fall and scrape the earth. First of all, save the ball! One day, I went to a village, I took the women, I tied them to my car. I was starting to start. Then the men, who had been hiding, ran to get their wives. So I "mated" the males. Another piece of advice: instead of hitting it too hard, water itthe nose with gin and it will pull. Here, this is where you have to jump. We are at 125. Here is the site box. Good luck !</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> And I jumped from the train, into the trench of the track, between the two walls of the forest. My friend Bernard was waiting for me.</p><p> </p><p> He was a woodcutter of another race. As an adventurer, he preferred that of a builder. Bordeaux, body and tongue still in action, he carried his twenty-five years of Ivory Coast with outstretched arms. He was one of those who said: "Africa kills? look at Bernard! "</p><p> </p><p> I arrived a day late. I had lost this time before Dimbokro, while I was driving in a car. We never stopped crossing the rivers, the smugglers being always on the other side, as the concierge is on the stairs! It was half past six in the evening. I climbed the backfill.</p><p> </p><p> - Five hundred thousand wood lice in my Iroko logs! cried Bernard, "but I thought you were devoured by the Manian ants!"</p><p> </p><p> - Hello, god of the forest! I said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> One by one, black, exhausted, returned from the site. They did not win their camp, but, whatthat evening they stopped in front of the chief's hut. It was the end of the month, pay day.</p><p> </p><p> "You fall just to attend the session," said Bernard. Sit next to me, behind this table. Poincaré! bring the storm lamp!</p><p> </p><p> - Do you also have a Poincaré at home?</p><p> </p><p> - It's the fashion !</p><p> </p><p> - Is your head still good, Poincaré?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, missié Bénad, my head is still good.</p><p> </p><p> - You did not scum this month?</p><p> </p><p> - I finished making capsize, missié Bénad.</p><p> </p><p> - That's Tour-Eiffel. Still old, my poor Eiffel Tower?</p><p> </p><p> - Always old! missié boss.</p><p> </p><p> Bernard examined his two hundred men.</p><p> </p><p> - You hear ? he said to his capita, no brutality. Recruitment is already quite difficult. I have a good reputation, I don't want to lose it in a fortnight. Do not "paint" my name. Why does this one no longer stand up?</p><p> </p><p> - He was marabouté (poisoned).</p><p> </p><p> - So there are witch doctors over there? Who marabouted you, Samba?</p><p> </p><p> - Me, write!</p><p> </p><p> - Did you see a witch doctor?</p><p> </p><p> Samba said nothing. It spread over the earth. They took him to the camp.</p><p> </p><p> Capita Poincaré approached the patron:</p><p> </p><p> - Missie, he cried, me old servant, me good capita, increase me.</p><p> </p><p> - My heart will bleed, Poincaré, if you ask me for a raise; my heart is not happy to pay so much money.</p><p> </p><p> - But you ? happy with Poincaré?</p><p> </p><p> - You are too strong for me, you will have fifty francs more.</p><p> </p><p> We sat behind the table. The night had come. Two hurricane lamps lit up.</p><p> </p><p> "I must warn you, Mr. Bernard," said the foreman, "that the administrator's clerk came ten days ago to get the men's taxes paid."</p><p> </p><p> - What? said Bernard. He does not have the right ! And did you pay?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes.</p><p> </p><p> - You were wrong. These men have already had to pay their tax to the chief of the canton. So they will have paid twice. What will they touch now? Finally, it's done. Poincaré, explain to them that the commander has come to collect their tax and that we will deduct this amount over their month.</p><p> </p><p> Poincaré palabra.</p><p> </p><p> - What do they say ?</p><p> </p><p> - They say it's good.</p><p> </p><p> - Come on! let's start!</p><p> </p><p> The site foreman, list in hand, called:</p><p> </p><p> - Zié!</p><p> </p><p> - Take!</p><p> </p><p> Zié earned 77 francs in his month. The boss paid 88 francs tax: 40 for the capitation, 48 for the purchase of benefits. After a month of work (in the forest), Zié owes 11 fr. !</p><p> </p><p> - You understand ? we ask him.</p><p> </p><p> Bernard decides to keep her only 50 francs this month. We line up 38 francs. Zié says: “Thank you! "</p><p> </p><p> - Come on! Bernard, if they are sent to work in the forest, they cannot go to benefits. Why are they asked for 48 francs because they are forced to do one job rather than another?</p><p> </p><p> - That, says Bernard, is "way for negro". White people don't have to understand.</p><p> </p><p> A great chatter rose from the crowd.</p><p> </p><p> - Makou! cried Bernard.</p><p> </p><p> Silence is established.</p><p> </p><p> All were present at the call of their names. They had resigned themselves to taking what was given to them. They never asked for an explanation. They say to him: "30 francs! He reached out, received, and went away.</p><p> </p><p> Mediki had worked all month; he only received 12 francs. All the same, the thing seemed exaggerated to him. He says, "Thank you! Thank you ! But ironically.</p><p> </p><p> - Ticoubé? Where is Ticoubé?</p><p> </p><p> "Left in the bush," said Poincaré. Escape! He had 32 francs on his account.</p><p> </p><p> - Georgea?</p><p> </p><p> - Left in the bush. Escape! 52 francs to his account.</p><p> </p><p> - Augustine?</p><p> </p><p> "Quite sick," said the capita. For a month he hasn't eaten.</p><p> </p><p> - So who eats his rations?</p><p> </p><p> "No rations," replied Poincaré; him not to work, him not to eat.</p><p> </p><p> - You are disgusting! Let me bring Augustin.</p><p> </p><p> Augustine appeared between two blacks, as between two crutches.</p><p> </p><p> - What do you have, Augustin?</p><p> </p><p> - Me write.</p><p> </p><p> - Give him 52 francs from Georgea. And make it eat, wild!</p><p> </p><p> - Knitted? Here ! you have no tax, you, how is it done?</p><p> </p><p> - Me ? responds Knitted, me desalinated, very clever, I changed my name in the village.</p><p> </p><p> He received 76 francs.</p><p> </p><p> - Jeannot? Jeannot?…</p><p> </p><p> - No one showed up.</p><p> </p><p> "He is dead," said the site foreman.</p><p> </p><p> Maoudi and Robert II were also dead. Goupi had only 22 francs on his account.</p><p> </p><p> - You have no tax and you only have 22 francs?</p><p> </p><p> - Lazy like a chicken! said Poincaré.</p><p> </p><p> Fifteen Betés paraded.</p><p> </p><p> - If the sick die, have them buried right away, the Betés would eat them. You hear ? said Bernard, addressing the cannibals, if you eat dead friends, me chicotte.</p><p> </p><p> Baoulé had 128 francs tax: 40 for him, 40 for his wife, 48 for buyout. His gain was only 73 francs.</p><p> </p><p> - Give me 10 francs, missié Bénad, said Baoulé sadly.</p><p> </p><p> We gave him 30.</p><p> </p><p> A month of suffering in the forest and a debt for wages? The organization of work perhaps leaves something to be desired in Africa?</p><p> </p><p> His name was Birama. I had taken him to Bamako prison. Not out of a humanitarian spirit. No manifestation on my part. But in Africa the prison is the employment office. There, the administrators and the favored whites go to look for their servant. There were ten prisoners in the courtyard of the club. By pointing to one, I say, "I'm taking this one. He doesn't look very strong; if he attacks me, I can defend myself. I fell badly: he was a witch doctor who had sacrificed a small child for worship. I had the right to choose among the others. One had a round face; he was very curly. No more Negro than him. His face seemed to sum up all the black races so well that in the end I called him the Negro-Reunited. It was Birama. I took her.</p><p> </p><p> First I bought him the jacket that you know, but he exchanged it for a tin ocarina. Every time I came home, I found itsitting at my door, harmoniously sucking his instrument.</p><p> </p><p> - When will you decide to wash my clothes? I said to him.</p><p> </p><p> He answered me with a new tune he had just composed. At Segou, he asked me for a hundred francs in advance. I gave it to him. He returned ten minutes later, his hair wet and emitting a considerable odor at twenty meters. In his hand, he was holding an empty bottle, a bottle of good perfume, An afternoon will come! perhaps ! He had entered the trader's; pointing to the bottle, he said:</p><p> </p><p> - How ?</p><p> </p><p> - One hundred francs ?</p><p> </p><p> The hundred francs paid, he had uncorked the object of his desires and all of a sudden, in the shop, he had emptied the contents on his mop. At Niafounké, he made me a pretty one. He continued not to wash my clothes, for lack of soap, he said. Every morning I gave him five francs to buy this famous soap. I saw neither the five francs nor Birama for the day. When I blamed him, he played his music to me, and everything ended in harmony. So I brought her a nice green bar of soap and said, "This time, huh! no joke. "The next day, notof linen! "Where's the soap?" I asked him. He showed me an old, dilapidated dilapidated helmet he wore proudly on hair that had once been so fragrant. He had traded the soap for this junk. Do you know why ? We must seek to understand the actions of men. This is how Birama reasoned. Anyway, he said to himself, this soap is lost for the doctor. It will melt in the water. However, for the past two weeks, I have had a mad desire to own a helmet. I give the soap and I have the helmet. The toubab loses nothing and I gain from it. But the laundry? are you going to think. Was he wearing linen?</p><p> </p><p> At first, he grieved me. "I haven't eaten!" " he said. He was obviously eating. He had something and it showed. But do you ever know? I lined up a loaf of bread and a five franc note for him. An entire week I left him at home. I did not need his eminent services to run the Lobi. I returned from the Lobi. In front of my door stood a negro, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses, helmeted and shod; a magnificent boubou on the body, a cane in one hand and a strap flute. He said to me "Bonjou! I recognized the voice: it was Birama. He looked like a music hall chimpanzee. I started to laugh when he said:</p><p> </p><p> - Me, not eaten!</p><p> </p><p> - What? haven't you eaten in seven days?</p><p> </p><p> - Yes !</p><p> </p><p> It was fat and fresh. It was even pink!</p><p> </p><p> - And the sixty francs that I left you when I left?</p><p> </p><p> He showed me his purchases and counted in front of me: stick (cane), 9 francs; music, 17 francs; boots (they were sneakers), 11 francs; boubou, 20 francs.</p><p> </p><p> - And the other three francs?</p><p> </p><p> He stretched out his hand: a superb copper ring answered for him.</p><p> </p><p> He had eaten, it was of course. Until the evening, he kept repeating: "I haven't eaten!" At the end, I gave him 20 francs. He disappeared. An hour later I saw him return; he had increased his equipment with an umbrella, under the dome of which, majestically, he was advancing!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> We couldn't have found a more Negro than Birama. There is one who did not deny his land and his dead!</p><p> </p><p> - Come, Birama! I said to him one day at Diré, we're going to buy canned food.</p><p> </p><p> We bought them. This made two cases. I took one and said, "Take the other." I left in front. Near the house, I turned around. Birama was a hundred yards away, umbrella in hand. What had he done with my box? It was another - a naked negro - who wore it. Birama was shouting, "Come on! come on! He had "pinned" him on the way and ordered from the top of his helmet and glasses. The naked had obeyed as always.</p><p> </p><p> - And now, I said to him when they both arrived, who will pay "him"?</p><p> </p><p> He replied naturally:</p><p> </p><p> - Him ? never paid!</p><p> </p><p> He knew it. We had to hit him more than once. He taught me to live in Africa.</p><p> </p><p> It was at Oumé, in Ivory Coast, that he gave me Another lesson. Just that day, the French authorities were going to kill three fetishists who had impaled a woman from the village of Zangué on the pretext that she was inhabited by the devil and that this was causing harm to her family. It was one of those ritual crimes that we prosecute without much success. Wizards are still powerful. We know very well that in Kalavi three young virgins are raised up to sixteen years old and then sacrificed to the god of the lagoon so that the year is good in fish; that the chief of the Niaboua tribe was able to eat thirteen young girls without attracting our attention; that the fourteenth alone lost him; that he confessed to the commander that the girl was the best, and that he even gave herthe recipe: boil, not roast. We also know that an administrator formerly found two blacks on the village square, that they were waiting to be eaten, that the administrator delivered them, but that once the white left, the two blacks returned from themselves in the cage so as not to disobey the gods. We are aware that when the Betés catch a Peuhl or two, it is always a good feast in perspective. But it is difficult for us to prevent these sacrifices. We can only punish them. This is what we were going to do at Oumé.</p><p> </p><p> - Look, I said to Birama, showing him the three wizards, they are your fetishists. They killed a poor woman. White now will kill them. Birama said nothing. He was thinking. The riflemen armed their weapons. First discharge. One fell.</p><p> </p><p> Birama asked me if the woman they had killed was old. I tell her that she was old.</p><p> </p><p> Second discharge. Another fell.</p><p> </p><p> "If she was old, it was because she was going to die soon," Birama explained to me.</p><p> </p><p> Third discharge. The last one fell.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> This morning Birama entered my room.</p><p> </p><p> - Have you eaten, Birama?</p><p> </p><p> - No ! not eaten!</p><p> </p><p> This question and this answer had become my delight. I saw Birama, head at the bottom of his calabash, stuffed with rice or millet. Five minutes later, I asked him:</p><p> </p><p> - You ate ?</p><p> </p><p> - No ! not eaten!</p><p> </p><p> The stomach of a negro is surely bottomless. In short, he brought me a catalog.</p><p> </p><p> He brought it to me not for me, but for him.</p><p> </p><p> - What do you want me to do with this?</p><p> </p><p> The catalogs of our department stores flood Africa, not only the coast, but the interior. They arrive by bags. The bags are addressed to MM. the interpreters, the chief of the guards, the chief of the canton, MM. school students. And it is said that French trade is not clever! These deliveries are the most triumphant success. The negro who stays two months without receiving his catalog believes he has been wronged and has the department stores write a reminder letter! For whole days this pretty book is under the eyes of the native who does not find anything more attractive. It dazzles! And he commands with flying colors. Some reading the word towel and not seeing any further, bring in fifty francs for this merchandise. They receive rolls of paperend, then they imagine that they were stolen; the others stick to children's clothes, because it costs less, and they are surprised that they cannot put them on. In Ouagadougou, three trucks of postal parcels arrive each week. My boy wanted a feather duster! With his finger, he showed me the object.</p><p> </p><p> - You are crazy ? Go away !</p><p> </p><p> In the afternoon, he put his catalog under my nose, and his finger on his feather duster.</p><p> </p><p> "Write for me," he said, "to Madame Samaritaine!"</p><p> </p><p> - Do you want to tell me what you want to do with a feather duster?</p><p> </p><p> - To make music.</p><p> </p><p> This time I thought he was making fun of me. He did not laugh, however. He mimed the use for which he intended it: he had taken the feather duster for a grand clarinet!</p><p> </p><p> Ah! Birama, my old boy, you never wash my clothes, you are always hungry, you put on my pajamas, but, five thousand kilometers from your country, you are always without knowing where you are going and you order a feather duster to play clarinet!</p><p> </p><p> It was at Dahomey, in Porto-Novo.</p><p> </p><p> Before us, two kingdoms shared Dahomey. One had its king on the Abomey plateau and the other on the lagoon, in Porto-Novo. Even, it was the king of the lagoon who called us to help against Behanzin, his "cousin" of the plateau.</p><p> </p><p> Since then, coconuts have been renewed in palm groves. Behanzin is buried and the successor of the sovereign of the lagoon is no longer appointed as superior chief. One king, however, resisted the European tidal wave: it is the Zounan, in other words the King of the Night.</p><p> </p><p> What are its functions? Its title alone tells us that they must be quite obscure. At the time of the kingdom of Porto-Novo, the Zounan was responsible for enforcing the correct order from sunset to sunrise. Governing in broad daylight, France does not seem to have dispossessed the representative of the night. Either way, he still reigns.</p><p> </p><p> He had to get to know him.</p><p> </p><p> - When do you want to summon him? asked me Mr. Fourn, not only governor of Dahomey, but a little Dahomean, since for thirty years he had commanded in the country.</p><p> </p><p> - This afternoon at three o'clock.</p><p> </p><p> - Are you thinking about it? The Night King does not go out in the afternoon. All he can do is get between dog and wolf.</p><p> </p><p> We choose six twenty-five.</p><p> </p><p> That evening we were waiting for His Majesty in the government garden.</p><p> </p><p> A little after a quarter past six, we heard the sound of voices: a procession was going up the main avenue of the capital. Governor Fourn pulled on his mustache and looked at me out of the corner of my eye. The procession became more precise. Seven naked negroes, large and small, were harnessed to stretchers, making horses. It was a cab that was advancing. On the seat, replacing the coachman, two little black girls, firm and bare breasts and holding between their breasts one a vase of silver, the other an incense burner. At the place where the collignon put their whip, a French flag. On the left, the lantern with blue painted glasses was lit. A few umbrellas sheltered the roof of the harp. All around and pushing behind, a large clientele stirred.</p><p> </p><p> The crazy car squeaked the gravel from the garden and stopped.</p><p> </p><p> The blinds on both doors were drawn. It looked like the cab of adultery. We waited. Nothing was moving in the trunk.</p><p> </p><p> "It is not yet dark enough," said the governor.</p><p> </p><p> One of the customers slipped under the vehicle and knocked on the floor. I thought he meant to tell the king that His Majesty had arrived. Silence.</p><p> </p><p> - He must comb himself; he is very pretty.</p><p> </p><p> Then an imperative cough shook the "tree". People rushed. The umbrellas came running. A youth who carried the royal saber horizontally on his belly pulled over. The door opened: Zounon Mêdjé dit le Zounan, king of the Night, appeared. Youth with saber and youth with incense burner surrounded him; one was his daughter, the other his favorite wife. Thus flanked, slowly, the old man stepped between two attractive breasts. Wearing a high feathered shack, wearing a heavy green velvet dress embroidered with silver, his shoulder draped in a yellow toga, while looking at his silver sandals, he was blowing violently from the nose in his short white beard with two points.</p><p> </p><p> - Good evening! Zounan, said the governor.</p><p> </p><p> We had to be careful not to say hello!</p><p> </p><p> And we entered a private room.</p><p> </p><p> The first contact was going to be, so to speak, only visual. It was the formal visit.</p><p> </p><p> - How is the country? asked the governor.</p><p> </p><p> - He's fine, very good.</p><p> </p><p> - And your health, Zounan?</p><p> </p><p> - I wish each evening that it is worth yours.</p><p> </p><p> We exchanged a few other similar comments. Then a boy passed the champagne glasses. The king took out a large handkerchief, veiled his face and, behind this screen, he drank. When he drinks or eats, no one should contemplate the royal face. His throat was less discreet, so you could hear him if you couldn't see him.</p><p> </p><p> He tells us that he would be very honored to receive us at his home.</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! that's understood, Zounan, said the governor. We will see you tomorrow morning at ten.</p><p> </p><p> A proud joy lit his face. They led him back to his cab, and, jolting, whining, the old rolling thing went away, with torches.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I went down to Porto-Novo. No otherAfrican city cannot be compared to that one. It is neither a heap of huts nor a European city. Of all the blacks, the Dahomeans are the most civilized. The first, many centuries ago, were in contact with white people. Their coast, which is called the Slave Coast, says by its very name that it was the place where the traders had first set up their market. The ancestors' trip to the Americas opened the minds of the sons. From primitive life they gradually rose to the life of society. They discovered the taste for commerce. Trade creating bonds, they built cities. Porto-Novo was drawn and built by them. The Dahomeans are the only natives of French Africa who have put themselves in their furniture.</p><p> </p><p> The night market was in full swing. The taste for trading is pushed so far here that buying and selling does not stop at sunset. The traffickers operate in the open air until eleven in the evening. Hundreds of night lights, kerosene lamps or candles glow close to the ground. From afar you would think a field of big flies on fire. It looks nice. I watched this spectacle when a push of the people occurred. By the umbrellas and the torches I recognized the procession of the King of the Night. His Majesty was going home. I pulled over. Precisely the Zounan got out of the cab. We were twenty paces away, but the sovereign had seen me. So, instead of entering his house, he faced me. And in the large empty space that popular deference had left before him, having greeted me with his chest, he picked up his dress and began to dance. First three small steps with the right foot, then three with the left foot. Then he extended his arm and his toga flapped at his side like a large wing. Again he bowed and the old man spun around. The feather of his bicorn swept the space; his beard, certainly, must have trembled. I remained motionless. He danced for more than three minutes. Then he took off his hat and, with a broad gesture, under the eyes of the crowd and by torchlight, he greeted me like a sword. Then, leaving me frozen in place, he disappeared into his house.</p><p> </p><p> "It is a great honor he has done you," Mr. Fourn later told me. "Look," he said to you in his own way, "the king dances for you, noble traveler; he is only your histrion. "</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The next morning we were on time. The Zounan was waiting for us, not outside, but in his courtyard. It is allowed to see the light of day between its walls. He had sported a plaid dress. Medals coated his chest. His leader was covered in a real jockey cap. The set gave: red hat, orange gown.</p><p> </p><p> Women, servants, customers, Chienlit swarmed around us.</p><p> </p><p> He preceded us, hitting the cane like a halberd. We climb a wooden staircase. The room that received us sweat velvet and satin. A round table already focused on the dishes we were going to eat and the bottles promised to our thirst. There was champagne, mint alcohol and kikrini, an English medicine for fever, colic, goosebumps and itchy scalp!</p><p> </p><p> The king sniffed with ease. Governor, administrator, chief of police, all the white authority seated in its armchairs!</p><p> </p><p> A statue of Our Lady of Lourdes, under a glass bell, sat in the best place. As I looked at her, the king said:</p><p> </p><p> - Marie! It's Marie !</p><p> </p><p> - Your Majesty is Catholic? I said.</p><p> </p><p> - I was before I was king. Since then, my people being a fetishist, I had to make them politely to believe in their fetishes. But I still love Marie. Ah! Marie!</p><p> </p><p> The Zounan was glaring at the chief of police. There was something! The king's last wife had once fled the palace. affected considerably, Zounan had entrusted his sentence to our detective. The detective had not been very eager to find this youth. I even believe that he had advised His Majesty to let the fifteen-year-old child follow the path of his heart.</p><p> </p><p> - So, are you still mad at me? said the white man.</p><p> </p><p> The king replied simply:</p><p> </p><p> - A young girl is the alcohol of the old man.</p><p> </p><p> - Zounan! said the governor, you know how great we are. We can speak with confidence. Well ! your people are not very encouraging. No matter how much you do for him, he never says thank you.</p><p> </p><p> - That is true ! we never say thank you, but when you do something good, we pray for you the fetishes in the houses.</p><p> </p><p> Thereupon, under the pretext of drinking, he hid his mocking eyes behind his handkerchief.</p><p> </p><p> Having revealed himself, he continued:</p><p> </p><p> - I'll tell you: the people here are like women who have two pockets, one in front, the other behind. In the front pocket, which is pierced, they put recognition for the good that has been done to them; in the back pocket, which is made of rhino skin, they bring the memorymistreatment and resentment, and it never goes away.</p><p> </p><p> A phonograph air rose. One of Zounan's women, having entered on all fours in the living room, had reassembled the machine. Zounan drove the wife away with a handkerchief, as well as all the customers who, blocking doors and windows, prevented the zephir from caressing us.</p><p> </p><p> "Listen, governor," he went on, "it is only when a woman goes to another husband that she recognizes that her first was good." So my people will do for you. Even the king's wives are not happy with him. Listen carefully, my governor, my z'ami, a great chief must have neither z'amis nor brothers. A great chef should not count on the recognition of the crowd because he cannot have two mouths, one that will say white to one to make him happy and the other black to the second to make him happy too. Look, governor, a great chef doesn't have to take market stories into account.</p><p> </p><p> He veiled his face again, and behind his silk handkerchief we heard:</p><p> </p><p> - Recognition is a big deal only for little people.</p><p> </p><p> The painter Rouquayrol drew it secretly. The Zounan slipped towards him a friendly and accomplice eye which signified: "Are you okay, painting?" "</p><p> </p><p> We had to taste the pies. The king himself cut the shares. The plate on which he presented the piece to me was decorated with a portrait of Edward VII.</p><p> </p><p> - My good colleague! he said, not without emphasizing with a smile the audacity of such a rapprochement.</p><p> </p><p> He chased away women, children and servants again.</p><p> </p><p> - Being King of the Night, I am forbidden to sleep. I cannot therefore afford to travel. I only know Porto-Novo. Tell me, honorable traveler, tell me a little bit about the world.</p><p> </p><p> "Dear Majesty," I said, "it is nothing other than Porto-Novo, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller.</p><p> </p><p> "I suspected as much," he said.</p><p> </p><p> He offered us kikrini, asti, mint alcohol and a purgative drink.</p><p> </p><p> "If I had known," he added, "I would have cooked a turkey for you."</p><p> </p><p> By this he meant that the pleasure he felt from our visit went beyond what he had expected.</p><p> </p><p> We took leave. While accompanying us, he said:</p><p> </p><p> - Where there is money there is peace.</p><p> </p><p> When greeting Governor Fourn, he proclaimed:</p><p> </p><p> - In my country, as long as you are a great chef, you are not congratulated.</p><p> </p><p> Then he took off his jockey cap.</p><p> </p><p> He did not have the skull uncovered for this.</p><p> </p><p> Even during the day, the king was in a nightcap!</p><p> </p><p> Abomey was in mourning. Twenty years after his death, Behanzin, dressed in a European coffin, returned to his capital. France, having felt its ashes, had deemed them cold enough not to set the country on fire. It was also, like that, hot enough at Dahomey!</p><p> </p><p> It was a great mourning, that is to say, a beautiful celebration.</p><p> </p><p> Ouanilo, the darling son of the dead, had brought his father back, on behalf of our government, from Algeria to Marseille, from Marseille to Cotonou, and from the Slave Coast to Abomey. Left with him at the time of exile, when he was a little black prince. Ouanilo, raised by France at first in Martinique, then in Algiers was now a lawyer before the court of Bordeaux.</p><p> </p><p> It touched native soil for the first time since its uprooting. He returned there with his black father and his white wife.</p><p> </p><p> Elegant, European dressed, educated, full of reserve and tact, he was truly a shy gentleman. So many good manners immediately banished him from his homeland. In the midst of his shirtless brothers, he no longer knew what to do with his collar, his clothes, his shoes and especially his education. He looked at his parents with a forgiving eye.</p><p> </p><p> The funeral would last a long time. Governor Fourn had housed the prince and princess in a white house, not far from the ruins of the palace where, in the shadow of the father's throne, screwed on four skulls, the royal child was born.</p><p> </p><p> The shutters of this house remained closed.</p><p> </p><p> Behanzin, according to custom, was not yet considered dead. The coffin in which his remains rested was in the auntie of his eldest son, the great Aouagbé, prefect of Boïcon and Abomey, but, for the people, Behanzin was only very ill. The natives approaching, wondering with anguish about the health of the king. "We have to go home," they said, "our king is no better." They spoke low and walked away in silence. My boy came running up and said to me: "I know, the king is even more sick than this morning. Two of his wives, so old that when they walked their dodeline heads up to their knees, they were watching in the dark near the coffin,back from such a long journey. Finally, the next day, Behanzin officially died.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The Dahomean festivals began. The drum is established.</p><p> </p><p> The first day, eldest son, son and daughters, brothers and sisters and sincere friends lamented in the auntie.</p><p> </p><p> On the second day, the gri-gri So went out.</p><p> </p><p> On the third day, Behanzin's superior friend, the one who said to him, "Don't fight the French," killed three kids.</p><p> </p><p> On the fourth day, the sons slaughtered domestic animals.</p><p> </p><p> Ouanilo, still dressed in European clothes, was doing his duty. I saw him return, auntie to his house, blood on his hands and on his shirt. He walked fast, ashamed. Behind the shutters, his anxiously white wife was waiting for him.</p><p> </p><p> The funeral continued. While the Ouanilo brothers, rich and powerful chefs, were preparing to offer sumptuous gifts to their father's manes, Ouanilo counted his money. The day of the presentation of the loincloths, his shame would break out in front of the united country. The funeral attendant would shout the names of his brothers for hours, spreading their generosity, their filial piety. Ouanilo had neither herds nor family treasures. His people no longer gave him gifts. His people ? He looked at the former little prince without wanting to remember. Ouanilo was no longer at home. He went to Boïcon, to the white merchants. White merchants don't give a lot of goods for little money. Ouanilo returned with a few pieces of calico. He had a ring, he would attach it to his poor loincloths to prove his good will.</p><p> </p><p> The big day arrived.</p><p> </p><p> It was in the courtyard of the great aunt of Aouagbé, his older brother. The white authorities, from the governor to the bishop, were there. The seventy women of Aouagbé, grouped together, sang the funeral song. Ouanilo, hesitant, moved away from the wild cries and led his white wife, immensely disturbed by the fury of his sisters-in-law, between the bishop and the governor. Each of his brothers stood, according to custom, in the midst of his wives and servants. Ouanilo looked for where to stand.</p><p> </p><p> A movement of surprise raised this crowd. Magnificent, draped in red, a powerful naked breast outside, wearing a Phrygian cap, wearing sandals, a scepter-puzzle on a shoulder, a man with the appearance of God appeared under an umbrella, between two dazzling amazons and followed by the royal apparatus. It was Agboli-Agbo, the uncle ofOuanilo, the brother of Behanzin, the last king of Dahomey dethroned, exiled and then forgiven.</p><p> </p><p> Agboli-Agbo attempted for the second time a bold move. He presented himself to the people in royal posture. The administrator, as during a last July 14, was he going to rush on him, with one hand grabbing him by the breast, fingernails in the flesh, and with the other snatching his cap, his sandals, his scepter and his spittoon?</p><p> </p><p> The old lion seemed to be waiting for the scene. It did not take place. He settled in the middle of his yard, his amazons. Ouanilo looked at him as astonished.</p><p> </p><p> The barker started. Brother and son had long honors. Loincloths, fans, bottles of liquor, gold and silver objects, oxen, animal skins, they all offered to be buried in the big hole where Behanzin was going to descend. When Ouanilo's name fell on the crowd, carried by so few gifts, it made such a small noise that no one looked for the darling son. Ouanilo bowed his head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> In the shuttered house, Ouanilo and his white wife did not taste the dishes sent to him by his father's former subjects. The couscous, the rice, the eggs themselves were thrown away at night. His embarrassment was great before a gourd of water, when I asked him for a drink. He made me understand that he wanted not to give me this liquid, which he himself would not drink.</p><p> </p><p> Kingdom of fetishists, that is to say of poison, Dahomey is in the hand of sorcerers. It is both the most advanced and the most secret black country. Archbishop Steinmetz, our bishop, knows this well, he who had to intervene this week with the priests of the devil, without which his missionary, hit the other day by three veiled fetishists, while he was returning by bicycle on the road to Kalavi , would have died already. His arm had stiffened, then dried up, the disease spread to the shoulder, the chest. Monsignor sent for the witch chief, who said to him: "O great white man! the respect that you inspire in me forces me to say that my ghosts have done this. - O great witch doctor, replied the prelate, in love with me, you will heal my servant. The counter poison was given. The missionary today shook my hand with a valid hand.</p><p> </p><p> Fetishers and fetishists in frilly tutu swarmed at the funeral of Behanzin. Ouanilo made a big detour to avoid them.</p><p> </p><p> At night, the loyal boy of the French commander entered the home of the lawyer from Bordeaux: he brought boxes of canned goods on which the priests of Maon could not let their eyes drop.</p><p> </p><p> Ouanilo went alone to discover his cradle. I saw him walking on the Abomey plateau, stopping, wondering. One day a chief passed by him in his hammock; his housekeepers carried the parasol, the spittoon and the other attributes. While the Ouanilo brothers, larger chiefs than the passer-by, had cleared the road, Ouanilo pulled over to the edge and with an eye in which the astonishment of a white man read, he followed the traditional procession for a long time.</p><p> </p><p> One day he sat in the midst of the ruins of his father's palace. In one of his hands, resting on his knee, he held his other hand. On these mud walls, defeated by time, he cast a foreign look. He got up and scanned the site. He bowed to the tomb of Glé-Glé, his grandfather, when he should have fallen to the ground and struck his forehead against the ground. His ancestors no longer called him.</p><p> </p><p> The seventy and seventy wives of his brothers plunged him into great reflections. I saw him discreetly throw his cigarette, while they were smoking a pipe. In his living room, one evening that we were chatting, his brother Robert entered, shirtless. He made him sit in an armchair, facing the white princess, his wife, in dinner dress. He looked like a quartered. Every evening, the unfortunate man had a headache. He no longer supported the tom-tom.He was a poor uprooted man. He himself admitted: “Ah! these funerals; they never end! "</p><p> </p><p> Two months passed. I was off Cotonou, on the American liner . The sea was surging. We were wondering if we were going to be able to board passengers. Barges were trying to approach the edge; the flow thwarted the maneuver. In these barges, curious coaches, coaches of which only the body has been kept, the wheels having left we don't know where, contained the travelers. These were the coaches without which we could neither disembark nor embark on this coast. A crane deposits and lifts them. They are swaying for a while above the sea. It looks like a plane leaving for the crossing of the South Atlantic!</p><p> </p><p> - Here ! I say, it's Ouanilo and the princess who hang at the end of the crane. We haven't poisoned them!</p><p> </p><p> Prince Ouanilo was returning to his country, to France.</p><p> </p><p> The coach having overturned on arrival, it was on their knees that the Behanzins entered on board. Robert and another brother accompanied the travelers.</p><p> </p><p> The heavy swell had tested them. They went up to the bar to take a cordial.</p><p> </p><p> - Get out! said the bartender, no negroes here.</p><p> </p><p> - But, said Ouanilo, I'm a first class passenger.</p><p> </p><p> - Again, you, I can serve you, you are clean; but not the two macaques!</p><p> </p><p> Ouanilo came to get me. He told me that his brothers were sick, which you could see; that the bartender refused them a glass of cognac; that, nevertheless, they had made war in France; that Robert had been injured.</p><p> </p><p> Suspect as white in Dahomey, suspect as black in France, poor Ouanilo! I had the cognac brought to his cabin.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The American sailing for several days. Ouanilo ate alone with the princess on a small table of two, living quietly, smiling, hoping that soon the whites would forgive him for being black. He told me how happy he was to come back to Bordeaux. The last month seemed so long to him in Abomey! He felt lost, especially we looked at him badly!</p><p> </p><p> One evening Ouanilo did not appear in the dining room. The sea, however, was calm. A boy came to tell the doctor who left the table. The dinner of the other passengers ended. An hour later, the captain informed me that Ouanilo was at the end. The doctor confirmed thesentence. In his cabin, Ouanilo was lying motionless but, Ouanilo was no longer Ouanilo. In three hours his figure had married I don't know what other resemblance. He was going to die.</p><p> </p><p> - Wizards! wizards! he said.</p><p> </p><p> It lasted until ten o'clock the next morning. We had time to land it in Dakar. He died there immediately. He had brought his father back to Africa. His fate meant that he would die there too.</p><p> </p><p> The boat that was taking me to Ecuador was called Europe , a very small old thing very old, having rocked, at the very least, three generations of colonials.</p><p> </p><p> I was on deck because you can't always be at the bar, especially when you have a lot more heartburn than heartache!</p><p> </p><p> A man with a triangular figure approached me, touched his helmet and said: I am a friend of Philippe Lallemand. He indicated to me that I would meet you on this path. Hi !</p><p> </p><p> He said he was coming directly from Monte-Carlo. Otherwise, he added, he would still be in possession of fourteen thousand francs, enough to live four months in the metropolis. But bah! He went back into the administration, and went to hunt elephants. His name was Rass. Suddenly he disappeared.</p><p> </p><p> He seemed as well made to hunt the elephant as I was to play the flageolet. Also, meeting the man a moment later: You have beautiful rifles, I asked him? - To do what ? He replied. I let the elephants sleep.</p><p> </p><p> This Rass always had a pencil in his hand. From time to time he would take an old envelope from his pocket and, for two or three minutes, write on it.</p><p> </p><p> Travel impression? No ! Once he handed it to me. I read :</p><p> </p><p> One day when I went out cheerfully</p><p> ﻿From the canteen</p><p> When I was in the regiment ...</p><p> I saw the matutine star!</p><p> </p><p> He did a dozen like that each afternoon, bringing everything back to quatrains, couplets, even without the collaboration of Mac Orlan. Was a phonograph playing: If my verses had wings, by Raynaldo Hahn? He composed:</p><p> </p><p> If the cows had wings</p><p> We would see them in the blue sky</p><p> Teasing with the tip of their tails</p><p> The fine snout of the swallows.</p><p> </p><p> An hour later he came to show you that he had added a line. It was :</p><p> </p><p> Cows only have udders.</p><p> Gabon's approach changed the tone of its poetry. He advised all young colonialists not to stop in Gabon and the quatrain ended as follows:</p><p> </p><p> Rather, a vagabond stays all of life!</p><p> The next day Europe dropped anchor in front of Libreville. It was Gabon.</p><p> </p><p> Rass was no longer writing. From the boat he looked at the country. That! he said to me, it is the church; a little higher it was our house and behind: the cemetery.</p><p> </p><p> He had lived here with a Gabonese woman. The Gabonese are to the people of Africa what the Japanese used to be in the Far East: the small allies. We order them, they come to find you in Congo, in Dahomey, further…</p><p> </p><p> - Me, said Rass, I was in the Oubangui Chari… I had sent funds to a comrade and had said to him: send me one. Two months later, one evening at the club, when I no longer thought of that, we saw a girl from another country arrive, dressed as a fair monkey and perched on Louis XV heels. She looked at the men and said: "Me come to find Missié Ass".</p><p> </p><p> - Rass! she's your Gabonese, shouted the Club people.</p><p> </p><p> - Hey! well ! approach, I said.</p><p> </p><p> She stepped forward, greeted me and said: Here is your wife.</p><p> </p><p> It began thus and lasted eight years. They poisoned me!</p><p> </p><p> - Who ?</p><p> </p><p> - Hey! the old matrons because the little one didn't want to leave her white. It was slow! I saw her for two months during her life. She said: I'm going to die, but I'll leave your laundry in order. We don't forget a Gabonese woman. I have never set foot in Libreville since.</p><p> </p><p> - Land with me, Rass, you will show me around the country.</p><p> </p><p> - Well ! Yes ! I'm coming this time!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The colonial towns on the coast resemble these sheepfolds for children minus sheep; some houses put anywhere, some trees, some characters. Rass immediately took me to church. There was no one. Our saints and saints, no doubt affected by the climate, had lost their colors. Up to the blue of the belt of Notre Dame de Lourdes which was sickly pale. Rass neglected the chairs in the front rows, went to one of the back benches, looked around a bit, stopped and said: It was his place! And there, standing, helmet in hand, he closed his eyes.Was he praying? Were his thoughts secular? From Monte Carlo roulette to this church under the equator! The man came back to earth, joined me and said:</p><p> </p><p> - No medicine could have saved her, none! Yet I tried everything!</p><p> </p><p> We left the church. Rass was taking me to their house. A Gabonese woman followed by a negro who seemed to want to place her in the new landed soldiers was leaving on her high heels, her black legs in yellow silk stockings and swaying through a soft pink dress, a body otherwise to sell, at least to rent, in any case not to be despised.</p><p> </p><p> - Don't touch it! said Rass. I have too much friendship for you. When we go there we never come back.</p><p> </p><p> And as if speaking to himself:</p><p> </p><p> - It went up every day by this way coming from the market to our house and when its carrier deposited its purchases on the table she said to me: The best of the market for the best of my heart! And the days of the mail from France! Here are flowers from your country, she murmured, I go out, so that you can breathe them better.</p><p> </p><p> Rass no longer felt the overwhelming heat. He hurried on, marching to attack his past.</p><p> </p><p> - A little higher and it's our house, you'll see! Oh ! he said, stopping in front of a wall, it had been started eight years ago and it is notnot yet finished! And turning around: There! It was here. The little girl was still at this window, and, seeing me coming, she cried to me from a distance: Vao! Vao! It didn't mean anything, it was a cry to her.</p><p> </p><p> An old negress, attracted by the sound of voices, put her gray head to one of the windows. Rass remained frozen when he saw her.</p><p> </p><p> - And besides, he said, they occupied the house!</p><p> </p><p> - Bonjou! Missié Ass, welcome!</p><p> </p><p> - So it was to get the house, old witch?</p><p> </p><p> - Welcome !</p><p> </p><p> - Old guenon!</p><p> </p><p> - Ti can come in if you want.</p><p> </p><p> - Old crow!</p><p> </p><p> Becoming a negro from the coast, Rass spat to better punctuate his contempt.</p><p> </p><p> - So, Urope come back?</p><p> </p><p> Rass trained me. He was shivering.</p><p> </p><p> - You understand, I was not rich, her aunts - and the old nest egg from the window, is one - would have liked to get more out of the little one. They thus inherited the house and the rascals. But what did they make him swallow ...</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! Are you going to the cemetery?</p><p> </p><p> The old woman, with this cry, accompanied our march.</p><p> </p><p> - Go to the cemetery! at the cemetery ! at the cemetery !</p><p> </p><p> - You see, said Rass, the negro or it is to be protected or it is to be strangled!</p><p> </p><p> The walk was strenuous. There is no pleasure in stretching your legs in this country. I wish I could sit somewhere and drink, drink. We were going to the cemetery.</p><p> </p><p> - I shouldn't have come down, said Rass, now she attracts me, I'm still going where she wants. Ask everyone who has had Gabonese women, ask! I would have taken her to France very well.</p><p> </p><p> We came to the land of the dead. Rass searched for his grave . He had laid bricks in the past, but the tornadoes had to fix it in their own way ...</p><p> </p><p> He found the place where his Equatorial slept. I crouch on a nearby grave.</p><p> </p><p> - She was not born on the coast but in the forest, he dreamed aloud.</p><p> </p><p> He kept the secret of this difference to himself.</p><p> </p><p> As I looked tired:</p><p> </p><p> - We have come a long way to come and see her at the cemetery, she had done more when she came to find me in Oubangui-Chari.</p><p> </p><p> A moment passed:</p><p> </p><p> - See! he said to me, it is still all in my mind.</p><p> </p><p> Something was written on the bricks, I put my head forward.</p><p> </p><p> To my Gabonese</p><p> Rass said simply. He added :</p><p> - I could also have engraved: Spirit without shadow, heart without falsehood .</p><p> </p><p> The European whistled his first shot. We were not for Gabon but for the Congo. I straightened up. We spun.</p><p> </p><p> At the bottom of the hill, at the entrance to the path leading to the wharf, a negro, on seeing us, raised his arms and ran in our direction.</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! Zean, said the negro, stopping in front of Rass.</p><p> </p><p> "My little Pierre," said Rass, hugging the negro.</p><p> </p><p> The negro explained that he had known that Europe had brought Rass and that for three hours he had been looking for him.</p><p> </p><p> I left them.</p><p> </p><p> The boat back impatient, I shouted:</p><p> </p><p> - Hey! Rass! It's time.</p><p> </p><p> White and black joined me.</p><p> </p><p> "Make me come," said the black man to Rass.</p><p> </p><p> The two friends separated.</p><p> </p><p> The boat carried us away.</p><p> </p><p> - Yes. As soon as installed, Rass replied to the other, who remained at the quay. Goodbye, little Pierre.</p><p> </p><p> - Make me come, Zean! Zean!</p><p> </p><p> Rass having stopped waving his arm in his honor, said to me: He was his brother!</p><p> </p><p> Here we are. By dint of advancing, Africa has changed its name. Ecuador is crossed. It is no longer A. O. F., but A. E. F. The falling night sees us disembarking at Pointe-Noire. It's the Congo.</p><p> </p><p> This future city should be called Pointe-Silence! The wharf ends up in the bush. Grass grows up to your chest and you go, looking for a path that is said to exist.</p><p> </p><p> Pointe-Noire is not yet open to the public. Travelers to the Congo don't stay there. They continue on the boat to Matadi, at the home of the Belgians, who have made a railway. The French, across the territory of our friends, will reach the French Congo.</p><p> </p><p> Pointe-Noire will be our port of tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p> Tomorrow, five hundred and two kilometers of railroad will link Brazzaville, our capital, to Pointe-Noire, our outlet.</p><p> </p><p> Tomorrow!</p><p> </p><p> But today ?</p><p> </p><p> Today we must speak. France has the right to know. A drama is playing out here. Its title is: Congo-Océan .</p><p> </p><p> After years of a long sleep, French Equatorial Africa heard a man shout at him: "Get up! This man was called Victor Augagneur. Having noticed that our empire was dying, suffocated, the proconsul decided to cut the throat of Africa, from Brazzaville to Pointe-Noire, to pass him the liberating railway.</p><p> </p><p> Mr. Victor Augagneur only had time to say and not time to act. He returned to France.</p><p> </p><p> M. Antonetti succeeded him. The new proconsul examined the patient. Having judged the intervention essential, he rolled up his sleeves and started.</p><p> </p><p> What kind of man was Mr. Antonetti? The best. Keen on intelligence, quick in decisions, stimulated and not overwhelmed by the size of a task. He arrived preceded and followed by his success in Ivory Coast where, builder of Abidjan, piercer of forests, he had, against nature, opened a country to the activity of the whites. To awaken the palace of Sleeping Beauty, could we choose a more dashing knight? I'm not saying that to please Mr. Antonetti. The biggestpleasure we could give him would be to leave him in peace. But his case illustrates the drama. We will see it.</p><p> </p><p> It is little to write that Equatorial Africa was sleeping. She was snoring. It was a general concert of throats and nostrils! France was so far away that her children could afford it without fear of waking her. It was not an armed peace, but a sounding peace. We heard noise, without seeing any agitation. It was the great tom-tom of the sleepers!</p><p> </p><p> M. Antonetti, resuming M. Augagneur's cry, launched: "Stand up!" "</p><p> </p><p> Then everyone moved a member, rubbed their eyes and, in a half-sleep, got up.</p><p> </p><p> "We're going to do the railroad," continued Mr. Antonetti. Did you understand me correctly?</p><p> </p><p> Everyone was half asleep, no one understood.</p><p> </p><p> However, seeing his collaborators on their feet, Mr. Antonetti commanded: "En route!" "</p><p> </p><p> They were sleepwalkers who obeyed!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> French Equatorial Africa is like a house devoid of everything, which would have only its walls and nothing inside, no furniture, no water, no gas, only some old broken chairs. Whena house must become useful, we furnish it. We did not equip the country. Imagine that Mr. Antonetti said, "We have to make bread!" And that the bakers, having no flour and to seem to obey, began to brew in the void! To bring the workforce to Brazzaville, the only way being water, it would have required boats. No boats! From Brazzaville to the head of the site, we should have started by tracing the road. At the beginning, no road! It was a vein! As long as the road was absent, the trucks became useless! As for the negroes, we forgot that these people had a stomach, what stomach even! No food deposit! That they also had bronchi and that bronchitis is always on the alert for naked men. No blankets!</p><p> </p><p> Mr. Antonetti pointed out the inventory. The managers were astonished at such naivety and replied, with the assurance that gives you a life so far peaceful, that everything was fine for the customers.</p><p> </p><p> We attacked.</p><p> </p><p> A contract was made with a public works company. We would give him eight thousand men, they would take over the business. This company was called the Batignolles.</p><p> </p><p> From Congo to Sanga, from Sanga to Chari, we would have thought we were between Place Clichy and Place Villiers: we only heard about Batignolles!</p><p> </p><p> In Moyen Logone, Moyen Chari, Dar and Koutti, Haute-Kato, Bas-Bomou, Gribingui to Oubangui, Oubangui to Pool, the Parisian name fell and bounced.</p><p> </p><p> Bakotas, Bayas, Linfondos, Saras, Bandas, Lisangos, Mabakas, Zindès, Loangos were torn from their contemplation and sent “to the Batignolles”!…</p><p> </p><p> It was a very eccentric journey. The recruits embarked on barges, contemporaneous with our conquest. In this country, the barges were not made for the transport of men but for that of goods, had the round back. Three hundred by three hundred, four hundred by four hundred, the human cargo was piled up and down. Travelers from the inside were suffocating, those from the outdoors could not stand or sit. In addition, not having feet, each day - and the descent to Brazzaville lasted fifteen to twenty days - he slipped one or two in the Chari, in the Sanga or in the Congo. The barge continued. If all the drowned people had to be rescued! ... Was the barge boarding? The branches of the mangroves mowed the highest perches. Not a shelter. A fortnight on a round roof. The sun, the rain. And like thesteam heated with wood, the escarbilles, preventive treatment, making them on the skin of salutary points of fire!</p><p> </p><p> And it was Brazzaville. Out of three hundred, there were two hundred and sixty, sometimes two hundred and eighty! The ? Well ! they stayed on the bank! We had not yet planned a camp. We were thinking about that right now! The sleepers bitten by Antonetti were too busy rubbing their eyes. Everything was still part of the confusion of dreams.</p><p> </p><p> The survivors reformed the herd. The running was about to start. We had chosen the most beautiful men at the beginning. The beast was good, and didn't flinch until the last minute. And the capitas , without too great danger, could experience the solidity of the skins. As for the feet, no one doubted it.</p><p> </p><p> Could we not have done it in another way? Yes.</p><p> </p><p> Wisdom, the right understanding of the effort to be made would have ordered to put these men on the Belgian railroad, then, arrived at Matadi, on a French boat, means which would have, in three days, brought them "to Batignolles" , that is to say in Pointe-Noire, end of the "machine". No ! they would go on foot! We only counted with time and not with life. Thirty more days wereperhaps not a case, but out of two hundred and sixty men, sixty less should have appeared one.</p><p> </p><p> And the herd took the bush, crossed the backwaters, reached the Mayombe, cruel forest. Did the food precede the travelers? One in two. Were they following them? No more ! In any case, if they followed them, they never caught them! The convoys waited in vain for millet and salted fish. Did they sometimes find food stores? The warden was not allowed to feed them, as the walking regulations did not provide for workers to be hungry at this stage. "Hunger!" Hungry! This tragic word went up all the way. On leaving Brazzaville, each man had indeed received ten francs. With these ten francs, the administration estimated that he could walk for days without being hungry! Poor Saras! On leaving the capital, a wise merchant had exchanged the ticket for an iron comb! Did they know, they who knew nothing, that they would not be fed the next day? Now the negro is not yet eating iron! So it was a surprising sight. For ten kilometers, the convoy was nothing more than a long wounded snake, losing its rings, Bayas collapsed, Zindès dragging itself on one foot, and capitas bringing them back to the chicotte.</p><p> </p><p> It still happened!</p><p> </p><p> I saw railways built; we encountered equipment on construction sites. Here, only negro! The negro replaced the machine, the truck, the crane; why not the explosive too?</p><p> </p><p> To carry the barrels of cement of one hundred and three kilos "the Batignolles" had for all material only a stick and the head of two negroes! However, I discovered on these modern sites important instruments: the hammer and the crowbar, for example. In Mayombe, we pierce the tunnels with a hammer and a crowbar!</p><p> </p><p> Exhausted, badly treated by the capitas, far from any European surveillance, (Mr. Colonial Minister, I took some photographs for you, you will not find them in propaganda films), wounded, emaciated, sorry, the negroes died en masse.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> In Moyen Logone, Moyen Chari, Dar el Koutti, Haute-Kato, Bas Bomou, Gribingui, Ouaka, Ouham, Haute-Sanga, Bas-Bangui, N'Goko Sanga, from l'Oubangui to the Pool, husbands, brothers and sons did not return.</p><p> </p><p> It was the great cast of negroes!</p><p> </p><p> The eight thousand men promised to “Batignolles” were soon no more than five thousand, then four thousand, then two thousand. Then seventeen hundred! It was necessary to replace the dead, to recruit again. At that moment, what happened?</p><p> </p><p> This: as soon as a white man set out, the same cry spread: “  The machine!  ". All the negroes knew that the white man came to seek men for the railway; they were fleeing. "You yourself," they said to our missionaries, "have taught us that we should not commit suicide. Gold go to the machineis to run to death. They were reaching the woods, the edges of Chad, the Belgian Congo, Angola. Where men once lived, our recruiters found only chimpanzees. For the honor of the human race, could we build the Congo-Ocean with chimpanzees? We were chasing the fugitives. Our skirmishers caught them in flight, with a lasso, as they could! They were fussing! as we say here. We came to reprisals. Entire villages were punished . Some however escaped these rigors, white commanders of these regions having espoused the cause of these blacks against the whites of Brazzaville! Another time a black chief hanged himself rather than obeying the order to recruit for the machine. Finally, to hide the depopulation, we talked about rectifying the border of Oubangui-Chari!</p><p> </p><p> The human material recruited under these conditions was no longer of first quality. As the means of transport and supplies had not been improved, the waste increased. Barges could have been called hearses and the yards of mass graves. The Gribingui detachment lost seventy-five percent of its workforce. That of Likouala-Mossaka, comprising one thousand two hundred and fifty men, only saw four hundred and twenty-nine return. From Ouesso, on the Sanga, one hundred and seventy-four men were set off. Eighty arrived at Brazzaville, sixty-nine on the site. Three months later, there were thirty-six left.</p><p> </p><p> For the other convoys, the mortality was in these proportions.</p><p> </p><p> "We must accept the sacrifice of six to eight thousand men," said M. Antonetti, "or give up the railway. "</p><p> </p><p> The sacrifice was greater.</p><p> </p><p> To date, however, it does not exceed seventeen thousand. And we only have three hundred kilometers of railroad left to build!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Black Point ! Pretty black!</p><p> </p><p> A Portuguese man, a Petruquet, as the negroes say, built a small kiosk there, it's the hotel, the restaurant, that's all! It is the tent of the shipwrecked.</p><p> </p><p> A phonograph, in the evenings, pours “upward” to the residents: traders attracted by the workforce, site managers, all crushed by the equator and the solitude.</p><p> </p><p> It is the colony at the first age. Pointe-Noire still exists only in hope. Pointe-Noire will have a hundred thousand inhabitants. Pointe-Noire will deliver 3,000 cubic meters of water per day. Pointe-Noire will have eight cranes and will be able to handle 150,000 tonnes per year. Pointe-Noire will not only be the port of Congo, but that of central Africa. Belgians and English will be forced, by the law of the shortest, to go through Pointe-Noire. The treasures of Cape Town, those of Katanga will emerge in Pointe-Noire to gain New York speed! hopefullythat a little of this wealth will also take the road to France!</p><p> </p><p> For now, Pointe-Noire has mainly a lighthouse, a hospital and a customs. Everything you need to attract travelers! The day when the earth has only one man, it will be a customs officer!</p><p> </p><p> Around the Pétruquet shelter, the pioneers lived under the lighthouse. They talk about Paris, which proves that morale is low. As soon as two colonists discuss the number of kiosks planted between the Madeleine and the Opera, the cockroach is in good health! The headlight turns, the cockroach turns, the phonograph turns. Alone, the air is still!</p><p> </p><p> - Monsieur is coming for the railway, said the Petruquet, Monsieur will have a room, Monsieur will have a hurricane lamp, Monsieur will have all the French liquors: champagne,…</p><p> </p><p> - Put rather shutters in your rooms, says a settler, you can't close your eyes with your lighthouse!</p><p> </p><p> - My lighthouse? The lighthouse of France, the lighthouse of the great port of central Africa!</p><p> </p><p> Consumers burst out laughing.</p><p> </p><p> One attacked me:</p><p> </p><p> - Sir, dear colleague, I do not know what attracts you here. Maybe you like what turns,then, you will do as we do, you will go wild! For me, I have not written to my mother for six months! It's like that ! But since you are disembarking, perhaps you can tell us the number of kiosks between the Madeleine and the Opera, on the sidewalk on the right? I say four!</p><p> </p><p> - Three! slashed the neighbor.</p><p> </p><p> I said that passing on the left sidewalk, I did not know.</p><p> </p><p> Le Pétruquet sat down with us and praised our fate.</p><p> </p><p> - Gentlemen, he said, countries are like jobs, the dirtier they are, the more they enrich.</p><p> </p><p> - The more they enrich the Petruquets! Again this beacon! We go crazy. Bring champagne while waiting for the railroad to be finished.</p><p> </p><p> Tired, the man had dropped his head:</p><p> </p><p> - Be finished! he repeated bitterly. Be finished!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Two days later, I had my carriers. From Pointe-Noire I was going to reach Brazzaville and see how the railway was built. Five hundred and two kilometers in perspective. The first seventy-seven will go by themselves, the track is laid, the train is rolling, it arrives at the entrance to the Mayombe, which is a very big bitch in the rainforest. Through it, from time immemorial, has passed the famoustrail called caravan route and joining the Congo river to the Atlantic. Marchand took it during his big business!</p><p> </p><p> From Mayombe, there will be three hundred and two kilometers before reaching Mindouli, head of the other section of railway. There, we will find sixty kilometers of private road belonging to the mining company, these sixty kilometers will lead us to terminal 65, where, from Brazzaville, the colony ended up bringing its rail.</p><p> </p><p> Six am. My twenty-seven Loangos are there. The rifleman serves them millet in their calabash. They are not tall, not strong. I should wear them! They load the boxes of preserves on their heads, they present the tipoye . It is the first time that I ride in an instrument of this kind. I immediately feel that it is not a bed of roses. The carriers put the stretcher on their heads. I understand why these men were chosen to be small: it is to avoid vertigo for customers! And here they are trotting. As for me, seated above them, in my seat bath, my legs hang like those of a puppet and my chest, from top to bottom, comes alive like a mad piston. Fortunately, I will not be prohibited from using my feet!</p><p> </p><p> My crew arrives at the "Machine". My twenty-seven unknown companions are likethey can in wagons full of rails. As for the white compartment, it is cattle! If you want to sit there, you have to bring your chair. They are four whites already, in the "stable". The train is leaving. I quickly learned who these travelers were. The one who did not seem to be sick was an Englishman and a wood cutter on behalf of the "Batignolles". He was reading an old Daily Mailused to make packages. The diary was not complete. When the article he was following ended in a tear, the Englishman groaned. He asked me if I knew wood. I said no. So he got up, held out his hand to me and said, "Tighten! Tighten! I understand he wanted to congratulate me on such ignorance. He said again: "Railroad No? Negro path, yes! », No doubt expressing by this that, on the road, I would find more negroes than sleepers on the road. Then, from a box, he took out cans and ate. The second was an Italian, thin, sick, who lacked two fingers on his right hand. The third was a sick, skinny Frenchman who lacked one finger on his left hand and two on the right. The fourth was a doctor with four stripes going to observe the deaths. The Italian returned from "his" trial at Pointe-Noire and returned to his post at kilometer 81 in Mayombe.</p><p> </p><p> - Do we know when we killed a black man? he said to me. These trials cannot be concluded. All the blacks are ready to be killed, since they can no longer stand up. They are like me. In a few days, when I am no longer there [1] , will my boss be accused of having killed me on the pretext that I have caught my pain on the construction site? These trials are stupid. We don't hit the negroes to kill them but to make them work. Kill? Kill? When my hurricane lamp runs out of oil it goes out; if I blow on it, the flame lasts less. I blew on a negro, I did not kill him. Besides, I'm acquitted.</p><p> </p><p> The French did not yet have a situation. He was going to Brazzaville on foot.</p><p> </p><p> "Make a commission for me," he asked me. See the head doctor and tell him that he is reserving a hospital bed for Menin. He will not be amazed, he knows me.</p><p> </p><p> The train stopped at the end of the rail. We went down between kilometer 77 and kilometer 78, opposite the cement barrel shops. The Saras worked there. Out of ten, six or seven were fine; we could see the skeletons of others. A great disorder marked this first project. We could only hear screaming. An Italian, more ill than the negroes, shouted: "  Bastards! Pigs! ". The capitas repeated the insults like an echo. Two Saras having deposited the barrel of cement, a capita calotta them. They took over. A hundred meters away, they put it down again, a second capita recalotta them. From cap to cap, the cement reached kilometer 80.</p><p> </p><p> The Saras have a tassel on the head, purple markings on their figure draw the shape of the Egyptian headdress, and plaits of flesh hang on their cheeks. They are very big fellows (which makes a skeleton much more impressive). The desolation of their condition seemed to me unnamed. They drag themselves along the path like nostalgic ghosts. The cries, the caps do not revive them. You would think that, dreaming of their distant Oubangui, they are groping for the entrance to a cemetery!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Here's the Mayombe. Tonight we have to sleep there. You have to reach kilometer 82 before nightfall. There, there is a box, it seems. I take a seat in my sitz bath. Tipoys go. Suddenly, they leave the track and sink under trees which I have never seen the like. The forest grabbed us like a tunnel.</p><p> </p><p> Thrill. Then the silence extending like a sound. The night is coming. Up there, I see the box tied up by the vines. I am not alone walkingtowards her ; in front of me, a man, exhausted, also climbs. I catch him, look at him. Do you think two white people meeting in Mayombe are going to kiss? He doesn't say anything to me.</p><p> </p><p> - I'm going to the hut, I said.</p><p> </p><p> He answers :</p><p> </p><p> This is my box, you can put your bed in it.</p><p> </p><p> He enters. I enter. He calls:</p><p> </p><p> - Boy! Boy! My soup!</p><p> </p><p> The boy presents him with a pan. He sits on the step and eats.</p><p> </p><p> - Do you want canned food? I said.</p><p> </p><p> - I have two rotting deer, he replies, they don't tempt me.</p><p> </p><p> - So, wine?</p><p> </p><p> - No !</p><p> </p><p> - You are sick ?</p><p> </p><p> - I'm sick, the negroes are sick, the railroad is sick, God, if he came to the construction sites, would be sick!</p><p> </p><p> He finished his soup, got up and, passing in front of me, said to me in a furious tone:</p><p> </p><p> - Yes, we're sick!</p><p> </p><p> He disappeared, and I heard his body fall on his bed Picot, as a lead [2] .</p><p> </p><p> In the morning, I left. It will take me three daystwenty-five kilometers out of Mayombe. My team is fine. Each time I go down, the skirmisher wants me to go back up in the tipoye. He asks me for cartridges, as if I had a head to have such things! And then why do? Does death need an auxiliary around here? She seems to be doing very well alone! We follow the caravan route. The ground is soft. The carriers leave the mark of their five toes on it. Sometimes the front tipoys slow down. Then the one who carries behind and who is undoubtedly in a hurry says: "Chicotte! Chicotte! The word works; the drafters laugh and, prodded, go faster.</p><p> </p><p> White, in general, does more walking on foot than tipoye. We descend to the climbs, on the soapy slopes, but we climb back into the apparatus to cross the backwaters. Carriers often change the stretcher. They also put it on their head. When the flesh of a shoulder is torn off, the man shows the mark to the skirmisher. So did one of my men. If my skirmisher didn't have cartridges, he had a hand. No doubt he thought the shoulder was still in fairly good condition: he replied with a slap from which the Mayombe sounded.</p><p> </p><p> I changed carriers, to the great excitement of the discipline, and, dominated by the criminal splendor of the forest, I went. From time to time, my slaves would say, “Hi! Hi! Neighing as if they had been horses cheering each other on a climb!</p><p> </p><p> I arrived at the railway path.</p><p> </p><p> The clay was anthropometric earth; we only saw footprints there. There, three hundred negroes from the "Batignolles" struck rocks with hammers. It was the great howl. Capitas transmitted foolish orders with fury, commanding both to attack and to immobilize themselves, to ascend and descend, all chanted by the ordinary: "Go! Saras, come on! The white foremen were Piedmontese, Tuscans, Calabreses, Russians, Poles, Portuguese. It was no longer the Congo-Ocean, but the Congo-Babel. The capitas and militiamen tapped the Saras with all their strength. And the Saras, as if by reflexes, then tapped on the rocks!</p><p> </p><p> - Saras! Saras! Come on! Come on! Saras! Saras!</p><p> </p><p> The Saras looked at me with the eyes of suffering dogs as if I were bringing them oil to soften the burns on their backs!</p><p> </p><p> - Saras! Saras!</p><p> </p><p> The cry accompanied me for a while, then the forest stifled everything.</p><p> </p><p> And I arrived at the mountain of soap. For three hours I was going to behave like the Sisyphus stone. Every hundred meters I slipped and, after having turned like a drunk top, interrupting my ascent, I dive down or sprawl on my back. To make it easier, I took off my shoes. Alas, the soles of my feet were no better than the soles of my boots. But they, the porters, always climbed with thirty kilos on their heads, skilful toes, right chest. Their fatigue was invisible. The negro is an extraordinary machine, barely hard and fragile to the wind.</p><p> </p><p> We reached the summit. We went back down.</p><p> </p><p> - Saras! Saras!</p><p> </p><p> The cry was not chasing me. The forest spoke again. Two hundred negroes, on the path itself, were crouching along a large felled tree. It was a bridge pile. No ropes or straps, the hands of the negroes only for all material. The pile was not advancing. As chiefs: two militiamen, three capitas, not a white man.</p><p> </p><p> - Go to bed! Get laid! (lay down) yelled the officers.</p><p> </p><p> On each side of the tree, a hundred negroes were bent.</p><p> </p><p> - Hands ! Hands !</p><p> </p><p> They put their hands under the pile.</p><p> </p><p> A militiaman counted: "Oune! doe! toâ! And, suddenly seized by a fit of hysteria, possessed by the demon of folly, he ran on this pile which he wanted us to lift and lash the poor curved backs. The backs did not flutter.</p><p> </p><p> - Hell! Hell! Hi! Ah! Ah! Ria! Ria! Pousso! Pousso!</p><p> </p><p> The tree was not a meter long.</p><p> </p><p> The militiaman was hitting harder.</p><p> </p><p> Suddenly, probably to come to the aid of his brothers, one of the Saras broke away from the lot, tore off a clump of herbs, shredded it furiously from the teeth and hands, and, a wild song in the mouth, stooping, rising , falling back, getting up, did for a moment the simulacrum of lifting the pile.</p><p> </p><p> - Ria! Ria! Pousso! Pousso!</p><p> </p><p> The pile did not move any more, the capitas rushed on the naked men. They hit them with their feet, with their fists. None protested. In pain, one straightened up, however, and took his hip in his hand. There was a pause and the dance started again. Then, four blacks left the pile and came towards me, showing me crushed fingers. Two others had their faces bloodied by the chicotte. A seventh neck injury.</p><p> </p><p> This method only resulted in screams and sores. I had work stopped by the only right that I was white. And I signed seven hospital vouchers, at least so-called, as if I had been a doctor!</p><p> </p><p> - Ah! said the Saras in such a weary voice, always a hospital!</p><p> </p><p> This took place on April 22, between eleven and noon, on the caravan route, after having crossed the Savon mountain, two kilometers before M'Vouti.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> My negroes cried out with joy.</p><p> </p><p> The misfortune of the Saras and the Bandas did not touch them. They were Loangos. From race to race the black people hate each other. A Sara is a dog for a Loango. I had reached Missafo. Missafo, a shed where you can take shelter on the caravan route. My men's grief was over. A truck was coming to pick me up.</p><p> </p><p> We waited four hours. The wasps, confusing us with flowers, came foraging. May those who eat honey from Mayombe at least give me news!</p><p> </p><p> The truck appeared. A white man jumped on the ground. He was small and as lively as pale.</p><p> </p><p> - Are they your carriers? he said. And, addressing them: "Go! he said, on the way to Montzi ”.</p><p> </p><p> One by one, the Loangos, who had cried out with joy when they saw the liberation truck arrive, marched. The white man threw down his raincoat and ran at full speed to cut them off.The foothills of the Mayombe echoed with very French words. Under the voice and the look of white, the twenty-seven Loangos, like dogs coming to be beaten, joined the hangar.</p><p> </p><p> - This is an opportunity, said my compatriot. A white man has been out of my house for ten days, and all my black people are slamming in Montzi. I don't have medicine. There is a shortage everywhere, so as soon as a box leaves for a post, the other posts visit it and nothing more than cotton arrives! They will transport my white and my dying to M'Vouti. You see, a negro, it fades like a flower! In the evening he is in good health, the next day he trembles; on the third day, he unreasonably; the fourth is finished! I believe that everyone dies of boredom or meningitis. In any case, I have had enough; In the morning, I make the call. They answer: "Sick! I touch their forehead. But I don't know anything about it; I am not a doctor ; I kick them to work in the ... They fall on the site. It is I who seem to have killed them! Do you want to go to Montzi! scoundrels! he shouted to my carriers.</p><p> </p><p> - You know, I said to him, I hired and paid these men only until Missafo.</p><p> </p><p> - I don't care! Skirmisher! I make you responsible; if in two hours the Loangos are not in Montzi, you will hear from me!</p><p> </p><p> A skeleton at this moment appeared on the road, using a long stick to advance.</p><p> </p><p> - Hold ! look at the one coming down, it's one of mine. I send it to M'Vouti's infirmary. He will not survive. He's already a ghost. What do you want me to do about it? For me, it's meningitis. They all go crazy.</p><p> </p><p> Let us say that the negroes are suffering from the disease of the "machine"! We knew the recurrent, the vomito negro, the bilious. Between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville has just exploded "machinitis"! They lose weight, dry out, lose their senses and collapse. The pickaxe seems to weigh a hundred pounds in the hand of the Saras. Only the weight of the instrument scratches the ground. They no longer have the strength to join! Terrassiers? No ! Automata at the end of their spring!</p><p> </p><p> We all won Montzi.</p><p> </p><p> Indeed, the state of public health was not remarkable. The fresh air here smelled of hospital. In ten bags, ten tottering Saras were laid. We hung these bags on a stick. Each stick was loaded on the shoulder of two Loangos. The dying then left for M'Vouti. This duty accomplished, one began to open the cans when the tiraillour appeared at the entrance of the hut.</p><p> </p><p> - Commanding officer ! Loangos fucked up Saras on the ground, Loangos cavalés, report to me!</p><p> </p><p> The rifleman had told the truth. Our porters had thrown the dying into the first ditch. The poor Saras were whining over each other. The one below was dead. The lives of the survivors were all in the white of their eyes. Fucking Africa!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Ecuador does not pass rue Oudinot. However, some news from the Congo-Ocean reached the Ministry of Colonies. So a man preceded me by a few days on the road from Pointe-Noire to Brazzaville. His name was Mr. Lasnet, and practiced the profession of Inspector General of the health service. Inspector General, you certainly missed a great show. We organized it especially for you. Did you come on the faith of the bad guys who claimed that the negroes were dying on the "Batignolles" construction sites? We were going to show you how we treated them.</p><p> </p><p> The day you landed in Pointe-Noire, model detachments were formed in Brazzaville. At the same time, the Mayombe site managers hid the wretches in the forest. We choose the most beautiful males waiting at Brazza. Each was dressed in a khaki costume which, for eight days, had been made in a hurry. We gave them a blanket of one kilo five hundred grams, a musette garnished with a plate, a spoon, a packet of tea! Then a soap and a towel. So that the towel does not escape your eyes, we did not put it in the bag, but on it. At seven in the morning, they took the train: covered wagon. Fresh and shiny, they arrived at kilometer 92. They slept in Goma-Biolo. The next day, a small stage of 26 kilometers to Mindouli. In Mindouli, two days of rest. There, fourteen vans were waiting. Each van took six Negroes. And the first detachment, 84 men, went to meet you, each man having received a cold meal: boxes of pâté, sardines. All they needed was a hot water bottle under their feet and a good cigar! It is true that they smoked tea! At four o'clock, they arrived in Madingou, where a hot meal, under the supervision of a white lady, was prepared. This is where, Mr. Inspector General, you should meet them.</p><p> </p><p> Where have you been ? Which path did you take? You have not crossed the beautiful cavalcade. The skirmisher sergeant, who was the guide, died of despair. Four days later, he was still looking for you outside of Mayombe. He took me for you! I still see him so happy, falling on me, and calling me: my great general commander!</p><p> </p><p> - You're looking for Mr. Lasnet, I said.</p><p> </p><p> - Lassinet! Yes, the great general Lassinet!</p><p> </p><p> - Old man, he's already in Brazzaville.</p><p> </p><p> He dropped his attention!</p><p> </p><p> - Me, damn! Me scum! Me, never again a medalist! he said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> I continued on the road. After the Mayombe, I had nothing to do. Over more than 300 kilometers, work has not yet started. The Congo-Ocean drama, which begins in Chad and in the Oubangui-Chari, comes to unravel in Mayombe.</p><p> </p><p> I saw everything again. The exhausted whites, whose only business was to finish their contract. None of them had been able to speak to me for a long time, it seemed like they lacked the breath. To my requests, they responded with a weary gesture. They were men at the end of resistance. The rainforest had undermined them. They only smiled when talking about the completion of the line. And when I said that the railroad had to be made, they replied: "Not by us! "</p><p> </p><p> I could see the dismay of the construction sites, a small crowbar attacking the giant rocks, the Saras could no longer lift the shovel of earth, the ruthless black foremen, and the chief of the site, his soup swallowed, falling from a block onto the stretched canvas which served as his bed.</p><p> </p><p> I heard the wild cries of the furious capitas, the "Ria-ria!" Pousso! pousso! "Go! Saras! Come on! come on! And I saw the Saras, the Zindès and the Bayas no longer having the strength to push themselves to go and die in the forest.</p><p> </p><p> I saw the director of the "Batignolles" company shrug his shoulders in his house in Pointe-Noire and I heard him fixing the date of the inauguration of the Congo-Ocean after the death of his successor, "again," he said. , if he comes here very young and we have changed our method ”.</p><p> </p><p> I thought that between October 1926 and December 1927, thirty thousand blacks had crossed Brazzaville "for the machine", and that we only encountered one thousand seven hundred between the river and the Ocean!</p><p> </p><p> I repeated to myself that, on the other side, the Belgians had just built 1,200 kilometers of railroad in three years, with losses not exceeding three thousand dead, and that with us, for 140 kilometers, it had taken ten- seven thousand corpses!</p><p> </p><p> I thought that if the Frenchman were a little less interested in the elections of his borough councilor, perhaps he would have, like all other colonial peoples, the curiosity of the things of his empire and that then his representatives par- beyond Ecuador, feeling under the gaze of their country, would wake up for good from such guilty sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Finally, on the tenth day, I touched the village of Brazzaville. Brazzaville is just a village. Opposite, on the other side of the Congo, there is a city, a living modern city, a city, what! Her name is Kinshasa… but she is Belgian!</p><p> </p><p> A heavy peace enveloped Brazzaville. Slowly, the Congo descended, to break on its falls. A giant statue dominated a plateau. It was that of the warrior bishop, Mgr Augouard, who scanned the country. I looked for Brazza; Brazza was not there. France has forgotten it! Two hundred Saras, sleeping standing on their shovel, were working at the future station. A silent "push" passed on its one wheel. I took it and said, "Go! The two horse men led me to the river. I saw that the port was only a steep path cut into an embankment. Two barges with round backs made up our fleet. The "push" started again. In front of an official building, negro women and children from eighty kilometers, laid down loads of cassava, wrapped in banana leaves: supplies for the "machine". Brazzaville was scattered and dead. A slight rib appeared, the "push" slows down. Suddenly an automobile appeared. In thissilence it was indeed an apparition. I looked at it as a great event. I consoled myself for her flight, thinking that she could not go very far since there was no road and that I would see her again. And I arrived opposite the proconsular palace. I got out of my wheelchair. The Governor General's home rested in the sun. No breath animated the tricolor flag. M. Antonetti was there, certainly thinking of the railway. Was I going to enter? What's the point ? I seemed to hear his voice. He called, he ordered, he spoke clearly; but the desert surrounded him, no one answered him: French Equatorial Africa was still sleeping.</p><p> </p><p>  The author has since learned of the death of this Italian.</p><p>  The author has since learned of the man's death.
