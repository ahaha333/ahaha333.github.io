Chapter 3: Remember Landscapes, African-American appropriations of Africa</p><p> Representations of Africa in African-American texts are conditioned by the histories of exile that have been discussed in the preceding chapters, and also by the location of African-Americans in the United States—a nation whose cultural and political dominance has reached global proportions. The position of Black Americans within the nation, although as a dispossessed and marginalised people, is nevertheless a position which confers United States citizenship, structures national identifications and conditions, in ways which are explored in this chapter, the relationship between Black Americans and other diasporic Blacks. </p><p> [Alice Walker’s Possessing the Secret of Joy]’s celebration of the value of anthropology for understanding African culture, taken as a whole, and a human collective Unconscious, recoverable through sympathy, leads the narrative, in fact, to incorporate a vision of Africa within rigidly North American terms. ‘Africa’ emerges as a dying culture; both victim—through the ravages of AIDS (pp. 233–6) and the suffering of circumcised girls—and as its own destroyer—due to the tyrannous collusion of female circumcisers with male sadism. </p><p> Tashi’s voluntary circumcision, brought about by the fervour of nationalist decolonisation and the need to be ‘completely woman. Completely African. Completely Olinkan’ (p. 61), allows the novel to reinscribe colonialism as the possibility of correspondence and unity between the West and Africa. </p><p> Discussing her use of fabricated ‘African’ words, the author claims: ‘Perhaps it, and other words I use, are from an African language I used to know, now tossed up by my unconscious. I do not know from what part of Africa my African ancestors came, and so I claim the continent’ (pp. 267–8). This claiming or appropriation of a whole continent for Walker’s American literary anthropology exposes the difficulties and dangers of a relativism that would seek to deny, not just the significance of cultural difference on a grand scale, but the validity of contextualising and locating where one is speaking from, about whom and with what egotism. </p><p> Possessing the Secret of Joy performs a simultaneous double move by insisting on the alien and deviant principles that dominate and construct African cultural practices, while also claiming the universality of patriarchy and female consciousness. Walker’s use of Jungian psychoanalysis to ground her loosely ethnographic study of Africa allows her to recognise African cultural difference while at the same time denying the psychological implications of this difference. By upholding American feminist consciousness as the ultimate destination for ‘freed’ African women, Walker presents an alternative slave narrative, with the United States as the territory of ‘Northern’ freedom. This use of slavery as the iconography of the text is made explicit in the words of Lisette, who aligns the oppression of women in general terms with the twin motifs of slavery and sexual violence: ‘I recognised the connection between mutilation and enslavement that is at the root of the domination of women in the world’ (p. 131). </p><p> Walker’s representation of Africa, fundamentally a Black American appropriation of Africa to highlight ‘liberated’ American cultural ideals, fails to acknowledge the infusion of American cultural patterns and self understanding that has inevitably occurred amongst diasporic Blacks living in the United States. Walker’s seamless and uncomplicated ‘remembering’ of her African origins in a mystical form of ‘racial memory’ does not take account of the dividing and transforming effects of diasporic movement on a people, the new allegiances that are formed and cherished, alongside the old and prior loyalties that remain to be dreamed. </p><p> Morrison’s statement that her books attempt to show that the meaning of United States’ national identity is inextricably bound up with and created by African-American culture makes two significant claims: the first is that something as distinct and definable as ‘African-American culture’ has been created out of the experience of Diaspora and displacement; the second suggests that the United States—though it is predicated on notions of Western hegemony, of economic, military and cultural imperialism—is, as a nation, inherently defined by its own politically marginalised peoples. </p><p> It is possible to analyse the United States in which Beloved is situated as a place where the present is disrupted by the traumatic incompatibilities of variant cultural pasts </p><p> It is from this instability of cultural signification that the national culture comes to be articulated as a dialectic of various temporalities — modern, colonial, postcolonial, ‘native’ — that cannot be a knowledge that is stabilised in its enunciation (Homi Bhabha, The Location of Culture, p. 152).</p><p> Personal and collective histories survive mortality and repeat, through the aegis of geography and descent, a returning of unspent emotion. An intense focusing on spatial metaphor enacts a poetry of place where suffering and desire continually delineate physical space. </p><p> Beloved theorises a Black conception of the body and of home as realities formed in the shape of past experiences, which insist upon their place in the present through the exigencies of grief and anger. </p><p> History as multiply conceptual, layering land with both White and Black stories, creates circularity and ellipsis; produces an understanding of narrative as collective, broken, sequential and repeating. </p><p> Yearning to transgress a conventional visual/spatial fixing of the Other and the Self, [Minnie Bruce] Pratt seeks to practise new ways of seeing. The panorama of her point of view does not reveal the spread of free space, the expansion of her being-at-home, but exposes division, concealments, hidden narratives of identity and heritage—overlapping,
coinciding, contradicting. </p><p> I learn a way of looking at the world that is more accurate, complex, multi-layered, multi-dimensional, more truthful: to see a world of overlapping circles…instead of the courthouse square with me at the middle (‘Identity: Skin Blood Heart’, Minnie Bruce Pratt, p. 17).</p><p> Pratt’s reading of diverse racial histories becomes a matter of excavation. Cultural geographies demand a reading of imagined and emotional limits, offering different possibilities and levels of narrative. This discovery opens up the world, which shatters light into hidden places, and threatens identity with the loss of stasis and certainty: ‘Instead I felt that I had no place, that, as I moved through my days, I was falling through space’ (p. 27).</p><p> The representation of African-American histories in Beloved through the re-imagining of particularly female slave autobiographies allows an attention to histories of migration and arrival, without allowing the idea of an African origin to spill over into the appropriation of African realities. ‘Africa’, as an original home, exists at the limits of the imagination. It belongs to, and is allowed to remain as, a point of departure, with no conscious remembering of place, territory and landscape. ‘Africa’, in Beloved, has already been metaphorised into the floating space in between Africa and America, where its absence comes to represent a homelessness and restlessness out of which new identifications are formed.</p><p> This dreaming of the Middle Passage as the unfixed yet eternal space from which an African-American origin can be traced makes the wide and uncertain journey away from shore, rather than the reality of Africa’s shore itself, into the founding moment of Black American consciousness. </p><p> The movement which the text encourages between oral (or aural, musical) and visual (literate) scenes, which is readable through the engagement with a jazz aesthetic, is also present in Morrison’s representation of history and definitions as a conflict between oral and literate languages. The contrast staged between oral memories and traditions and the written histories of White America—figured in Bodwin’s approach to ‘the old homestead’—is also evident in the historical journey from plantation to free state, echoing the narratives of ‘freedom’ that characterise the slave autobiographies. </p><p> Morrison’s Song of Solomon elaborates on concepts of racial identity and resistance, revisiting slavery, migration and the slaves’ longing for Africa as a way into reading the relationship between familial and cultural myths, and individual identities. The framing image of Solomon flying back to Africa from the southern plantations lives in a garbled song that underpins the freedom-fighting, the money-making and the familial battles of Milkman Dead. ‘Africa’ remains as a symbol of origins that has more to do with slavery and the South, with discovering the roots of a specifically Black American consciousness, than with a pan-African vision. Beloved is also haunted by an already mediated African identity, born from the Middle Passage and plantation labour, and united in a multivocal collective memory. Both novels emphasise the ambiguous place of Africa as ‘racial memory’, and a cultural origin which is placed in between the United States and Africa, and caught in that contradiction. </p><p> Whether United States Black identity draws its validity from Dr Bledsoe’s leg shackle of slavery, or Ras the Exhorter’s longing for Africa, from class struggle, or from radical, bitter separatism, the results force a continual reorientation of meaning. </p><p> The repeated violent images of Ras the Exhorter [in Ellison’s Invisible Man], with his constant claims for identification with Africa, insist on a specifically racial form of brotherhood (p. 299), becoming dangerously coercive as Ras the Destroyer. ‘Africa’ becomes an image of war, of power and destruction (pp. 447–9), caught in a moment of absolute opposition and violence, which the narrator sees as part of a wider, more sinister operation on behalf of someone else’s propaganda. The novel spirals into a meditation on ‘the beautiful absurdity of…American identity’ (p.480) that continually deals in images and symbols from questionable cultural origins, making Black politics and African-American identifications with Africa, slavery or economics difficult and challenging. </p><p> The slave myth of flying back to Africa over the blank and homeless spaces of the sea is
presented here as a simultaneous retracing of history from present to past realities:</p><p> But she got away from him and headed over here towards the east bluff on her way back to Africa. And she made that trip—some say in body, others in mind (Gloria Naylor, Mama Day p. 206).</p><p> Sapphira’s African and slave identities create her into the founding vision of Willow Springs itself which, neither American nor African, exists in the inbetween, liminal spaces between the two. The idea that it is precisely within these margins, at the cusp of past and present, that an opening to the future can be traced, is an important one for a refiguring of Black narratives in the modern world. Mama Day’s presentiments of the future, between ‘two ticks of the clock’ (p. 138), are linked with her communion with the past and her relationship with the land.</p><p>
