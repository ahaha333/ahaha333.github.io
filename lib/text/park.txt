<p> </p><p> CHAPTER I.JOURNEY FROM PORTSMOUTH TO THE GAMBIA.</p><p> </p><p> SOON after my return from the East Indies in 1793, having learned thatthe noblemen and gentlemen associated for the purpose of prosecuting discoveries in the interior of Africa were desirous of engaging a person to explore that continent, by the way of the Gambia river, I tookoccasion, through means of the President of the Royal Society, to whom Ihad the honour to be known, of offering myself for that service.  I had been informed that a gentleman of the name of Houghton, a captain in thearmy, and formerly fort-major at Goree, had already sailed to the Gambia,under the direction of the Association, and that there was reason toapprehend he had fallen a sacrifice to the climate, or perished in somecontest with the natives.  But this intelligence, instead of deterring mefrom my purpose, animated me to persist in the offer of my services withthe greater solicitude.  I had a passionate desire to examine into theproductions of a country so little known, and to become experimentallyacquainted with the modes of life and character of the natives.  I knewthat I was able to bear fatigue, and I relied on my youth and the strength of my constitution to preserve me from the effects of the climate.  The salary which the committee allowed was sufficiently large, and I made no stipulation for future reward.  If I should perish in myjourney, I was willing that my hopes and expectations should perish withme; and if I should succeed in rendering the geography of Africa morefamiliar to my countrymen, and in opening to their ambition and industry new sources of wealth and new channels of commerce, I knew that I was inthe hands of men of honour, who would not fail to bestow thatremuneration which my successful services should appear to them to merit.The committee of the Association having made such inquiries as theythought necessary, declared themselves satisfied with the qualificationsthat I possessed, and accepted me for the service; and, with thatliberality which on all occasions distinguishes their conduct, gave meevery encouragement which it was in their power to grant, or which Icould with propriety ask.</p><p> </p><p> It was at first proposed that I should accompany Mr. James Willis, whowas then recently appointed consul at Senegambia, and whose countenancein that capacity, it was thought, might have served and protected me; butGovernment afterwards rescinded his appointment, and I lost thatadvantage.  The kindness of the committee, however, supplied all that wasnecessary.  Being favoured by the secretary of the Association, the lateHenry Beaufoy, Esq., with a recommendation to Dr. John Laidley (agentleman who had resided many years at an English factory on the banksof the Gambia), and furnished with a letter of credit on him for £200, Itook my passage in the brig _Endeavour_—a small vessel trading to theGambia for beeswax and ivory, commanded by Captain Richard Wyatt—and Ibecame impatient for my departure.</p><p> </p><p> My instructions were very plain and concise.  I was directed, on myarrival in Africa, “to pass on to the river Niger, either by way ofBambouk, or by such other route as should be found most convenient.  ThatI should ascertain the course, and, if possible, the rise and terminationof that river.  That I should use my utmost exertions to visit theprincipal towns or cities in its neighbourhood, particularly Timbuctooand Houssa; and that I should be afterwards at liberty to return toEurope, either by the way of the Gambia, or by such other route as, underall the then existing circumstances of my situation and prospects, shouldappear to me to be most advisable.”</p><p> </p><p> We sailed from Portsmouth on the 22nd day of May, 1795.  On the 4th ofJune we saw the mountains over Mogadore, on the coast of Africa; and onthe 21st of the same month, after a pleasant voyage of thirty days, weanchored at Jillifrey, a town on the northern bank of the river Gambia,opposite to James’s Island, where the English had formerly a small fort.</p><p> </p><p> The kingdom of Barra, in which the town of Jillifrey is situated,produces great plenty of the necessaries of life; but the chief trade ofthe inhabitants is in salt, which commodity they carry up the river incanoes as high as Barraconda, and bring down in return Indian corn,cotton cloths, elephants’ teeth, small quantities of gold dust, &c.  Thenumber of canoes and people constantly employed in this trade makes theking of Barra more formidable to Europeans than any other chieftain onthe river; and this circumstance probably encouraged him to establishthose exorbitant duties which traders of all nations are obliged to payat entry, amounting to nearly £20 on every vessel, great and small.These duties or customs are generally collected in person by the_alkaid_, or governor of Jillifrey, and he is attended on these occasionsby a numerous train of dependants, among whom are found many who, bytheir frequent intercourse with the English, have acquired a smatteringof our language: but they are commonly very noisy and very troublesome,begging for everything they fancy with such earnestness and importunity,that traders, in order to get quit of them, are frequently obliged togrant their requests.</p><p> </p><p> On the 23rd we departed from Jillifrey, and proceeded to Vintain, a town situated about two miles up a creek on the southern side of the river.This place is much resorted to by Europeans on account of the great quantities of beeswax which are brought hither for sale; the wax iscollected in the woods by the Feloops, a wild and unsociable race of people.  Their country, which is of considerable extent, abounds in rice; and the natives supply the traders, both on the Gambia and Cassamansa rivers, with that article, and also with goats and poultry, on veryreasonable terms.  The honey which they collect is chiefly used bythemselves in making a strong intoxicating liquor, much the same as themead which is produced from honey in Great Britain.</p><p> </p><p> In their traffic with Europeans, the Feloops generally employ a factor oragent of the Mandingo nation, who speaks a little English, and is acquainted with the trade of the river.  This broker makes the bargain; and, with the connivance of the European, receives a certain part only ofthe payment, which he gives to his employer as the whole; the remainder(which is very truly called the _cheating money_) he receives when theFeloop is gone, and appropriates to himself as a reward for his trouble.</p><p> </p><p> The language of the Feloops is appropriate and peculiar; and as theirtrade is chiefly conducted, as hath been observed, by Mandingoes, theEuropeans have no inducement to learn it.</p><p> </p><p> On the 26th we left Vintain, and continued our course up the river,anchoring whenever the tide failed us, and frequently towing the vesselwith the boat.  The river is deep and muddy; the banks are covered withimpenetrable thickets of mangrove; and the whole of the adjacent countryappears to be flat and swampy.</p><p> </p><p> The Gambia abounds with fish, some species of which are excellent food;but none of them that I recollect are known in Europe.  At the entrancefrom the sea sharks are found in great abundance, and, higher up,alligators and the hippopotamus (or river-horse) are very numerous.</p><p> </p><p> In six days after leaving Vintain we reached Jonkakonda, a place ofconsiderable trade, where our vessel was to take in part of her lading.The next morning the several European traders came from their differentfactories to receive their letters, and learn the nature and amount ofher cargo; and the captain despatched a messenger to Dr. Laidley toinform him of my arrival.  He came to Jonkakonda the morning following,when I delivered him Mr. Beaufoy’s letter, and he gave me a kindinvitation to spend my time at his house until an opportunity shouldoffer of prosecuting my journey.  This invitation was too acceptable tobe refused, and being furnished by the Doctor with a horse and guide, Iset out from Jonkakonda at daybreak on the 5th of July, and at eleveno’clock arrived at Pisania, where I was accommodated with a room andother conveniences in the Doctor’s house.</p><p> </p><p> Pisania is a small village in the king of Yany’s dominions, establishedby British subjects as a factory for trade, and inhabited solely by themand their black servants.  It is situated on the banks of the Gambia,sixteen miles above Jonkakonda.  The white residents, at the time of mayarrival there, consisted only of Dr. Laidley, and two gentlemen who werebrothers, of the name of Ainsley; but their domestics were numerous.They enjoyed perfect security under the king’s protection, and beinghighly esteemed and respected by the natives at large, wanted noaccommodation or comfort which the country could supply, and the greatestpart of the trade in slaves, ivory, and gold was in their hands.</p><p> </p><p> Being now settled for some time at my ease, my first object was to learnthe Mandingo tongue, being the language in almost general use throughoutthis part of Africa, and without which I was fully convinced that I nevercould acquire an extensive knowledge of the country or its inhabitants.In this pursuit I was greatly assisted by Dr. Laidley.</p><p> </p><p> In researches of this kind, and in observing the manners and customs ofthe natives, in a country so little known to the nations of Europe, andfurnished with so many striking and uncommon objects of nature, my timepassed not unpleasantly, and I began to flatter myself that I had escapedthe fever, or seasoning, to which Europeans, on their first arrival inhot climates, are generally subject.  But on the 31st of July Iimprudently exposed myself to the night-dew in observing an eclipse ofthe moon, with a view to determine the longitude of the place; the nextday I found myself attacked with a smart fever and delirium, and such anillness followed as confined me to the house during the greatest part ofAugust.  My recovery was very slow, but I embraced every short intervalof convalescence to walk out, and make myself acquainted with theproductions of the country.</p><p> </p><p> In one of those excursions, having rambled farther than usual, on a hotday, I brought on a return of my fever, and on the 10th of September Iwas again confined to my bed.  The fever, however, was not so violent asbefore; and in the course of three weeks I was able, when the weatherwould permit, to renew my botanical excursions; and when it rained, Iamused myself with drawing plants, &c., in my chamber.  The care andattention of Dr. Laidley contributed greatly to alleviate my sufferings;his company and conversation beguiled the tedious hours during thatgloomy season, when the rain falls in torrents; when suffocating heatsoppress by day, and when the night is spent by the terrified travellersin listening to the croaking of frogs (of which the numbers are beyondimagination), the shrill cry of the jackal, and the deep howling of thehyæna, a dismal concert, interrupted only by the roar of such tremendousthunder as no person can form a conception of but those who have heardit.</p><p> </p><p> The country itself being an immense level, and very generally covered with wood, presents a tiresome and gloomy uniformity to the eye; but although Nature has denied to the inhabitants the beauties of romantic landscapes, she has bestowed on them, with a liberal hand, the more important blessings of fertility and abundance.  A little attention to cultivation procures a sufficiency of corn, the fields afford a rich pasturage for cattle, and the natives are plentifully supplied with excellent fish, both from the Gambia river and the Walli creek.</p><p> </p><p> The grains which are chiefly cultivated are—Indian corn (_zea mays_); twokinds of _holcus spicatus_, called by the natives _soono_ and _sanio_;_holcus niger_, and _holcus bicolor_, the former of which they have named_bassi woolima_, and the latter _bassiqui_.  These, together with rice,are raised in considerable quantities; besides which, the inhabitants inthe vicinity of the towns and villages have gardens which produce onions,calavances, yams, cassavi, ground nuts, pompions, gourds, water-melons,and some other esculent plants.</p><p> </p><p> I observed likewise, near the towns, small patches of cotton and indigo.The former of these articles supplies them with clothing, and with thelatter they dye their cloth of an excellent blue colour, in a manner thatwill hereafter be described.</p><p> </p><p> In preparing their corn for food, the natives use a large wooden mortarcalled a _paloon_, in which they bruise the seed until it parts with theouter covering, or husk, which is then separated from the clean corn byexposing it to the wind, nearly in the same manner as wheat is clearedfrom the chaff in England.  The corn thus freed from the husk is returnedto the mortar and beaten into meal, which is dressed variously indifferent countries; but the most common preparation of it among thenations of the Gambia is a sort of pudding which they call _kouskous_.It is made by first moistening the flour with water, and then stirringand shaking it about in a large calabash, or gourd, till it adherestogether in small granules resembling sago.  It is then put into anearthen pot, whose bottom is perforated with a number of small holes; andthis pot being placed upon another, the two vessels are luted togethereither with a paste of meal and water, or with cows’ dung, and placedupon the fire.  In the lower vessel is commonly some animal food andwater, the steam or vapour of which ascends through the perforations inthe bottom of the upper vessel, and softens and the kouskous, which isvery much esteemed throughout all the countries that I visited.  I aminformed that the same manner of preparing flour is very generally usedon the Barbary coast, and that the dish so prepared is there called bythe same name.  It is therefore probable that the negroes borrowed thepractice from the Moors.</p><p> </p><p> Their domestic animals are nearly the same as in Europe.  Swine are foundin the woods, but their flesh is not esteemed.  Probably the markedabhorrence in which this animal is held by the votaries of Mohammed hasspread itself among the pagans.  Poultry of all kinds, the turkeyexcepted, is everywhere to be had.  The guinea-fowl and red partridgeabound in the fields, and the woods furnish a small species of antelope,of which the venison is highly and deservedly prized.</p><p> </p><p> Of the other wild animals in the Mandingo countries, the most common arethe hyæna, the panther, and the elephant.  Considering the use that ismade of the latter in the East Indies, it may be thought extraordinarythat the natives of Africa have not, in any part of this immensecontinent, acquired the skill of taming this powerful and docilecreature, and applying his strength and faculties to the service of man.When I told some of the natives that this was actually done in thecountries of the East, my auditors laughed me to scorn, and exclaimed,“_Tobaubo fonnio_!” (“A white man’s lie!”)  The negroes frequently findmeans to destroy the elephant by firearms; they hunt it principally forthe sake of the teeth, which they transfer in barter to those who sellthem again to the Europeans.  The flesh they eat, and consider it as agreat delicacy.</p><p> </p><p> On the 6th of October the waters of the Gambia were at the greatestheight, being fifteen feet above the high-water mark of the tide, afterwhich they began to subside, at first slowly, but afterwards veryrapidly, sometimes sinking more than a foot in twenty-four hours.  By thebeginning of November the river had sunk to its former level, and thetide ebbed and flowed as usual.  When the river had subsided, and theatmosphere grew dry, I recovered apace, and began to think of mydeparture, for this is reckoned the most proper season for travelling.The natives had completed their harvest, and provisions were everywherecheap and plentiful.</p><p> </p><p> Dr. Laidley was at this time employed in a trading voyage at Jonkakonda.I wrote to him to desire that he would use his interest with the_slatees_, or slave-merchants, to procure me the company and protectionof the first _coffle_ (or caravan) that might leave Gambia for theinterior country; and, in the meantime, I requested him to purchase forme a horse and two asses.  A few days afterwards the Doctor returned toPisania, and informed me that a coffle would certainly go for theinterior in the course of the dry season; but that, as many of themerchants belonging to it had not yet completed their assortment ofgoods, he could not say at what time they would set out.</p><p> </p><p> As the characters and dispositions of the slatees, and people thatcomposed the caravan, were entirely unknown to me—and as they seemedrather averse to my purpose, and unwilling to enter into any positiveengagements on my account—and the time of their departure being withalvery uncertain, I resolved, on further deliberation, to avail myself ofthe dry season, and proceed without them.</p><p> </p><p> Dr. Laidley approved my determination, and promised me every assistancein his power to enable me to prosecute my journey with comfort andsafety.</p><p> </p><p> This resolution having been formed, I made preparations accordingly.</p><p> </p><p> And now, being about to take leave of my hospitable friend (whosekindness and solicitude continued to the moment of my departure), and toquit for many months the countries bordering on the Gambia, it seemsproper, before I proceed with my narrative, that I should in this placegive some account of the several negro nations which inhabit the banks ofthis celebrated river, and the commercial intercourse that subsistsbetween them, and such of the nations of Europe as find their advantagein trading to this part of Africa.  The observations which have occurredto me on both these subjects will be found in the following chapter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER II.LANGUAGE AND RELIGION OF THE NATIVES.</p><p> </p><p> THE natives of the countries bordering on the Gambia, though distributedinto a great many distinct governments, may, I think, be divided intofour great classes—the Feloops, the Jaloffs, the Foulahs, and theMandingoes.  Among all these nations, the religion of Mohammed has made,and continues to make, considerable progress; but in most of them thebody of the people, both free and enslaved, persevere in maintaining theblind but harmless superstitions of their ancestors, and are called bythe Mohammedans _kafirs_, or infidels.</p><p> </p><p> Of the Feloops, I have little to add to what has been observed concerningthem in the former chapter.  They are of a gloomy disposition, and aresupposed never to forgive an injury.  They are even said to transmittheir quarrels as deadly feuds to their posterity, insomuch that a sonconsiders it as incumbent on him, from a just sense of filial obligation,to become the avenger of his deceased father’s wrongs.  If a man loseshis life in one of these sudden quarrels which perpetually occur at theirfeasts, when the whole party is intoxicated with mead, his son, or theeldest of his sons (if he has more than one), endeavours to procure hisfather’s sandals, which he wears _once a year_, on the anniversary of hisfather’s death, until a fit opportunity offers of revenging his fate,when the object of his resentment seldom escapes his pursuit.  Thisfierce and unrelenting disposition is, however, counterbalanced by manygood qualities: they display the utmost gratitude and affection towardstheir benefactors, and the fidelity with which they preserve whatever isentrusted to them is remarkable.  During the present war, they have morethan once taken up arms to defend our merchant vessels from Frenchprivateers; and English property of considerable value has frequentlybeen left at Vintain for a long time entirely under the care of theFeloops, who have uniformly manifested on such occasions the strictesthonesty and punctuality.  How greatly is it to be wished that the mindsof a people so determined and faithful could be softened and civilised bythe mild and benevolent spirit of Christianity!</p><p> </p><p> The Jaloffs (or Yaloffs) are an active, powerful, and warlike race,inhabiting great part of that tract which lies between the river Senegaland the Mandingo states on the Gambia; yet they differ from theMandingoes not only in language, but likewise in complexion and features.The noses of the Jaloffs are not so much depressed, nor the lips soprotuberant, as among the generality of Africans; and although their skinis of the deepest black, they are considered by the white traders as themost sightly negroes on this part of the continent.</p><p> </p><p> Their language is said to be copious and significant, and is often learntby Europeans trading to Senegal.</p><p> </p><p> The Foulahs (or Pholeys), such of them at least as reside near theGambia, are chiefly of a tawny complexion, with soft silky hair, andpleasing features.  They are much attached to a pastoral life, and haveintroduced themselves into all the kingdoms on the windward coast asherdsmen and husbandmen, paying a tribute to the sovereign of the countryfor the lands which they hold.  Not having many opportunities, however,during my residence at Pisania, of improving my acquaintance with thesepeople, I defer entering at large into their character until a fitteroccasion occurs, which will present itself when I come to Bondou.</p><p> </p><p> The Mandingoes, of whom it remains to speak, constitute, in truth, thebulk of the inhabitants in all those districts of Africa which I visited;and their language, with a few exceptions, is universally understood andvery generally spoken in that part of the continent.</p><p> </p><p> They are called Mandingoes, I conceive, as having originally migratedfrom the interior state of Manding, of which some account will hereafterbe given.</p><p> </p><p> In every considerable town there is a chief magistrate, called the_alkaid_, whose office is hereditary, and whose business it is topreserve order, to levy duties on travellers, and to preside at allconferences in the exercise of local jurisdiction and the administrationof justice.  These courts are composed of the elders of the town (of freecondition), and are termed _palavers_; and their proceedings areconducted in the open air with sufficient solemnity.  Both sides of aquestion are freely canvassed, witnesses are publicly examined, and thedecisions which follow generally meet with the approbation of thesurrounding audience.</p><p> </p><p> As the negroes have no written language of their own, the general rule ofdecision is an appeal to _ancient custom_; but since the system ofMohammed has made so great progress among them, the converts to thatfaith have gradually introduced, with the religious tenets, many of thecivil institutions of the prophet; and where the Koran is not foundsufficiently explicit, recourse is had to a commentary called _AlSharra_, containing, as I was told, a complete exposition or digest ofthe Mohammedan laws, both civil and criminal, properly arranged andillustrated.</p><p> </p><p> This frequency of appeal to written laws, with which the pagan nativesare necessarily unacquainted, has given rise in their palavers to (what Ilittle expected to find in Africa) professional advocates, or expoundersof the law, who are allowed to appear and to plead for plaintiff ordefendant, much in the same manner as counsel in the law-courts of GreatBritain.  They are Mohammedan negroes, who have made, or affect to havemade, the laws of the prophet their peculiar study; and if I may judgefrom their harangues, which I frequently attended, I believe, that in theforensic qualifications of procrastination and cavil, and the arts ofconfounding and perplexing a cause, they are not always surpassed by theablest pleaders in Europe.  While I was at Pisania, a cause was heardwhich furnished the Mohammedan lawyers with an admirable opportunity ofdisplaying their professional dexterity.  The case was this:—An assbelonging to a Serawoolli negro (a native of an interior country near theriver Senegal) had broke into a field of corn belonging to one of theMandingo inhabitants, and destroyed great part of it.  The Mandingohaving caught the animal in his field, immediately drew his knife and cuthis throat.  The Serawoolli thereupon called a _palaver_ (or in Europeanterms, _brought an action_) to recover damages for the loss of his beast,on which he set a high value.  The defendant confessed he had killed theass, but pleaded a _set-off_, insisting that the loss he had sustained bythe ravage in his corn was equal to the sum demanded for the animal.  Toascertain this fact was the point at issue, and the learned advocatescontrived to puzzle the cause in such a manner that, after a hearing ofthree days, the court broke up without coming to any determination uponit; and a second palaver was, I suppose, thought necessary.</p><p> </p><p> The Mandingoes, generally speaking, are of a mild, sociable, and obligingdisposition.  The men are commonly above the middle size, well-shaped,strong, and capable of enduring great labour.  The women aregood-natured, sprightly, and agreeable.  The dress of both sexes iscomposed of cotton cloth of their own manufacture: that of the men is aloose frock, not unlike a surplice, with drawers which reach half-waydown the leg; and they wear sandals on their feet, and white cotton capson their heads.  The women’s dress consists of two pieces of cloth, eachof which is about six feet long and three broad.  One of these they wrapround their waist, which, hanging down to the ankles, answers the purposeof a petticoat; the other is thrown negligently over the bosom andshoulders.</p><p> </p><p> This account of their clothing is indeed nearly applicable to the nativesof all the different countries in this part of Africa; a peculiarnational mode is observable only in the head-dresses of the women.</p><p> </p><p> Thus, in the countries of the Gambia, the females wear a sort of bandage,which they call _jalla_.  It is a narrow strip of cotton cloth wrappedmany times round, immediately over the forehead.  In Bondou, the head isencircled with strings of white beads, and a small plate of gold is wornin the middle of the forehead.  In Kasson the ladies decorate their headsin a very tasteful and elegant manner with white seashells.  In Kaartaand Ludamar, the women raise their hair to a great height by the additionof a pad (as the ladies did formerly in Great Britain), which theydecorate with a species of coral brought from the Red Sea by pilgrimsreturning from Mecca, and sold at a great price.</p><p> </p><p> In the construction of their dwelling-houses the Mandingoes also conformto the general practice of the African nations in this part of thecontinent, contenting themselves with small and incommodious hovels.  Acircular mud wall, about four feet high, upon which is placed a conicalroof, composed of the bamboo cane, and thatched with grass, forms alikethe palace of the king and the hovel of the slave.  Their householdfurniture is equally simple.  A hurdle of canes placed upon uprightsticks, about two feet from the ground, upon which is spread a mat orbullock’s hide, answers the purpose of a bed; a water jar, some earthenpots for dressing their food; a few wooden bowls and calabashes, and oneor two low stools, compose the rest.</p><p> </p><p> As every man of free condition has a plurality of wives, it is foundnecessary (to prevent, I suppose, matrimonial disputes) that each of theladies should be accommodated with a hut to herself; and all the hutsbelonging to the same family are surrounded by a fence constructed ofbamboo canes, split and formed into a sort of wicker-work.  The wholeenclosure is called a _sirk_, or _surk_.  A number of these enclosures,with narrow passages between them, form what is called a town; but thehuts are generally placed without any regularity, according to thecaprice of the owner.  The only rule that seems to be attended to isplacing the door towards the south-west, in order to admit thesea-breeze.</p><p> </p><p> In each town is a large stage called the _bentang_, which answers thepurpose of a public hall or town house.  It is composed of interwovencanes, and is generally sheltered from the sun by being erected in theshade of some large tree.  It is here that all public affairs aretransacted and trials conducted; and here the lazy and indolent meet tosmoke their pipes, and hear the news of the day.  In most of the townsthe Mohammedans have also a _missura_, or mosque, in which they assembleand offer up their daily prayers, according to the rules of the Koran.</p><p> </p><p> In the account which I have thus given of the natives, the reader mustbear in mind that my observations apply chiefly to persons of _freecondition_, who constitute, I suppose, not more than one-fourth part ofthe inhabitants at large.  The other three-fourths are in a state ofhopeless and hereditary slavery, and are employed in cultivating theland, in the care of cattle, and in servile offices of all kinds, much inthe same manner as the slaves in the West Indies.  I was told, however,that the Mandingo master can neither deprive his slave of life, nor sellhim to a stranger, without first calling a palaver on his conduct, or inother words, bringing him to a public trial.  But this degree ofprotection is extended only to the native or domestic slave.  Captivestaken in war, and those unfortunate victims who are condemned to slaveryfor crimes or insolvency—and, in short, all those unhappy people who arebrought down from the interior countries for sale—have no securitywhatever, but may be treated and disposed of in all respects as the ownerthinks proper.  It sometimes happens, indeed, when no ships are on thecoast, that a humane and considerate master incorporates his purchasedslaves among his domestics; and their offspring at least, if not theparents, become entitled to all the privileges of the native class.</p><p> </p><p> The earliest European establishment on this celebrated river was afactory of the Portuguese, and to this must be ascribed the introductionof the numerous words of that language which are still in use among thenegroes.  The Dutch, French, and English afterwards successivelypossessed themselves of settlements on the coast; but the trade of theGambia became, and continued for many years, a sort of monopoly in thehands of the English.  In the travels of Francis Moore is preserved anaccount of the Royal African Company’s establishments in this river inthe year 1730; at which the James’s factory alone consisted of agovernor, deputy-governor, and two other principal officers; eightfactors, thirteen writers, twenty inferior attendants and tradesmen; acompany of soldiers, and thirty-two negro servants; besides sloops,shallops, and boats, with their crews; and there were no less than eightsubordinate factories in other parts of the river.</p><p> </p><p> The trade with Europe, by being afterwards laid open, was almostannihilated.  The share which the subjects of England at this time holdin it supports not more than two or three annual ships; and I am informedthat the gross value of British exports is under £20,000.  The French andDanes still maintain a small share, and the Americans have lately sent afew vessels to the Gambia by way of experiment.</p><p> </p><p> The commodities exported to the Gambia from Europe consist chiefly offirearms and ammunition, iron-ware, spirituous liquors, tobacco, cottoncaps, a small quantity of broadcloth, and a few articles of themanufacture of Manchester; a small assortment of India goods, with someglass beads, amber, and other trifles, for which are taken in exchangeslaves, gold dust, ivory, beeswax, and hides.  Slaves are the chiefarticle, but the whole number which at this time are annually exportedfrom the Gambia by all nations is supposed to be under one thousand.</p><p> </p><p> Most of these unfortunate victims are brought to the coast in periodicalcaravans; many of them from very remote inland countries, for thelanguage which they speak is not understood by the inhabitants of themaritime districts.  In a subsequent part of my work I shall give thebest information I have been able to collect concerning the manner inwhich they are obtained.  On their arrival at the coast, if no immediateopportunity offers of selling them to advantage, they are distributedamong the neighbouring villages, until a slave ship arrives, or untilthey can be sold to black traders, who sometimes purchase on speculation.In the meanwhile, the poor wretches are kept constantly fettered, two andtwo of them being chained together, and employed in the labours of thefield, and, I am sorry to add, are very scantily fed, as well as harshlytreated.  The price of a slave varies according to the number ofpurchasers from Europe, and the arrival of caravans from the interior;but in general I reckon that a young and healthy male, from sixteen totwenty-five years of age, may be estimated on the spot from £18 to £20sterling.</p><p> </p><p> The negro slave-merchants, as I have observed in the former chapter, arecalled slatees, who, besides slaves, and the merchandise which they bringfor sale to the whites, supply the inhabitants of the maritime districtswith native iron, sweet-smelling gums and frankincense, and a commoditycalled _shea-toulou_, which, literally translated, signifies_tree-butter_.</p><p> </p><p> In payment of these articles, the maritime states supply the interiorcountries with salt, a scarce and valuable commodity, as I frequently andpainfully experienced in the course of my journey.  Considerablequantities of this article, however, are also supplied to the inlandnatives by the Moors, who obtain it from the salt pits in the GreatDesert, and receive in return corn, cotton cloth, and slaves.</p><p> </p><p> In their early intercourse with Europeans the article that attracted mostnotice was iron.  Its utility, in forming the instruments of war andhusbandry, make it preferable to all others, and iron soon became themeasure by which the value of all other commodities was ascertained.Thus, a certain quantity of goods, of whatever denomination, appearing tobe equal in value to a bar of iron, constituted, in the traders’phraseology, a bar of that particular merchandise.  Twenty leaves oftobacco, for instance, were considered as a bar of tobacco; and a gallonof spirits (or rather half spirits and half water) as a bar of rum, a barof one commodity being reckoned equal in value to a bar of anothercommodity.</p><p> </p><p> As, however, it must unavoidably happen that, according to the plenty orscarcity of goods at market in proportion to the demand, the relativevalue would be subject to continual fluctuation, greater precision hasbeen found necessary; and at this time the current value of a single barof any kind is fixed by the whites at two shillings sterling.  Thus, aslave whose price is £15, is said to be worth 150 bars.</p><p> </p><p> In transactions of this nature it is obvious that the white trader hasinfinitely the advantage over the African, whom, therefore, it isdifficult to satisfy, for conscious of his own ignorance, he naturallybecomes exceedingly suspicious and wavering; and, indeed, so veryunsettled and jealous are the negroes in their dealings with the whites,that a bargain is never considered by the European as concluded until thepurchase money is paid and the party has taken leave.</p><p> </p><p> Having now brought together such general observations on the country andits inhabitants as occurred to me during my residence in the vicinity ofthe Gambia, I shall detain the reader no longer with introductory matter,but proceed, in the next chapter, to a regular detail of the incidentswhich happened, and the reflections which arose in my mind, in the courseof my painful and perilous journey, from its commencement until my returnto the Gambia.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER III.THE KINGDOM OF WOOLLI—JOURNEY TO BONDOU.</p><p> </p><p> ON the 2nd of December, 1795, I took my departure from the hospitablemansion of Dr. Laidley.  I was fortunately provided with a negro servantwho spoke both the English and Mandingo tongues.  His name was Johnson.He was a native of this part of Africa, and having in his youth beenconveyed to Jamaica as a slave, he had been made free, and taken toEngland by his master, where he had resided many years, and at lengthfound his way back to his native country.  As he was known to Dr.Laidley, the Doctor recommended him to me, and I hired him as myinterpreter, at the rate of ten bars monthly to be paid to himself, andfive bars a month to be paid to his wife during his absence.  Dr. Laidleyfurthermore provided me with a negro boy of his own, named Demba, asprightly youth, who, besides Mandingo, spoke the language of theSerawoollies, an inland people (of whom mention will hereafter be made)residing on the banks of the Senegal; and to induce him to behave well,the Doctor promised him his freedom on his return, in case I shouldreport favourably of his fidelity and services.  I was furnished with ahorse for myself (a small but very hardy and spirited beast, which costme to the value of £7 10s), and two asses for my interpreter and servant.My baggage was light, consisting chiefly of provisions for two days; asmall assortment of beads, amber, and tobacco, for the purchase of afresh supply as I proceeded; a few changes of linen, and other necessaryapparel; an umbrella, a pocket sextant, a magnetic compass, and athermometer; together with two fowling-pieces, two pair of pistols, andsome other small articles.</p><p> </p><p> A free man (a _bashreen_, or Mohammedan) named Madiboo, who wastravelling to the kingdom of Bambara, and two slatees, or slavemerchants, of the Serawoolli nation, and of the same sect, who were goingto Bondou, offered their services, as far as they intended respectivelyto proceed, as did likewise a negro named Tami (also a Mohammedan), anative of Kasson, who had been employed some years by Dr. Laidley as ablacksmith, and was returning to his native country with the savings ofhis labours.  All these men travelled on foot, driving their asses beforethem.</p><p> </p><p> Thus I had no less than six attendants, all of whom had been taught toregard me with great respect, and to consider that their safe returnhereafter to the countries on the Gambia would depend on my preservation.</p><p> </p><p> Dr. Laidley himself, and Messrs. Ainsley, with a number of theirdomestics, kindly determined to accompany me the first two days; and Ibelieve they secretly thought they should never see me afterwards.</p><p> </p><p> We reached Jindey the same day, having crossed the Walli creek, a branchof the Gambia, and rested at the house of a black woman, who had formerlybeen the paramour of a white trader named Hewett, and who, in consequencethereof, was called, by way of distinction, _seniora_.  In the evening wewalked out to see an adjoining village, belonging to a slatee namedJemaffoo Momadoo, the richest of all the Gambia traders.  We found him athome, and he thought so highly of the honour done him by this visit, thathe presented us with a fine bullock, which was immediately killed, andpart of it dressed for our evening’s repast.</p><p> </p><p> The negroes do not go to supper till late, and, in order to amuseourselves while our beef was preparing, a Mandingo was desired to relatesome diverting stories, in listening to which, and smoking tobacco, wespent three hours.  These stories bear some resemblance to those in theArabian Nights’ Entertainments, but, in general, are of a more ludicrouscast.</p><p> </p><p> About one o’clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of December, I took myleave of Dr. Laidley and Messrs. Ainsley, and rode slowly into the woods.I had now before me a boundless forest, and a country, the inhabitants ofwhich were strangers to civilised life, and to most of whom a white manwas the object of curiosity or plunder.  I reflected that I had partedfrom the last European I might probably behold, and perhaps quitted forever the comforts of Christian society.  Thoughts like these wouldnecessarily cast a gloom over my mind; and I rode musing along for aboutthree miles, when I was awakened from my reverie by a body of people, whocame running up, and stopped the asses, giving me to understand that Imust go with them to Peckaba, to present myself to the king of Walli, orpay customs to them.  I endeavoured to make them comprehend that theobject of my journey not being traffic, I ought not to be subjected to atax like the slatees, and other merchants, who travel for gain; but Ireasoned to no purpose.  They said it was usual for travellers of alldescriptions to make a present to the king of Walli, and without doing soI could not be permitted to proceed.  As they were more numerous than myattendants, and withal very noisy, I thought it prudent to comply withtheir demand; and having presented them with four bars of tobacco, forthe king’s use, I was permitted to continue my journey, and at sunsetreached a village near Kootacunda, where we rested for the night.</p><p> </p><p> In the morning of December 4th I passed Kootacunda, the last town ofWalli, and stopped about an hour at a small adjoining village to paycustoms to an officer of the king of Woolli; we rested the ensuing nightat a village called Tabajang; and at noon the next day (December 5th) wereached Medina, the capital of the king of Woolli’s dominions.</p><p> </p><p> The kingdom of Woolli is bounded by Walli on the west, by the Gambia onthe south, by the small river Walli on the north-west, by Bondou on thenorth-east, and on the east by the Simbani wilderness.</p><p> </p><p> The inhabitants are Mandingoes, and, like most of the Mandingo nations,are divided into two great sects—the Mohammedans, who are called_bushreens_, and the pagans, who are called indiscriminately _kafirs_(unbelievers) and _sonakies_ (_i.e._, men who drink strong liquors).  Thepagan natives are by far the most numerous, and the government of thecountry is in their hands; for though the most respectable among thebushreens are frequently consulted in affairs of importance, yet they arenever permitted to take any share in the executive government, whichrests solely in the hands of the _mansa_, or sovereign, and greatofficers of the state.  Of these, the first in point of rank is thepresumptive heir of the crown, who is called the _farbanna_.  Next to himare the _alkaids_, or provincial governors, who are more frequentlycalled _keamos_.  Then follow the two grand divisions of free-men andslaves; of the former, the slatees, so frequently mentioned in thepreceding pages, are considered as the principal; but, in all classes,great respect is paid to the authority of aged men.</p><p> </p><p> On the death of the reigning monarch, his eldest son (if he has attainedthe age of manhood) succeeds to the regal authority.  If there is no son,or if the son is under the age of discretion, a meeting of the great menis held, and the late monarch’s nearest relation (commonly his brother)is called to the government, not as regent, or guardian to the infantson, but in full right, and to the exclusion of the minor.  The chargesof the government are defrayed by occasional tributes from the people,and by duties on goods transported across the country.  Travellers, ongoing from the Gambia towards the interior, pay customs in Europeanmerchandise.  On returning, they pay in iron and _shea-toulou_.  Thesetaxes are paid at every town.</p><p> </p><p> Medina, the capital of the kingdom, at which I was now arrived, is aplace of considerable extent, and may contain from eight hundred to onethousand houses.  It is fortified in the common African manner, by asurrounding high wall built of clay, and an outward fence of pointedstakes and prickly bushes; but the walls are neglected, and the outwardfence has suffered considerably from the active hands of busy housewives,who pluck up the stakes for firewood.  I obtained a lodging at one of theking’s near relations, who apprised me that at my introduction to theking I must not presume to _shake hands with him_.  “It was not usual,”he said, “to allow this liberty to strangers.”  Thus instructed, I wentin the afternoon to pay my respects to the sovereign, and ask permissionto pass through his territories to Bondou.  The king’s name was Jatta.He was the same venerable old man of whom so favourable an account wastransmitted by Major Houghton.  I found him seated upon a mat before thedoor of his hut; a number of men and women were arranged on each side,who were singing and clapping their hands.  I saluted him respectfully,and informed him of the purport of my visit.  The king graciouslyreplied, that he not only gave me leave to pass through his country, butwould offer up his prayers for my safety.  On this, one of my attendants,seemingly in return for the king’s condescension, began to sing, orrather to roar an Arabic song, at every pause of which the king himself,and all the people present, struck their hands against their foreheads,and exclaimed, with devout and affecting solemnity, “_Amen_, _amen_!”The king told me, furthermore, that I should have a guide the dayfollowing, who would conduct me safely to the frontier of his kingdom—Ithen took my leave, and in the evening sent the king an order upon Dr.Laidley for three gallons of rum, and received in return great store ofprovisions.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 6.—Early in the morning I went to the king a second time, tolearn if the guide was ready.  I found his Majesty seated upon abullock’s hide, warming himself before a large fire, for the Africans aresensible of the smallest variation in the temperature of the air, andfrequently complain of cold when a European is oppressed with heat.  Hereceived me with a benevolent countenance, and tenderly entreated me todesist from my purpose of travelling into the interior, telling me thatMajor Houghton had been killed in his route, and that if I followed hisfootsteps I should probably meet with his fate.  He said that I must notjudge of the people of the eastern country by those of Woolli: that thelatter were acquainted with white men, and respected them, whereas thepeople of the east had never seen a white man, and would certainlydestroy me.  I thanked the king for his affectionate solicitude, but toldhim that I had considered the matter, and was determined, notwithstandingall dangers, to proceed.  The king shook his head, but desisted fromfurther persuasion, and told me the guide should be ready in theafternoon.</p><p> </p><p> About two o’clock, the guide appearing, I went and took my last farewellof the good old king, and in three hours reached Konjour, a smallvillage, where we determined to rest for the night.  Here I purchased afine sheep for some beads, and my Serawoolli attendants killed it withall the ceremonies prescribed by their religion.  Part of it was dressedfor supper, after which a dispute arose between one of the Serawoollinegroes, and Johnson, my interpreter, about the sheep’s horns.  Theformer claimed the horns as his perquisite, for having acted the part ofour butcher, and Johnson contested the claim.  I settled the matter bygiving a horn to each of them.  This trifling incident is mentioned asintroductory to what follows, for it appeared on inquiry that these hornswere highly valued, as being easily convertible into portable sheaths, orcases, for containing and keeping secure certain charms or amulets called_saphies_, which the negroes constantly wear about them.  These saphiesare prayers, or rather sentences, from the Koran, which the Mohammedanpriests write on scraps of paper, and sell to the simple natives, whoconsider them to possess very extraordinary virtues.  Some of the negroeswear them to guard themselves against the bite of snakes or alligators;and on this occasion the saphie is commonly enclosed in a snake’s oralligator’s skin, and tied round the ankle.  Others have recourse to themin time of war, to protect their persons against hostile weapons; but thecommon use to which these amulets are applied is to prevent or curebodily diseases—to preserve from hunger and thirst—and generally toconciliate the favour of superior powers, under all the circumstances andoccurrences of life. {41}</p><p> </p><p> In this case it is impossible not to admire the wonderful contagion ofsuperstition, for, notwithstanding that the majority of the negroes arepagans, and absolutely reject the doctrines of Mohammed, I did not meetwith a man, whether a bushreen or kafir, who was not fully persuaded ofthe powerful efficacy of these amulets.  The truth is, that all thenatives of this part of Africa consider the art of writing as borderingon magic; and it is not in the doctrines of the prophet, but in the artsof the magician, that their confidence is placed.  It will hereafter beseen that I was myself lucky enough, in circumstances of distress, toturn the popular credulity in this respect to good account.</p><p> </p><p> On the 7th I departed from Konjour, and slept at a village called Malla(or Mallaing), and on the 8th about noon I arrived at Kolor, aconsiderable town, near the entrance into which I observed, hanging upona tree, a sort of masquerade habit, made of the bark of trees, which Iwas told, on inquiry, belonged to _Mumbo Jumbo_.  This is a strangebugbear, common to all the Mandingo towns, and much employed by the pagannatives in keeping their women in subjection; for as the kafirs are notrestricted in the number of their wives, every one marries as many as hecan conveniently maintain—and as it frequently happens that the ladiesdisagree among themselves, family quarrels sometimes rise to such aheight, that the authority of the husband can no longer preserve peace inhis household.  In such cases, the interposition of Mumbo Jumbo is calledin, and is always decisive.</p><p> </p><p> This strange minister of justice (who is supposed to be either thehusband himself, or some person instructed by him), disguised in thedress that has been mentioned, and armed with the rod of publicauthority, announces his coming (whenever his services are required) byloud and dismal screams in the woods near the town.  He begins thepantomime at the approach of night; and as soon as it is dark he entersthe town, and proceeds to the bentang, at which all the inhabitantsimmediately assemble.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 9.—As there was no water to be procured on the road, wetravelled with great expedition until we reached Tambacunda; anddeparting from thence early the next morning, the 10th, we reached in theevening Kooniakary, a town of nearly the same magnitude as Kolor.  Aboutnoon on the 11th we arrived at Koojar, the frontier town of Woolli,towards Bondou, from which it is separated by an intervening wildernessof two days’ journey.</p><p> </p><p> The guide appointed by the king of Woolli being now to return, Ipresented him with some amber for his trouble; and having been informedthat it was not possible at all times to procure water in the wilderness,I made inquiry for men who would serve both as guides and water-bearersduring my journey across it.  Three negroes, elephant-hunters, offeredtheir services for these purposes, which I accepted, and paid them threebars each in advance; and the day being far spent, I determined to passthe night in my present quarters.</p><p> </p><p> The inhabitants of Koojar, though not wholly unaccustomed to the sight ofEuropeans (most of them having occasionally visited the countries on theGambia), beheld me with a mixture of curiosity and reverence, and in theevening invited me to see a _neobering_, or wrestling-match, at thebentang.  This is an exhibition very common in all the Mandingocountries.  The spectators arranged themselves in a circle, leaving theintermediate space for the wrestlers, who were strong active young men,full of emulation, and accustomed, I suppose, from their infancy to thissort of exertion.  Being stripped of their clothing, except a short pairof drawers, and having their skin anointed with oil, or _shea_ butter,the combatants approached each other on all-fours, parrying with, andoccasionally extending a hand for some time, till at length one of themsprang forward, and caught his rival by the knee.  Great dexterity andjudgment were now displayed, but the contest was decided by superiorstrength; and I think that few Europeans would have been able to copewith the conqueror.  It must not be unobserved, that the combatants wereanimated by the music of a drum, by which their actions were in somemeasure regulated.</p><p> </p><p> The wrestling was succeeded by a dance, in which many performersassisted, all of whom were provided with little bells, which werefastened to their legs and arms; and here, too, the drum regulated theirmotions.  It was beaten with a crooked stick, which the drummer held inhis right hand, occasionally using his left to deaden the sound, and thusvary the music.  The drama is likewise applied on these occasions to keeporder among the spectators, by imitating the sound of certain Mandingosentences.  For example, when the wrestling-match is about to begin, thedrummer strikes what is understood to signify _ali bæ see_ (sit alldown), upon which the spectators immediately seat themselves; and whenthe combatants are to begin, he strikes _amuta_! _amuta_! (take hold!take hold!)</p><p> </p><p> In the course of the evening I was presented, by way of refreshment, witha liquor, which tasted so much like the strong beer of my native country(and very good beer too), as to induce me to inquire into itscomposition; and I learnt, with some degree of surprise, that it wasactually made from corn which had been previously malted, much in thesame manner as barley is malted in Great Britain.  A root yielding agrateful bitter was used in lieu of hops, the name of which I haveforgotten; but the corn which yields the wort is the _holcus spicatus_ ofbotanists.</p><p> </p><p> Early in the morning (the 12th) I found that one of the elephant-huntershad absconded with the money he had received from me in part of wages;and in order to prevent the other two from following his example, I madethem instantly fill their calabashes (or gourds) with water; and as thesun rose, I entered the wilderness that separates the kingdoms of Woolliand Bondou.</p><p> </p><p> We continued our journey without stopping any more until noon, when wecame to a large tree, called by the natives _neema taba_.  It had a verysingular appearance, being decorated with innumerable rags or scraps ofcloth, which persons travelling across the wilderness had at differenttimes tied to the branches, probably at first to inform the travellerthat water was to be found near it; but the custom has been so greatlysanctioned by time, that nobody now presumes to pass without hanging upsomething.  I followed the example, and suspended a handsome piece ofcloth on one of the boughs; and being told that either a well, or pool ofwater, was at no great distance, I ordered the negroes to unload theasses, that we might give them corn, and regale ourselves with theprovisions we had brought.  In the meantime, I sent one of theelephant-hunters to look for the well, intending, if water was to beobtained, to rest here for the night.  A pool was found, but the waterwas thick and muddy, and the negro discovered near it the remains of afire recently extinguished, and the fragments of provisions, whichafforded a proof that it had been lately visited, either by travellers orbanditti.  The fears of my attendants supposed the latter; and believingthat robbers lurked near as, I was persuaded to change my resolution ofresting here all night, and proceed to another watering-place, which Iwas assured we might reach early in the evening.</p><p> </p><p> We departed accordingly, but it was eight o’clock at night before we cameto the watering-place; and being now sufficiently fatigued with so long aday’s journey, we kindled a large fire and lay down, surrounded by ourcattle, on the bare ground, more than a gunshot from any bush, thenegroes agreeing to keep watch by turns to prevent surprise.</p><p> </p><p> I know not, indeed, that any danger was justly to be dreaded, but thenegroes were unaccountably apprehensive of banditti during the whole ofthe journey.  As soon, therefore, as daylight appeared, we filled our_soofroos_ (skins) and calabashes at the pool, and set out for Tallika,the first town in Bondou, which we reached about eleven o’clock in theforenoon (the 13th of December).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER IV.FROM TALLIKA TO KAJAAGA.</p><p> </p><p> TALLIKA, the frontier town of Bondou towards Woolli, is inhabited chieflyby Foulahs of the Mohammedan religion, who live in considerableaffluence, partly by furnishing provisions to the coffles, or caravans,that pass through the town, and partly by the sale of ivory, obtained byhunting elephants, in which employment the young men are generally verysuccessful.  Here an officer belonging to the king of Bondou constantlyresides, whose business it is to give timely information of the arrivalof the caravans, which are taxed according to the number of loaded assesthat arrive at Tallika.</p><p> </p><p> I took up my residence at this officer’s house, and agreed with him toaccompany me to Fatteconda, the residence of the king, for which he wasto receive five bars; and before my departure I wrote a few lines to Dr.Laidley, and gave my letter to the master of a caravan bound for theGambia.  This caravan consisted of nine or ten people, with five assesloaded with ivory.  The large teeth are conveyed in nets, two on eachside of the ass; the small ones are wrapped up in skins, and secured withropes.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 14.—We left Tallika, and rode on very peaceably for about twomiles, when a violent quarrel arose between two of my fellow-travellers,one of whom was the blacksmith, in the course of which they bestowed someopprobrious terms upon each other; and it is worthy of remark, that anAfrican will sooner forgive a blow than a term of reproach applied to hisancestors.  “Strike me, but do not curse my mother,” is a commonexpression even among the slaves.  This sort of abuse, therefore, soenraged one of the disputants, that he drew his cutlass upon theblacksmith, and would certainly have ended the dispute in a very seriousmanner, if the others had not laid hold of him and wrested the cutlassfrom him.  I was obliged to interfere, and put an end to thisdisagreeable business by desiring the blacksmith to be silent, andtelling the other, who I thought was in the wrong, that if he attemptedin future to draw his cutlass, or molest any of my attendants, I shouldlook upon him as a robber, and shoot him without further ceremony.  Thisthreat had the desired effect, and we marched sullenly along till theafternoon, when we arrived at a number of small villages scattered overan open and fertile plain.  At one of these, called Ganado, we took upour residence for the night; here an exchange of presents and a goodsupper terminated all animosities among my attendants, and the night wasfar advanced before any of us thought of going to sleep.  We were amusedby an itinerant _singing man_, who told a number of diverting stories,and played some sweet airs by blowing his breath upon a bow-string, andstriking it at the same time with a stick.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 15.—At daybreak my fellow-travellers, the Serawoollies, tookleave of me, with many prayers for my safety.  About a mile from Ganadowe crossed a considerable branch of the Gambia, called Neriko.  The bankswere steep and covered with mimosas; and I observed in the mud a numberof large mussels, but the natives do not eat them.  About noon, the sunbeing exceedingly hot, we rested two hours in the shade of a tree, andpurchased some milk and pounded corn from some Foulah herdsmen, and atsunset reached a town called Koorkarany, where the blacksmith had somerelations; and here we rested two days.</p><p> </p><p> Koorkarany is a Mohammedan town surrounded by a high wall, and isprovided with a mosque.  Here I was shown a number of Arabic manuscripts,particularly a copy of the book before mentioned, called _Al Sharra_.The _maraboo_, or priest, in whose possession it was, read and explainedto me in Mandingo many of the most remarkable passages, and, in return, Ishowed him Richardson’s Arabic Grammar, which he very much admired.</p><p> </p><p> On the evening of the second day (December 17) we departed fromKoorkarany.  We were joined by a young man who was travelling toFatteconda for salt; and as night set in we reached Dooggi, a smallvillage about three miles from Koorkarany.</p><p> </p><p> Provisions were here so cheap that I purchased a bullock for six smallstones of amber; for I found my company increase or diminish according tothe good fare they met with.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 18.—Early in the morning we departed from Dooggi, and, beingjoined by a number of Foulahs and other people, made a formidableappearance, and were under no apprehension of being plundered in thewoods.  About eleven o’clock, one of the asses proving very refractory,the negroes took a curious method to make him tractable.  They cut aforked stick, and putting the forked part into the ass’s mouth, like thebit of a bridle, tied the two smaller parts together above his head,leaving the lower part of the stick of sufficient length to strikeagainst the ground, if the ass should attempt to put his head down.After this the ass walked along quietly and gravely enough, taking care,after some practice, to hold his head sufficiently high to prevent stonesor roots of trees from striking against the end of the stick, whichexperience had taught him would give a severe shock to his teeth.  Thiscontrivance produced a ludicrous appearance, but my fellow-travellerstold me it was constantly adopted by the slatees, and always provedeffectual.</p><p> </p><p> In the evening we arrived at a few scattered villages, surrounded withextensive cultivation, at one of which, called Buggil, we passed thenight in a miserable hut, having no other bed than a bundle ofcorn-stalks, and no provisions but what we brought with us.  The wellshere are dug with great ingenuity, and are very deep.  I measured one ofthe bucket-ropes, and found the depth of the well to be twenty-eightfathoms.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 19.—We departed from Buggil, and travelled along a dry, stonyheight, covered with mimosas, till mid-day, when the land sloped towardsthe east, and we descended into a deep valley, in which I observedabundance of whinstone and white quartz.  Pursuing our course to theeastward, along this valley in the bed of an exhausted river-course, wecame to a large village, where we intended to lodge.  We found many ofthe natives dressed in a thin French gauze, which they called _byqui_;this being a light airy dress, and well calculated to display the shapeof their persons, is much esteemed by the ladies.  The manners of thesefemales, however, did not correspond with their dress, for they were rudeand troublesome in the highest degree; they surrounded me in numbers,begging for amber, beads, &c., and were so vehement in theirsolicitations, that I found it impossible to resist them.  They tore mycloak, cut the buttons from my boy’s clothes, and were proceeding toother outrages, when I mounted my horse and rode off, followed forhalf-a-mile by a body of these harpies.</p><p> </p><p> In the evening we reached Soobrudooka, and as my company was numerous(being fourteen), I purchased a sheep and abundance of corn for supper;after which we lay down by the bundles, and passed an uncomfortable nightin a heavy dew.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 20.—We departed from Soobrudooka, and at two o’clock reached alarge village situated on the banks of the Falemé river, which is hererapid and rocky.  The natives were employed in fishing in various ways.The large fish were taken in long baskets made of split cane, and placedin a strong current, which was created by walls of stone built across thestream, certain open places being left, through which the water rushedwith great force.  Some of these baskets were more than twenty feet long,and when once the fish had entered one of them, the force of the streamprevented it from returning.  The small fish were taken in great numbersin hand-nets, which the natives weave of cotton, and use with greatdexterity.  The fish last mentioned are about the size of sprats, and areprepared for sale in different ways; the most common is by pounding thementire as they come from the stream, in a wooden mortar, and exposingthem to dry in the sun, in large lumps like sugar loaves.  It may besupposed that the smell is not very agreeable; but in the Moorishcountries to the north of the Senegal, where fish is scarcely known, thispreparation is esteemed as a luxury, and sold to considerable advantage.The manner of using it by the natives is by dissolving a piece of thisblack loaf in boiling water, and mixing it with their kouskous.</p><p> </p><p> On returning to the village, after an excursion to the river-side toinspect the fishery, an old Moorish shereef came to bestow his blessingupon me, and beg some paper to write saphies upon.  This man had seenMajor Houghton in the kingdom of Kaarta, and told me that he died in thecountry of the Moors.</p><p> </p><p> About three in the afternoon we continued our course along the bank ofthe river to the northward, till eight o’clock, when we reached Nayemow.Here the hospitable master of the town received us kindly, and presentedus with a bullock.  In return I gave him some amber and beads.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 21.—In the morning, having agreed for a canoe to carry over mybundles, I crossed the river, which came up to my knees as I sat on myhorse; but the water is so clear, that from the high bank the bottom isvisible all the way over.</p><p> </p><p> About noon we entered Fatteconda, the capital of Bondou, and in a littletime received an invitation to the house of a respectable slatee: for asthere are no public-houses in Africa, it is customary for strangers tostand at the bentang, or some other place of public resort, till they areinvited to a lodging by some of the inhabitants.  We accepted the offer;and in an hour afterwards a person came and told me that he was sent onpurpose to conduct me to the king, who was very desirous of seeing meimmediately, if I was not too much fatigued.</p><p> </p><p> I took my interpreter with me, and followed the messenger till we gotquite out of the town, and crossed some corn-fields; when, suspectingsome trick, I stopped, and asked the guide whither he was going.  Uponwhich, he pointed to a man sitting under a tree at some little distance,and told me that the king frequently gave audience in that retiredmanner, in order to avoid a crowd of people, and that nobody but myselfand my interpreter must approach him.  When I advanced the king desiredme to come and sit by him upon the mat; and, after hearing my story, onwhich be made no observation, he asked if I wished to purchase any slavesor gold.  Being answered in the negative, he seemed rather surprised, butdesired me to come to him in the evening, and he would give me someprovisions.</p><p> </p><p> This monarch was called Almami, a Moorish name, though I was told that hewas not a Mohammedan, but a kafir or pagan.  I had heard that he hadacted towards Major Houghton with great unkindness, and caused him to beplundered.  His behaviour, therefore, towards myself at this interview,though much more civil than I expected, was far from freeing me fromuneasiness.  I still apprehended some double-dealing; and as I was nowentirely in his power, I thought it best to smooth the way by a present.Accordingly, I took with me in the evening one canister of gunpowder,some amber, tobacco, and my umbrella; and as I considered that my bundleswould inevitably be searched, I concealed some few articles in the roofof the hut where I lodged, and I put on my new blue coat in order topreserve it.</p><p> </p><p> All the houses belonging to the king and his family are surrounded by alofty mud wall, which converts the whole into a kind of citadel.  Theinterior is subdivided into different courts.  At the first place ofentrance I observed a man standing with a musket on his shoulder; and Ifound the way to the presence very intricate, leading through manypassages, with sentinels placed at the different doors.  When we came tothe entrance of the court in which the king resides, both my guide andinterpreter, according to custom, took off their sandals; and the formerpronounced the king’s name aloud, repeating it till he was answered fromwithin.  We found the monarch sitting upon a mat, and two attendants withhim.  I repeated what I had before told him concerning the object of myjourney, and my reasons for passing through his country.  He seemed,however, but half satisfied.  When I offered to show him the contents ofmy portmanteau, and everything belonging to me, he was convinced; and itwas evident that his suspicion had arisen from a belief that every whiteman must of necessity be a trader.  When I had delivered my presents, heseemed well pleased, and was particularly delighted with the umbrella,which he repeatedly furled and unfurled, to the great admiration ofhimself and his two attendants, who could not for some time comprehendthe use of this wonderful machine.  After this I was about to take myleave, when the king, desiring me to stop a while, began a long preamblein favour of the whites, extolling their immense wealth and gooddispositions.  He next proceeded to an eulogium on my blue coat, of whichthe yellow buttons seemed particularly to catch his fancy; and heconcluded by entreating me to present him with it, assuring me, for myconsolation under the loss of it, that he would wear it on all publicoccasions, and inform every one who saw it of my great liberality towardshim.  The request of an African prince, in his own dominions,particularly when made to a stranger, comes little short of a command.It is only a way of obtaining by gentle means what he can, if he pleases,take by force; and as it was against my interest to offend him by arefusal, I very quietly took off my coat, the only good one in mypossession, and laid it at his feet.</p><p> </p><p> In return for my compliance, he presented me with great plenty ofprovisions, and desired to see me again in the morning.  I accordinglyattended, and found in sitting upon his bed.  He told me he was sick, andwished to have a little blood taken from him; but I had no sooner, tiedup his arm and displayed the lancet, than his courage failed, and hebegged me to postpone the operation till the afternoon, as he felthimself, he said, much better than he had been, and thanked me kindly formy readiness to serve him.  He then observed that his women were verydesirous to see me, and requested that I would favour them with a visit.An attendant was ordered to conduct me; and I had no sooner entered thecourt appropriated to the ladies, than the whole seraglio surroundedme—some begging for physic, some for amber, and all of them desirous oftrying that great African specific, _blood-letting_.  They were ten ortwelve in number, most of them young and handsome, and wearing on theirheads ornaments of gold, and beads of amber.</p><p> </p><p> They rallied me with a good deal of gaiety on different subjects,particularly upon the whiteness of my skin and the prominency of my nose.They insisted that both were artificial.  The first, they said, wasproduced when I was an infant, by dipping me in milk; and they insistedthat my nose had been pinched every day, till it had acquired its presentunsightly and unnatural conformation.  On my part, without disputing myown deformity, I paid them many compliments on African beauty.  I praisedthe glossy jet of their skins, and the lovely depression of their noses;but they said that flattery, or, as they emphatically termed it,_honey-mouth_, was not esteemed in Bondou.  In return, however, for mycompany or my compliments (to which, by the way, they seemed not soinsensible as they affected to be) they presented me with a jar of honeyand some fish, which were sent to my lodging; and I was desired to comeagain to the king a little before sunset.</p><p> </p><p> I carried with me some beads and writing-paper, it being usual to presentsome small offering on taking leave, in return for which the king gave mefive drachms of gold, observing that it was but a trifle, and given outof pure friendship, but would be of use to me in travelling, for thepurchase of provisions.  He seconded this act of kindness by one stillgreater, politely telling me that, though it was customary to examine thebaggage of every traveller passing through his country, yet, in thepresent instance, he would dispense without ceremony, adding, I was atliberty to depart when I pleased.</p><p> </p><p> Accordingly, on the morning of the 23rd, we left Fatteconda, and abouteleven o’clock came to a small village, where we determined to stop forthe rest of the day.</p><p> </p><p> In the afternoon my fellow-travellers informed me that, as this was theboundary between Bondou and Kajaaga, and dangerous for travellers, itwould be necessary to continue our journey by night, until we shouldreach a more hospitable part of the country.  I agreed to the proposal,and hired two people for guides through the woods; and as soon as thepeople of the village were gone to sleep (the moon shining bright) we setout.  The stillness of the air, the howling of the wild beasts, and thedeep solitude of the forest, made the scene solemn and oppressive.  Not aword was uttered by any of us but in a whisper; all were attentive, andevery one anxious to show his sagacity by pointing out to me the wolvesand hyænas, as they glided like shadows from one thicket to another.Towards morning we arrived at a village called Kimmoo, where our guidesawakened one of their acquaintances, and we stopped to give the assessome corn, and roast a few ground-nuts for ourselves.  At daylight weresumed our journey, and in the afternoon arrived at Joag, in the kingdomof Kajaaga.</p><p> </p><p> Being now in a country and among a people differing in many respects fromthose that have as yet fallen under our observation, I shall, before Iproceed further, give some account of Bondou (the territory we have left)and its inhabitants, the Foulahs, the description of whom I purposelyreserved for this part of my work.</p><p> </p><p> Bondou is bounded on the east by Bambouk, on the south-east and south byTenda and the Simbani wilderness, on the south-west by Woolli, on thewest by Foota Torra, and on the north by Kajaaga.</p><p> </p><p> The country, like that of Woolli, is very generally covered with woods,but the land is more elevated, and, towards the Falemé river, rises intoconsiderable hills.  In native fertility the soil is not surpassed, Ibelieve, by any part of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> From the central situation of Bondou, between the Gambia and Senegalrivers, it is become a place of great resort, both for the slatees, whogenerally pass through it on going from the coast to the interiorcountries, and for occasional traders, who frequently come hither fromthe inland countries to purchase salt.</p><p> </p><p> These different branches of commerce are conducted principally byMandingoes and Serawoollies, who have settled in the country.  Thesemerchants likewise carry on a considerable trade with Gedumah and otherMoorish countries, bartering corn and blue cotton cloths for salt, whichthey again barter in Dentila and other districts for iron, shea-butter,and small quantities of gold-dust.  They likewise sell a variety ofsweet-smelling gums, packed up in small bags, containing each about apound.  These gums, being thrown on hot embers, produce a very pleasantodour, and are used by the Mandingoes for perfuming their huts andclothes.</p><p> </p><p> The customs, or duties on travellers, are very heavy; in almost everytown an ass-load pays a bar of European merchandise, and at Fatteconda,the residence of the king, one Indian baft, or a musket, and six bottlesof gunpowder, are exacted as the common tribute.  By means of theseduties, the king of Bondou is well supplied with arms and ammunition—acircumstance which makes him formidable to the neighbouring states.</p><p> </p><p> The inhabitants differ in their complexions and national manners from theMandingoes and Serawoollies, with whom they are frequently at war.  Someyears ago the king of Bondou crossed the Falemé river with a numerousarmy; and, after a short and bloody campaign, totally defeated the forcesof Samboo, king of Bambouk, who was obliged to sue for peace, andsurrender to him all the towns along the eastern bank of the Falemé.</p><p> </p><p> The Foulahs in general (as has been observed in a former chapter) are ofa tawny complexion, with small features and soft silky hair; next to theMandingoes, they are undoubtedly the most considerable of all the nationsin this part of Africa.  Their original country is said to be Fooladoo(which signifies the country of the Foulahs); but they possess at presentmany other kingdoms at a great distance from each other; theircomplexion, however, is not exactly the same in the different districts;in Bondou, and the other kingdoms which are situated in the vicinity ofthe Moorish territories, they are of a more yellow complexion than in thesouthern states.</p><p> </p><p> The Foulahs of Bondou are naturally of a mild and gentle disposition, butthe uncharitable maxims of the Koran have made them less hospitable tostrangers, and more reserved in their behaviour, than the Mandingoes.They evidently consider all the negro natives as their inferiors; and,when talking of different nations, always rank themselves among the whitepeople.</p><p> </p><p> Their government differs from that of the Mandingoes chiefly in this,that they are more immediately under the influence of Mohammedan laws;for all the chief men, the king excepted, and a large majority of theinhabitants of Bondou, are Mussulmans, and the authority and laws of theProphet are everywhere looked upon as sacred and decisive.  In theexercise of their faith, however, they are not very intolerant towardssuch of their countrymen as still retain their ancient superstitions.Religious persecution is not known among them, nor is it necessary; forthe system of Mohammed is made to extend itself by means abundantly moreefficacious.  By establishing small schools in the different towns, wheremany of the pagan as well as Mohammedan children are taught to read theKoran, and instructed in the tenets of the Prophet, the Mohammedanpriests fix a bias on the minds, and form the character, of their youngdisciples, which no accidents of life can ever afterwards remove oralter.  Many of these little schools I visited in my progress through thecountry, and I observed with pleasure the great docility and submissivedeportment of the children, and heartily wished they had had betterinstructors and a purer religion.</p><p> </p><p> With the Mohammedan faith is also introduced the Arabic language, withwhich most of the Foulahs have a slight acquaintance.  Their nativetongue abounds very much in liquids, but there is something unpleasant inthe manner of pronouncing it.  A stranger, on hearing the commonconversation of two Foulahs, would imagine that they were scolding eachother.  Their numerals are these:—</p><p> </p><p> One        Go.Two        Deeddee.Three      Tettee.Four       Nee.Five       Jouee.Six        Jego.Seven      Jedeeddee.Eight      Je Tettee.Nine       Je Nee.Ten        Sappo.</p><p> </p><p> The industry of the Foulahs, in the occupations of pasturage andagriculture, is everywhere remarkable.  Even on the banks of the Gambia,the greater part of the corn is raised by them, and their herds andflocks are more numerous and in better condition than those of theMandingoes; but in Bondou they are opulent in a high degree, and enjoyall the necessaries of life in the greatest profusion.  They displaygreat skill in the management of their cattle, making them extremelygentle by kindness and familiarity.  On the approach of the night, theyare collected from the woods and secured in folds called _korrees_, whichare constructed in the neighbourhood of the different villages.  In themiddle of each korree is erected a small hut, wherein one or two of theherdsmen keep watch during the night, to prevent the cattle from beingstolen, and to keep up the fires which are kindled round the korree tofrighten away the wild beasts.</p><p> </p><p> The cattle are milked in the mornings and evenings: the milk isexcellent; but the quantity obtained from any one cow is by no means sogreat as in Europe.  The Foulahs use the milk chiefly as an article ofdiet, and that not until it is quite sour.  The cream which it affords isvery thick, and is converted into butter by stirring it violently in alarge calabash.  This butter, when melted over a gentle fire, and freedfrom impurities, is preserved in small earthen pots, and forms a part inmost of their dishes; it serves likewise to anoint their heads, and isbestowed very liberally on their faces and arms.</p><p> </p><p> But although milk is plentiful, it is somewhat remarkable that theFoulahs, and indeed all the inhabitants of this part of Africa, aretotally unacquainted with the art of making cheese.  A firm attachment tothe customs of their ancestors makes them view with an eye of prejudiceeverything that looks like innovation.  The heat of the climate and thegreat scarcity of salt are held forth as unanswerable objections; and thewhole process appears to them too long and troublesome to be attendedwith any solid advantage.</p><p> </p><p> Besides the cattle, which constitute the chief wealth of the Foulahs,they possess some excellent horses, the breed of which seems to be amixture of the Arabian with the original African.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER V.FROM KAJAAGA TO KASSON.</p><p> </p><p> THE kingdom of Kajaaga, in which I was now arrived, is called by theFrench Gallam, but the name that I have adopted is universally used bythe natives.  This country is bounded on the south-east and south byBambouk, on the west by Bondou and Foota-Torra, and on the north by theriver Senegal.</p><p> </p><p> The air and climate are, I believe, more pure and salubrious than at anyof the settlements towards the coast; the face of the country iseverywhere interspersed with a pleasing variety of hills and valleys; andthe windings of the Senegal river, which descends from the rocky hills ofthe interior, make the scenery on its banks very picturesque andbeautiful.</p><p> </p><p> The inhabitants are called Serawoollies, or (as the French write it)_Seracolets_.  Their complexion is a jet black: they are not to bedistinguished in this respect from the Jaloffs.</p><p> </p><p> The government is monarchical, and the regal authority, from what Iexperienced of it, seems to be sufficiently formidable.  The peoplethemselves, however, complain of no oppression, and seemed all veryanxious to support the king in a contest he was going to enter into withthe sovereign of Kasson.  The Serawoollies are habitually a tradingpeople; they formerly carried on a great commerce with the French in goldand slaves, and still maintain some traffic in slaves with the Britishfactories on the Gambia.  They are reckoned tolerably fair and just intheir dealings, but are indefatigable in their exertions to acquirewealth, and they derive considerable profits by the sale of salt andcotton cloth in distant countries.  When a Serawoolli merchant returnshome from a trading expedition the neighbours immediately assemble tocongratulate him upon his arrival.  On these occasions the travellerdisplays his wealth and liberality by making a few presents to hisfriends; but if he has been unsuccessful his levee is soon over, andevery one looks upon him as a man of no understanding, who could performa long journey, and (at they express it) “bring back nothing but the hairupon his head.”</p><p> </p><p> Their language abounds much in gutturals, and is not so harmonious asthat spoken by the Foulahs.  It is, however, well worth acquiring bythose who travel through this part of the African continent, it beingvery generally understood in the kingdoms of Kasson, Kaarta, Ludamar, andthe northern parts of Bambarra.  In all these countries the Serawoolliesare the chief traders.  Their numerals are:—</p><p> </p><p> One         Bani.Two         Fillo.Three       Sicco.Four        Narrato.Five        Karrago.Six         Toomo.Seven       Nero.Eight       Sego.Nine        Kabbo.Ten         Tamo.Twenty      Tamo di Fillo.</p><p> </p><p> We arrived at Joag, the frontier town of this kingdom, on the 24th ofDecember, and took up our residence at the house of the chief man, who ishere no longer known by the title of alkaid, but is called the _dooty_.He was a rigid Mohammedan, but distinguished for his hospitality.  Thistown may be supposed, on a gross computation, to contain two thousandinhabitants.  It is surrounded by a high wall, in which are a number ofport-holes, for musketry to fire through, in case of an attack.  Everyman’s possession is likewise surrounded by a wall, the whole forming somany distinct citadels; and amongst a people unacquainted with the use ofartillery these walls answer all the purposes of stronger fortifications.To the westward of the town is a small river, on the banks of which thenatives raise great plenty of tobacco and onions.</p><p> </p><p> The same evening Madiboo, the bushreen, who had accompanied me fromPisania, went to pay a visit to his father and mother, who dwelt at aneighbouring town called Dramanet.  He was joined by my other attendant,the blacksmith.  As soon as it was dark I was invited to see the sportsof the inhabitants, it being their custom, on the arrival of strangers,to welcome them by diversions of different kinds.  I found a great crowdsurrounding a party who were dancing, by the light of some large fires,to the music of four drums, which were beat with great exactness anduniformity.  The dances, however, consisted more in wanton gestures thanin muscular exertion or graceful attitudes.  The ladies vied with eachother in displaying the most voluptuous movements imaginable.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 25.—About two o’clock in the morning a number of horsemen cameinto the town, and, having awakened my landlord, talked to him for sometime in the Serawoolli tongue; after which they dismounted and came tothe bentang, on which I had made my bed.  One of them, thinking that Iwas asleep, attempted to steal the musket that lay by me on the mat, butfinding that he could not effect his purpose undiscovered, he desisted,and the strangers sat down by me till daylight.</p><p> </p><p> I could now easily perceive, by the countenance of my interpreter,Johnson, that something very unpleasant was in agitation.  I was likewisesurprised to see Madiboo and the blacksmith so soon returned.  Oninquiring the reason, Madiboo informed me that, as they were dancing atDramanet, ten horsemen belonging to Batcheri, king of the country, withhis second son at their head, had arrived there, inquiring if the whiteman had passed, and, on being told that I was at Joag, they rode offwithout stopping.  Madiboo added that on hearing this he and theblacksmith hastened back to give me notice of their coming.  Whilst I waslistening to this narrative the ten horsemen mentioned by Madibooarrived, and coming to the bentang, dismounted and seated themselves withthose who had come before—the whole being about twenty in number—forminga circle round me, and each man holding his musket in his hand.  I tookthis opportunity to observe to my landlord that, as I did not understandthe Serawoolli tongue, I hoped whatever the men had to say they wouldspeak in Mandingo.  To this they agreed; and a short man, loaded with aremarkable number of saphies, opened the business in a very longharangue, informing me that I had entered the king’s town without havingfirst paid the duties, or giving any present to the king; and that,according to the laws of the country, my people, cattle, and baggage wereforfeited.  He added that they had received orders from the king toconduct me to Maana, {70} the place of his residence, and if I refused tocome with them their orders were to bring me by force; upon his sayingwhich all of them rose up and asked me if I was ready.  It would havebeen equally vain and imprudent in me to have resisted or irritated sucha body of men; I therefore affected to comply with their commands, andbegged them only to stop a little until I had given my horse a feed ofcorn, and settled matters with my landlord.  The poor blacksmith, who wasa native of Kasson, mistook this feigned compliance for a real intention,and taking me away from the company, told me that he had always behavedtowards me as if I had been his father and master, and he hoped I wouldnot entirely ruin him by going to Maana, adding that as there was everyreason to believe a war would soon take place between Kasson and Kajaaga,he should not only lose his little property, the savings of four years’industry, but should certainly be detained and sold as a slave, unlesshis friends had an opportunity of paying two slaves for his redemption.I saw this reasoning in its full force, and determined to do my utmost topreserve the blacksmith from so dreadful a fate.  I therefore told theking’s son that I was ready to go with him, upon condition that, theblacksmith, who was an inhabitant of a distant kingdom, and entirelyunconnected with me, should be allowed to stay at Joag till my return.To this they all objected, and insisted that, as we had all actedcontrary to the laws, we were all equally answerable for our conduct.</p><p> </p><p> I now took my landlord aside, and giving him a small present ofgunpowder, asked his advice in such critical a situation.  He wasdecidedly of opinion that I ought not to go to the king: he was fullyconvinced, he said, that if the king should discover anything valuable inmy possession, he would not be over scrupulous about the means ofobtaining it.</p><p> </p><p> Towards the evening, as I was sitting upon the bentang chewing straws, anold female slave, passing by with a basket upon her head, asked me _ifhad got my dinner_.  As I thought she only laughed at me, I gave her noanswer; but my boy, who was sitting close by, answered for me, and toldher that the king’s people had robbed me of all my money.  On hearingthis, the good old woman, with a look of unaffected benevolence,immediately took the basket from her head, and showing me that itcontained ground nuts, asked me if I could eat them.  Being answered inthe affirmative, she presented me with a few handfuls, and walked awaybefore I had time to thank her for this seasonable supply.</p><p> </p><p> The old woman had scarcely left me when I received information that anephew of Demba Sego Jalla, the Mandingo king of Kasson, was coming topay me a visit.  He had been sent on an embassy to Batcheri, King ofKajaaga, to endeavour to settle the disputes which had arisen between hisuncle and the latter; but after debating the matter four days withoutsuccess, he was now on his return, and hearing that a white man was atJoag, on his way to Kasson, curiosity brought in to see me.  Irepresented to him my situation and distresses, when he frankly offeredme his protection, and said he would be my guide to Kasson (provided Iwould set out the next morning), and be answerable for my safety.  Ireadily and gratefully accepted his offer, and was ready with myattendants by daylight on the morning of the 27th of December.</p><p> </p><p> My protector, whose name was Demba Sego, probably after his uncle, had anumerous retinue.  Our company, at leaving Joag, consisted of thirtypersons and six loaded asses; and we rode on cheerfully enough for somehours, without any remarkable occurrence until we came to a species oftree for which my interpreter Johnson had made frequent inquiry.  Onfinding it, he desired us to stop, and producing a white chicken, whichhe had purchased at Joag for the purpose, he tied it by the leg to one ofthe branches, and then told us we might now safely proceed, for that ourjourney would be prosperous.</p><p> </p><p> At noon we had reached Gungadi, a large town where we stopped about anhour, until some of the asses that had fallen behind came up.  Here Iobserved a number of date-trees, and a mosque built of clay, with sixturrets, on the pinnacles of which were placed six ostrich eggs.  Alittle before sunset we arrived at the town of Samee, on the banks of theSenegal, which is here a beautiful but shallow river, moving slowly overa bed of sand and gravel.  The banks are high, and covered withverdure—the country is open and cultivated—and the rocky hills of Fellowand Bambouk add much to the beauty of the landscape.</p><p> </p><p> _December_ 28.—We departed from Samee, and arrived in the afternoon atKayee, a large village, part of which is situated on the north and parton the south side of the river.</p><p> </p><p> The ferryman then taking hold of the most steady of the horses by a rope,led him into the water, and paddled the canoe a little from the brink;upon which a general attack commenced upon the other horses, who, findingthemselves pelted and kicked on all sides, unanimously plunged into theriver, and followed their companion.  A few boys swam in after them; and,by laving water upon them when they attempted to return, urged themonwards; and we had the satisfaction in about fifteen minutes to see themall safe on the other side.  It was a matter of greater difficulty tomanage the asses; their natural stubbornness of disposition made themendure a great deal of pelting and shoving before they would venture intothe water; and when they had reached the middle of the stream, four ofthem turned back, in spite of every exertion to get them forwards.  Twohours were spent in getting the whole of them over; an hour more wasemployed in transporting the baggage; and it was near sunset before thecanoe returned, when Demba Sego and myself embarked in this dangerouspassage-boat, which the least motion was like to overset.  The king’snephew thought this a proper time to have a peep into a tin box of minethat stood in the fore part of the canoe; and in stretching out his bandfor it, he unfortunately destroyed the equilibrium, and overset thecanoe.  Luckily we were not far advanced, and got back to the shorewithout much difficulty; from whence, after wringing the water from ourclothes, we took a fresh departure, and were soon afterwards safelylanded in Kasson.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER VI.TIGGITY SEGO’S PALAVER.</p><p> </p><p> WE no sooner found ourselves safe in Kasson than Demba Sego told me thatwe were now in his uncle’s dominions, and he hoped I would consider,being now out of danger, the obligation I owed to him, and make him asuitable return for the trouble he had taken on my account by a handsomepresent.  This, as he knew how much had been pilfered from me at Joag,was rather an unexpected proposition, and I began to fear that I had notmuch improved my condition by crossing the water; but as it would havebeen folly to complain I made no observation upon his conduct, and gavehim seven bars of amber and some tobacco, with which he seemed to becontent.</p><p> </p><p> After a long day’s journey, in the course of which I observed a number oflarge loose nodules of white granite, we arrived at Teesee on the eveningof December 29th, and were accommodated in Demba Sego’s hut.  The nextmorning he introduced me to his father, Tiggity Sego, brother to the kingof Kasson, chief of Teesee.  The old man viewed me with greatearnestness, having never, he said, beheld but one white man before, whomby his description I immediately knew to be Major Houghton.</p><p> </p><p> In the afternoon one of his slaves eloped; and a general alarm beinggiven, every person that had a horse rode into the woods, in the hopes ofapprehending him, and Demba Sego begged the use of my horse for the samepurpose.  I readily consented; and in about an hour they all returnedwith the slave, who was severely flogged, and afterwards put in irons.On the day following (December 31st) Demba Sego was ordered to go withtwenty horsemen to a town in Gedumah, to adjust some dispute with theMoors, a party of whom were supposed to have stolen three horses fromTeesee.  Demba begged a second the time use of my horse, adding that thesight of my bridle and saddle would give him consequence among the Moors.This request also I readily granted, and he promised to return at the endof three days.  During his absence I amused myself with walking about thetown, and conversing with the natives, who attended me everywhere withgreat kindness and curiosity, and supplied me with milk, eggs, and whatother provisions I wanted, on very easy terms.</p><p> </p><p> Teesee is a large unwalled town, having no security against the attack ofan enemy except a sort of citadel in which Tiggity and his familyconstantly reside.  This town, according to the report of the natives,was formerly inhabited only by a few Foulah shepherds, who lived inconsiderable affluence by means of the excellent meadows in theneighbourhood, in which they reared great herds of cattle.  But theirprosperity attracting the envy of some Mandingoes, the latter drove outthe shepherds, and took possession of their lands.</p><p> </p><p> The present inhabitants, though they possess both cattle and corn inabundance, are not over nice in articles of diet; rats, moles, squirrels,snakes, locusts, are eaten without scruple by the highest and lowest.  Mypeople were one evening invited to a feast given by some of the townsmen,where, after making a hearty meal of what they thought fish and kouskous,one of them found a piece of hard skin in the dish, and brought it alongwith him to show me what sort of fish they had been eating.  On examiningthe skin I found they had been feasting on a large snake.  Another customstill more extraordinary is that no woman is allowed to eat an egg.  Thisprohibition, whether arising from ancient superstition or from thecraftiness of some old bushreen who loved eggs himself, is rigidlyadhered to, and nothing will more affront a woman of Teesee than to offerher an egg.  The custom is the more singular, as the men eat eggs withoutscruple in the presence of their wives, and I never observed the sameprohibition in any other of the Mandingo countries.</p><p> </p><p> The third day after his son’s departure, Tiggity Sego held a palaver on avery extraordinary occasion, which I attended; and the debates on bothsides of the question displayed much ingenuity.  The case was this:—Ayoung man, a kafir of considerable affluence, who had recently married ayoung and handsome wife, applied to a very devout bushreen, or Mussalmanpriest, of his acquaintance, to procure him saphies for his protectionduring the approaching war.  The bushreen complied with the request; andin order, as he pretended, to render the saphies more efficacious,enjoined the young man to avoid any nuptial intercourse with his bridefor the space of six weeks.  Severe as the injunction was, the kafirstrictly obeyed; and, without telling his wife the real cause, absentedhimself from her company.  In the meantime, it began to be whispered atTeesee that the bushreen, who always performed his evening devotions atthe door of the kafir’s hut, was more intimate with the young wife thanhe ought to be.  At first the good husband was unwilling to suspect thehonour of his sanctified friend, and one whole month elapsed before anyjealousy rose in his mind, but hearing the charge repeated, he at lastinterrogated his wife on the subject, who frankly confessed that thebushreen had seduced her.  Hereupon the kafir put her into confinement,and called a palaver upon the bushreen’s conduct.  The fact was clearlyproved against him; and he was sentenced to be sold into slavery, or tofind two slaves for his redemption, according to the pleasure of thecomplainant.  The injured husband, however, was unwilling to proceedagainst his friend to such extremity, and desired rather to have himpublicly flogged before Tiggity Sego’s gate.  This was agreed to, and thesentence was immediately executed.  The culprit was tied by the hands toa strong stake; and a long black rod being brought forth, theexecutioner, after flourishing it round his head for some time, appliedit with such force and dexterity to the bushreen’s back as to make himroar until the woods resounded with his screams.  The surroundingmultitude, by their hooting and laughing, manifested how much theyenjoyed the punishment of this old gallant; and it is worthy of remarkthat the number of stripes was precisely the same as are enjoined by theMosaic law, _forty_, _save one_.</p><p> </p><p> As there appeared great probability that Teesee, from its being afrontier town, would be much exposed during the war to the predatoryincursions of the Moors of Gedumah, Tiggity Sego had, before my arrival,sent round to the neighbouring villages to beg or to purchase as muchprovisions as would afford subsistence to the inhabitants for one wholeyear, independently of the crop on the ground, which the Moors mightdestroy.  This project was well received by the country people, and theyfixed a day on which to bring all the provisions they could spare toTeesee; and as my horse was not yet returned, I went, in the afternoon ofJanuary 4th, 1796, to meet the escort with the provisions.</p><p> </p><p> It was composed of about 400 men, marching in good order, with corn andground nuts in large calabashes upon their heads.  They were preceded bya strong guard of bowmen, and followed by eight musicians or singing men.As soon as they approached the town the latter began a song, every verseof which was answered by the company, and succeeded by a few strokes onthe large drums.  In this manner they proceeded, amidst the acclamationsof the populace, till they reached the house of Tiggity Sego, where theloads were deposited; and in the evening they all assembled under thebentang tree, and spent the night in dancing and merriment.</p><p> </p><p> On the 5th of January an embassy of ten people belonging to AlmamiAbdulkader, king of Foota-Torra, a country to the west of Bondou, arrivedat Teesee; and desiring Tiggity to call an assembly of the inhabitants,announced publicly their king’s determination to this effect:—‘Thatunless all the people of Kasson would embrace the Mohammedan religion,and evince their conversion by saying eleven public prayers, he, the kingof Foota-Torra, could not possibly stand neuter in the present contest,but would certainly join his arms to those of Kajaaga.’  A message ofthis nature from so powerful a prince could not fail to create greatalarm; and the inhabitants of Teesee, after a long consultation, agreedto conform to his good pleasure, humiliating as it was to them.Accordingly, one and all publicly offered up eleven prayers, which wereconsidered a sufficient testimony of their having renounced paganism, andembraced the doctrines of the prophet.</p><p> </p><p> It was time 8th of January before Demba Sego returned with my horse; andbeing quite wearied out with the delay, I went immediately to inform hisfather that I should set out for Kooniakary early the next day.  The oldman made many frivolous objections, and at length gave me to understandthat I must not think of departing without first paying him the sameduties he was entitled to receive from all travellers; besides which heexpected, he said, some acknowledgment for his kindness towards use.Accordingly, on the morning of the 9th, my friend Demba, with a number ofpeople, came to me, and said that they were sent by Tiggity Sego for mypresent, and wished to see what goods I had appropriated for thatpurpose.  I knew that resistance was hopeless, and complaint unavailing:and being in some measure prepared by the intimation I had received thenight before, I quietly offered him seven bars of amber and five oftobacco.  After surveying these articles for some time very coolly, Dembalaid them down, and told me that this was not a present for a man ofTiggity Sego’s consequence, who had it in his power to take whatever hepleased from me.  He added, that if I did not consent to make him alarger offering he would carry all my baggage to his father, and let himchoose for himself.  I had no time for reply, for Demba and hisattendants immediately began to open my bundles, and spread the differentarticles upon the floor, where they underwent a more strict examinationthan they had done at Joag.  Everything that pleased them they tookwithout scruple: and amongst other things, Demba seized the tin box thathad so much attracted his attention in crossing the river.  Uponcollecting the scattered remains of my little fortune after these peoplehad left me, I found that, as at Joag I had been plundered of half, sohere, without even the shadow of accusation, I was deprived of half theremainder.  The blacksmith himself, though a native of Kasson, had alsobeen compelled to open his bundles, and take an oath that the differentarticles they contained were his own exclusive property.  There was,however, no remedy, and having been under some obligation to Demba Segofor his attention towards me in the journey from Joag, I did not reproachhim for his rapacity, but determined to quit Teesee, at all events, thenext morning.  In the meanwhile, in order to raise the drooping spiritsof my attendants, I purchased a fat sheep, and had it dressed for ourdinner.</p><p> </p><p> Early in the morning of January 10th, therefore, I left Teesee, and aboutmid-day ascended a ridge, from whence we had a distant view of the hillsround Kooniakary.  In the evening we reached a small village, where weslept, and, departing from thence the next morning, crossed in a fewhours a narrow but deep stream called Krieko, a branch of the Senegal.About two miles farther to the eastward we passed a large town calledMadina, and at two o’clock came in sight of Jumbo, the blacksmith’snative town, from whence he had been absent more than four years.  Soonafter this, his brother, who had by some means been apprised of hiscoming, came out to meet him, accompanied by a singing man.  He brought ahorse for the blacksmith, that he might enter his native town in adignified manner; and he desired each of us to put a good charge ofpowder into our guns.  The singing man now led the way, followed by thetwo brothers, and we were presently joined by a number of people from thetown, all of whom demonstrated great joy at seeing their old acquaintancethe blacksmith by the most extravagant jumping and singing.  On enteringthe town the singing man began an extempore song in praise of theblacksmith, extolling his courage in having overcome so manydifficulties, and concluding with a strict injunction to his friends todress him plenty of victuals.</p><p> </p><p> When we arrived at the blacksmith’s place of residence we dismounted, andfired our muskets.  The meeting between him and his relations was verytender; for these rude children of nature, free from restraint, displaytheir emotions in the strongest and most expressive manner.  Amidst thesetransports the blacksmith’s aged mother was led forth, leaning upon astaff.  Every one made way for her, and she stretched out her hand to bidher son welcome.  Being totally blind, she stroked his hands, arms, andface with great care, and seemed highly delighted that her latter dayswere blessed by his return, and that her ears once more heard the musicof his voice.</p><p> </p><p> During the tumult of these congratulations I had seated myself apart bythe side of one of the huts, being unwilling to interrupt the flow offilial and parental tenderness; and the attention of the company was soentirely taken up with the blacksmith that I believe none of his friendshad observed me.  When all the people present had seated themselves theblacksmith was desired by his father to give them some account of hisadventures; and silence being commanded, he began, and after repeatedlythanking God for the success that had attended him, related everymaterial occurrence that had happened to him from his leasing Kasson tohis arrival at the Gambia, his employment and success in those parts, andthe dangers he had escaped in returning to his native country.  In thelatter part of his narration he had frequently occasion to mention me;and after many strong expressions concerning my kindness to him hepointed to the place where I sat, and exclaimed, “_Affille ibisiring_!”—(“See him sitting there!”)  In a moment all eyes were turnedupon me; I appeared like a being dropped from the clouds; every one wassurprised that they had not observed me before; and a few women andchildren expressed great uneasiness at being so near a man of such anuncommon appearance.</p><p> </p><p> By degrees, however, their apprehensions subsided, and when theblacksmith assured them that I was perfectly inoffensive, and would hurtnobody, some of them ventured so far as to examine the texture of myclothes; but many of them were still very suspicious; and when byaccident I happened to move myself, or look at the young children, theirmothers would scamper off with them with the greatest precipitations.  Ina few hours, however, they all because reconciled to me.</p><p> </p><p> With these worthy people I spent the remainder of that and the whole ofthe ensuing day, in feasting and merriment; and the blacksmith declaredhe would not quit me during my stay at Kooniakary—for which place we setout early on the morning of the 14th of January, and arrived about themiddle of the day at Soolo, a small village three miles to the south ofit.</p><p> </p><p> As this place was somewhat out of the direct road, it is necessary toobserve that I went thither to visit a slatee or Gambia trader, of greatnote and reputation, named Salim Daucari.  He was well known to Dr.Laidley, who had trusted him with effects to the value of five slaves,and had given me an order for the whole of the debt.  We luckily foundhim at home, and he received me with great kindness and attention.</p><p> </p><p> It is remarkable, however, that the king of Kasson was by some meansimmediately apprised of my motions; for I had been at Soolo but a fewhours before Sambo Sego, his second son, came thither with a party ofhorse, to inquire what had prevented me from proceeding to Kooniakary,and waiting immediately upon the king, who, he said, was impatient to seeme.  Salim Daucari made my apology, and promised to accompany me toKooniakary the same evening.  We accordingly departed from Soolo atsunset, and in about an hour entered Kooniakary.  But as the king hadgone to sleep we deferred the interview till next morning, and slept atthe hut of Sambo Sego.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER VII.INTERVIEW WITH KING DEMBA SEGO JALLA.</p><p> </p><p> ABOUT eight o’clock in the morning of January 15th, 1796, we went to anaudience of the king (Demba Sego Jalla), but the crowd of people to seeme was so great that I could scarcely get admittance.  A passage being atlength obtained, I made my bow to the monarch, whom we found sitting upona mat, in a large hut.  He appeared to be a man of about sixty years ofage.  His success in war, and the mildness of his behaviour in time ofpeace, had much endeared him to all his subjects.  He surveyed me withgreat attention; and when Salim Daucari explained to him the object of myjourney, and my reasons for passing through his country, the good oldking appeared not only perfectly satisfied, but promised me everyassistance in his power.  He informed me that he had seen Major Houghton,and presented him with a white horse; but that, after crossing thekingdom of Kaarta, he had lost his life among the Moors, in what mannerhe could not inform me.  When this audience was ended we returned to ourlodging, and I made up a small present for the king out of the feweffects that were left me; for I had not yet received anything from SalimDaucari.  This present, though inconsiderable in itself, was wellreceived by the king, who sent me in return a large white bullock.  Thesight of this animal quite delighted my attendants; not so much onaccount of its bulk, as from its being of a white colour, which isconsidered as a particular mark of favour.  But although the king himselfwas well disposed towards me, and readily granted me permission to passthrough his territories, I soon discovered that very great and unexpectedobstacles were likely to impede my progress.  Besides the war which wason the point of breaking out between Kasson and Kajaaga, I was told thatthe next kingdom of Kaarta, through which my route lay, was involved inthe issue, and was furthermore threatened with hostilities on the part ofBambarra.  The king himself informed me of these circumstances, andadvised me to stay in the neighbourhood of Kooniakary till such time ashe could procure proper information respecting Bambarra, which heexpected to do in the course of four or five days, as he had already, hesaid, sent four messengers into Kaarta for that purpose.  I readilysubmitted to this proposal, and went to Soolo, to stay there till thereturn of one of those messengers.  This afforded me a favourableopportunity of receiving what money Salim Daucari could spare me on Dr.Laidley’s account.  I succeeded in receiving the value of there slaves,chiefly in gold dust; and being anxious to proceed as quickly aspossible, I begged Daucari to use his interest with the king to allow mea guide by the way of Fooladoo, as I was informed that the war hadalready commenced between the kings of Bambarra and Kaarta.  Daucariaccordingly set out for Kooniakary on the morning of the 20th, and thesame evening returned with the king’s answer, which was to thispurpose—that the king had, many years ago, made an agreement with Daisy,king of Kaarta, to send all merchants and travellers through hisdominions; but that if I wished to take the route through Fooladoo I hadhis permission so to do; though he could not, consistently with hisagreement, lend me a guide.  Having felt the want of regal protection ina former part of my journey, I was unwilling to hazard a repetition ofthe hardships I had then experienced, especially as the money I hadreceived was probably the last supply that I should obtain.  I thereforedetermined to wait for the return of the messengers from Kaarta.</p><p> </p><p> In the interim it began to be whispered abroad that I had received plentyof gold from Salim Daucari, and, on the morning of the 23rd, Sambo Segopaid me a visit, with a party of horsemen.  He insisted upon knowing theexact amount of the money I had obtained, declaring that whatever the sumwas, one-half of it must go to the king; besides which he intimated thathe expected a handsome present for himself, as being the king’s son, andfor his attendants, as being the king’s relations.  I prepared to submit;and if Salim Daucari had not interposed all my endeavours to mitigatethis oppressive claim would have been of no avail.  Salim at lastprevailed upon Sambo to accept sixteen bars of European merchandise, andsome powder and ball, as a complete payment of every demand that could bemade upon me in the kingdom of Kasson.</p><p> </p><p> _January_ 26.—In the forenoon I went to the top of a high hill to thesouthward of Soolo, where I had a most enchanting prospect of thecountry.  The number of towns and villages, and the extensive cultivationaround them, surpassed everything I had yet seen in Africa.  A grosscalculation may be formed of the number of inhabitants in this delightfulplain by considering that the king of Kasson can raise four thousandfighting men by the sound of his war-drum.  In traversing the rockyeminences of this hill, which are almost destitute of vegetation, Iobserved a number of large holes in the crevasses and fissures of therocks, where the wolves and hyænas take refuge during the day.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 1.—The messengers arrived from Kaarta, and broughtintelligence that the war had not yet commenced between Bambarra andKaarta, and that I might probably pass through Kaarta before the Bambarraarmy invaded that country.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 3.—Early in the morning two guides on horseback came fromKooniakary to conduct me to the frontiers of Kaarta.  I accordingly tookleave of Salim Daucari, and parted for the last time from myfellow-traveller the blacksmith, whose kind solicitude for my welfare hadbeen so conspicuous, and about ten o’clock departed from Soolo.  Wetravelled this day through a rocky and hilly country, along the banks ofthe river Krieko, and at sunset came to the village of Soomo, where weslept.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 4.—We departed from Soomo, and continued our route along thebanks of the Krieko, which are everywhere well cultivated, and swarm withinhabitants.  At this time they were increased by the number of peoplethat had flown thither from Kaarta on account of the Bambarra war.  Inthe afternoon we reached Kimo, a large village, the residence of MadiKonko, governor of the hilly country of Kasson, which is called Sorroma.From hence the guides appointed by the king of Kasson returned, to joinin the expedition against Kajaaga; and I waited until the 6th before Icould prevail on Madi Konko to appoint me a guide to Kaarta.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 7.—Departing from Kimo, with Madi Konko’s son as a guide, wecontinued our course along the banks of the Krieko until the afternoon,when we arrived at Kangee, a considerable town.  The Krieko is here but asmall rivulet.  This beautiful stream takes its rise a little to theeastward of this town, and descends with a rapid and noisy current untilit reaches the bottom of the high hill called Tappa, where it becomesmore placid, and winds gently through the lovely plains of Kooniakary;after which, having received an additional branch from the north, it islost in the Senegal, somewhere near the falls of Felow.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 8.—This day we travelled over a rough stony country, andhaving passed Seimpo and a number of other villages, arrived in theafternoon at Lackarago, a small village which stands upon the ridge ofhills that separates the kingdoms of Kasson and Kaarta.  In the course ofthe day we passed many hundreds of people flying from Kaarta with theirfamilies and effects.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 9.—Early in the morning we departed from Lackarago, and alittle to the eastward came to the brow of a hill from whence we had anextensive view of the country.  Towards the south-east were perceivedsome very distant hills, which our guide told us were the mountains ofFooladoo.  We travelled with great difficulty down a stony and abruptprecipice, and continued our way in the bed of a dry river course, wherethe trees, meeting overhead, made the place dark and cool.  In a littletime we reached the bottom of this romantic glen, and about ten o’clockemerged from between two rocky hills, and found ourselves on the leveland sandy plains of Kaarta.  At noon we arrived at a _korree_, orwatering place, where for a few strings of beads I purchased as much milkand corn-meal as we could eat; indeed, provisions are here so cheap, andthe shepherds live in such affluence, that they seldom ask any return forwhat refreshments a traveller receives from them.  From this korree wereached Feesurah at sunset, where we took up our lodging for the night.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 10.—We continued at Feesurah all this day, to have a fewclothes washed, and learn more exactly the situation of affairs before weventured towards the capital.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 11—Our landlord, taking advantage of the unsettled state ofthe country, demanded so extravagant a sum for our lodging that,suspecting he wished for an opportunity to quarrel with us, I refused tosubmit to his exorbitant demand; but my attendants were so muchfrightened at the reports of approaching war that they refused to proceedany farther unless I could settle matters with him, and induce him toaccompany us to Kemoo, for our protection on the road.  This Iaccomplished with some difficulty; and by a present of a blanket which Ihad brought with me to sleep in, and for which our landlord had conceiveda very great liking, matters were at length amicably adjusted, and hemounted his horse and led the way.  He was one of those negroes who,together with the ceremonial part of the Mohammedan religion, retain alltheir ancient superstitions, and even drink strong liquors.  They arecalled Johars, or Jowars, and in this kingdom form a very numerous andpowerful tribe.  We had no sooner got into a dark need lonely part of thefirst wood than he made a sign for us to stop, and, taking hold of ahollow piece of bamboo that hung as an amulet round his neck, whistledvery loud there times.  I confess I was somewhat startled, thinking itwas a signal for some of his companions to come and attack us; but heassured me that it was done merely with a view to ascertain what successwe were likely to meet with on our present journey.  He then dismounted,laid his spear across the road, and having said a number of shortprayers, concluded with three loud whistles; after which he listened forsome time, as if in expectation of an answer, and receiving none, told uswe might proceed without fear, for there was no danger.  About noon wepassed a number of large villages quite deserted, the inhabitants havingfled into Kasson to avoid the horrors of war.  We reached Karankalla atsunset.  This formerly was a large town, but having been plundered by theBambarrans about four years ago, nearly one-half of it is still in ruins.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 12.—At daylight we departed from Karankalla, and as it was buta short day’s journey to Kemmoo, we travelled slower than usual, andamused ourselves by collecting such eatable fruits as grew near theroad-side.  About noon we saw at a distance the capital of Kaarta,situated in the middle of an open plain—the country for two miles roundbeing cleared of wood, by the great consumption of that article forbuilding and fuel—and we entered the town about two o’clock in theafternoon.</p><p> </p><p> We proceeded without stopping to the court before the king’s residence;but I was so completely surrounded by the gazing multitude that I did notattempt to dismount, but sent in the landlord and Madi Konki’s son, toacquaint the king of my arrival.  In a little time they returned,accompanied by a messenger from the king, signifying that he would see mein the evening; and in the meantime the messenger had orders to procureme a lodging and see that the crowd did not molest me.  He conducted meinto a court, at the door of which he stationed a man with a stick in hishand to keep off the mob, and then showed me a large hut in which I wasto lodge.  I had scarcely seated myself in this spacious apartment whenthe mob entered; it was found impossible to keep them out, and I wassurrounded by as many as the hut could contain.  When the first party,however, had seen me, and asked a few questions, they retired to makeroom for another company; and in this manner the hut was filled andemptied thirteen different times.</p><p> </p><p> A little before sunset the king sent to inform me that he was at leisure,and wished to see me.  I followed the messenger through a number ofcourts surrounded with high walls, where I observed plenty of dry grass,bundled up like hay, to fodder the horses, in case the town should beinvested.  On entering the court in which the king was sitting I wasastonished at the number of his attendants, and at the good order thatseemed to prevail among them; they were all seated—the fighting men onthe king’s right hand and the women and children on the left, leaving aspace between them for my passage.  The king, whose name was DaisyKoorabarri, was not to be distinguished from his subjects by anysuperiority in point of dress; a bank of earth, about two feet high, uponwhich was spread a leopard’s skin, constituted the only mark of royaldignity.  When I had seated myself upon the ground before him, andrelated the various circumstances that had induced me to pass through hiscountry, and my reasons for soliciting his protections, he appearedperfectly satisfied; but said it was not in his power at present toafford me much assistance, for that all sort of communication betweenKaarta and Bambarra had been interrupted for some time past; and asMansong, the king of Bambarra, with his army, had entered Fooladoo in hisway to Kaarta, there was but little hope of my reaching Bambarra by anyof the usual routes, inasmuch as, coming from an enemy’s country, Ishould certainly be plundered, or taken for a spy.  If his country hadbeen at peace, he said, I might have remained with him until a morefavourable opportunity offered; but, as matters stood at present, he didnot wish me to continue in Kaarta, for fear some accident should befallme, in which case my countrymen might say that he had murdered a whiteman.  He would therefore advise me to return into Kasson, and remainthere until the war should terminate, which would probably happen in thecourse of three or four months, after which, if he was alive, he said, hewould be glad to see me, and if he was dead his sons would take care ofme.</p><p> </p><p> This advice was certainly well meant on the part of the king, and perhapsI was to blame in not following it; but I reflected that the hot monthswere approaching, and I dreaded the thoughts of spending the rainy seasonin the interior of Africa.  These considerations, and the aversion I feltat the idea of returning without having made a greater progress indiscovery, made sue determine to go forward; and though the king couldnot give me a guide to Bambarra, I begged that he would allow a man toaccompany me as near the frontiers of his kingdom as was consistent withsafety.  Finding that I was determined to proceed, the king told me thatone route still remained, but that, he said, was by no means free fromdanger—which was to go from Kaarta into the Moorish kingdom of Ludamar,from whence I might pass by a circuitous route into Bambarra.  If Iwished to follow this route he would appoint people to conduct me toJarra, the frontier town of Ludamar.  He then inquired very particularlyhow I had been treated since I had left the Gambia, and asked, in ajocular way, how many slaves I expected to carry home with me on myreturn.  He was about to proceed when a man mounted on a fine Moorishhorse, which was covered with sweat and foam, entered the court, andsignifying that he had something of importance to communicate, the kingimmediately took up his sandals, which is the signal to strangers toretire.  I accordingly took leave, but desired my boy to stay about theplace, in order to learn something of the intelligence that thismessenger had brought.  In about an hour the boy returned, and informedme that the Bambarra army had left Fooladoo, and was on its march towardsKaarta; that the man I had seen, who had brought this intelligence, wasone of the scouts, or watchmen, employed by the king, each of whom hashis particular station (commonly on some rising ground) from whence hehas the best view of the country, and watches the motions of the enemy.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 13.—At daylight I sent my horse-pistols and holsters as apresent to the king, and being very desirous to get away from a placewhich was likely soon to become the seat of war, I begged the messengerto inform the king that I wished to depart from Kemmoo as soon as heshould find it convenient to appoint me a guide.  In about an hour theking sent his messenger to thank me for the present, and eight horsemento conduct me to Jarra.  They told me that the king wished me to proceedto Jarra with all possible expedition, that they might return beforeanything decisive should happen between the armies of Bambarra needKaarta.  We accordingly departed forthwith from Kemmoo, accompanied bythree of Daisy’s sons, and about two hundred horsemen, who kindlyundertook to see me a little way on my journey.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER VIII.ADVENTURES BETWEEN KEMMOO AND JARRA.</p><p> </p><p> ON the evening of the day of our departure from Kemmoo (the king’s eldestson and great part of the horsemen having returned) we reached a villagecalled Marina, where we slept.  During the night some thieves broke intothe hut where I had deposited my baggage, and having cut open one of mybundles, stole a quantity of beads, part of my clothes, and some amberand gold, which happened to be in one of the pockets.  I complained to myprotectors, but without effect.  The next day (February 14th) was faradvanced before we departed from Marina, and we travelled slowly, onaccount of the excessive heat, until four o’clock in the afternoon, whentwo negroes were observed sitting among some thorny bushes, at a littledistance from the road.  The king’s people, taking it for granted thatthey were runaway slaves, cocked their muskets, and rode at full speed indifferent directions through the bushes, in order to surround them, andprevent their escaping.  The negroes, however, waited with greatcomposure until we came within bowshot of them, when each of them tookfrom his quiver a handful of arrows, and putting two between his teethand one in his bow, waved to us with his hand to keep at a distance; uponwhich one of the king’s people called out to the strangers to give someaccount of themselves.  They said that “they were natives of Toorda, aneighbouring village, and had come to that place to gather _tomberongs_.”These are small farinaceous berries, of a yellow colour and delicioustaste, which I knew to be the fruit of the _rhamnus lotus_ of Linnæus.</p><p> </p><p> The lotus is very common in all the kingdoms which I visited; but isfound in the greatest plenty on the sandy soil of Kaarta, Ludamar, andthe northern parts of Bambarra, where it is one of the most common shrubsof the country.  I had observed the same species at Gambia.</p><p> </p><p> As this shrub is found in Tunis, and also in the negro kingdoms, and asit furnishes the natives of the latter with a food resembling bread, andalso with a sweet liquor which is much relished by them, there can belittle doubt of its being the lotus mentioned by Pliny as the food of theLibyan Lotophagi.  An army may very well have been fed with the bread Ihave tasted, made of the meal of the fruit, as is said by Pliny to havebeen done in Libya; and as the taste of the bread is sweet and agreeable,it is not likely that the soldiers would complain of it.</p><p> </p><p> We arrived in the evening at the village of Toorda; when all the rest ofthe king’s people turned back except two, who remained with me as guidesto Jarra.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 15.—I departed from Toorda, and about two o’clock came to aconsiderable town, called Funingkedy.  As we approached the town theinhabitants were much alarmed; for, as one of my guides wore a turban,they mistook us for some Moorish banditti.  This misapprehension was sooncleared up, and we were well received by a Gambia slatee, who resides atthis town, and at whose house we lodged.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 16.—We were informed that a number of people would go fromthis town to Jarra on the day following; and as the road was muchinfested by the Moors we resolved to stay and accompany the travellers.</p><p> </p><p> About two o’clock, as I was lying asleep upon a bullock’s hide behind thedoor of the hut, I was awakened by the screams of women, and a generalclamour and confusion among the inhabitants.  At first I suspected thatthe Bambarrans had actually entered the town; but observing my boy uponthe top of one of the huts, I called to him to know what was the matter.He informed me that the Moors were come a second time to steal thecattle, and that they were now close to the town.  I mounted the roof ofthe hut, and observed a large herd of bullocks coming towards the town,followed by five Moors on horseback, who drove the cattle forward withtheir muskets.  When they had reached the wells which are close to thetown, the Moors selected from the herd sixteen of the finest beasts, anddrove them off at full cell gallop.  During this transaction thetownspeople, to the number of five hundred, stood collected close to thewalls of the town; and when the Moors drove the cattle away, though theypassed within pistol-shot of them, the inhabitants scarcely made a showof resistance.  I only saw four muskets fired, which, being loaded withgunpowder of the negroes’ own manufacture, did no execution.  Shortlyafter this I observed a number of people supporting a young man onhorseback, and conducting him slowly towards the town.  This was one ofthe herdsmen, who, attempting to throw his spear, had been wounded by ashot from one of the Moors.  His mother walked on before, quite franticwith grief, clapping her hands, and enumerating the good qualities of herson.  “_Ee maffo fenio_!”  (“He never told a lie!”) said the disconsolatemother as her wounded son was carried in at the gate—“_Ee maffo fonioabada_!”  (“He never told a lie; no, never!”)  When they had conveyed himto his hut, and laid him upon a mat, all the spectators joined inlamenting his fate, by screaming and howling in the most piteous manner.</p><p> </p><p> After their grief had subsided a little, I was desired to examine thewound.  I found that the ball had passed quite through his leg, havingfractured both bones a little below the knee: the poor boy was faint fromthe loss of blood, and his situation withal so very precarious, that Icould not console his relations with any great hopes of his recovery.However, to give him a possible chance, I observed to them that it wasnecessary to cut off his leg above the knee.  This proposal made everyone start with horror; they had never heard of such a method of cure, andwould by no means give their consent to it; indeed, they evidentlyconsidered me a sort of cannibal for proposing so cruel and unheard-of anoperation, which, in their opinion, would be attended with more pain anddanger than the wound itself.  The patient was therefore committed to thecare of some old bashreens, who endeavoured to secure him a passage intoparadise by whispering in his ear some Arabic sentences, and desiring himto repeat them.  After many unsuccessful attempts, the poor heathen atlast pronounced, “_La illah el Allah_, _Mahamet rasowl allahi_”  (“Thereis but one God, and Mohammed is his Prophet”); and the disciples of theProphet assured his mother that her son had given sufficient evidence ofhis faith, and would be happy in a future state.  He died the sameevening.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 17.—My guides informed me that in order to avoid the Moorishbanditti it was necessary to travel in the night; we accordingly departedfrom Funingkedy in the afternoon, accompanied by about thirty people,carrying their effects with them into Ludamar, for fear of the war.  Wetravelled with great silence and expedition until midnight, when westopped in a sort of enclosure, near a small village; but the thermometerbeing so low as 68 degrees, none of the negroes could sleep on account ofthe cold.</p><p> </p><p> At daybreak on the 18th we resumed our journey, and at eight o’clockpassed Simbing, the frontier village of Ludamar, situated on a narrowpass between two rocky hills, and surrounded with a high wall.  From thisvillage Major Houghton (being deserted by his negro servants, who refusedto follow him into the Moorish country) wrote his last letter with apencil to Dr. Laidley.  This brave but unfortunate man, heavingsurmounted many difficulties, had taken a northerly direction, hadendeavoured to pass through the kingdom of Ludamar, where I afterwardslearned the following particulars concerning his melancholy fate:—On hisarrival at Jarra he got acquainted with certain Moorish merchants whowere travelling to Tisheet (a place near the salt pits in the GreatDesert, ten days’ journey to the northward) to purchase salt; and theMajor, at the expense of a musket and some tobacco, engaged them toconvey him thither.  It is impossible to form any other opinion on thisdetermination than that the Moors intentionally deceived him, either withregard to the route that he wished to pursue, or the state of theintermediate country between Jarra and Timbuctoo.  Their intentionprobably was to rob and leave him in the desert.  At the end of two dayshe suspected their treachery, and insisted on returning to Jarra.Finding him persist in this determination, the Moors robbed him ofeverything he possessed, and went off with their camels; the poor Majorbeing thus deserted, returned on foot to a watering-place in possessionof the Moors, called Tarra.  He had been some days without food, and theunfeeling Moors refusing to give him any, he sank at last under hisdistresses.  Whether he actually perished of hunger, or was murderedoutright by the savage Mohammedans, is not certainly known; his body wasdragged into the woods, and I was shown at a distance the spot where hisremains were left to perish.</p><p> </p><p> About four miles to the north of Simbing we came to a small stream ofwater, where we observed a number of wild horses they were all of onecolour, and galloped away from us at an easy rate, frequently stoppingand looking back.  The negroes hunt them for food, and their flesh ismuch esteemed.</p><p> </p><p> About noon we arrived at Jarra, a large town situated at the bottom ofsome rocky hills.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER IX.THE TOWN OF JARRA—DETAINED BY THE MOORS.</p><p> </p><p> THE town of Jarra is of considerable extent; the houses are built of clayand stone intermixed—the clay answering the purpose of mortar.  It issituated in the Moorish kingdom of Ludamar; but the major part of theinhabitants are negroes, from the borders of the southern states, whoprefer a precarious protection under the Moors, which they purchase by atribute, rather than continue exposed to their predatory hostilities.The tribute they pay is considerable; and they manifest towards theirMoorish superiors the most unlimited obedience and submission, and aretreated by them with the utmost indignity and contempt.  The Moors ofthis and the other states adjoining the country of the negroes resemblein their persons the mulattoes of the West Indies to so great a degree asnot easily to be distinguished from them; and, in truth, the presentgeneration seem to be a mixed race between the Moors (properly so called)of the north and the negroes of the south, possessing many of the worstqualities of both nations.</p><p> </p><p> Of the origin of these Moorish tribes, as distinguished from theinhabitants of Barbary, from whom they are divided by the Great Desert,nothing further seems to be known than what is related by John Leo, theAfrican, whose account may be abridged as follows:—</p><p> </p><p> Before the Arabian conquest, about the middle of the seventh century, allthe inhabitants of Africa, whether they were descended from Numidians,Phœnicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, or Goths, were comprehendedunder the general name of _Mauri_, or Moors.  All these nations wereconverted to the religion of Mohammed during the Arabian empire under theKaliphs.  About this time many of the Numidian tribes, who led awandering life in the desert, and supported themselves upon the produceof their cattle, retired southward across the Great Desert to avoid thefury of the Arabians; and by one of those tribes, says Leo (that ofZanhaga), were discovered, and conquered, the negro nations on the Niger.By the Niger is here undoubtedly meant the river of Senegal, which in theMandingo language is _Bafing_, or the Black River.</p><p> </p><p> To what extent these people are now spread over the African continent itis difficult to ascertain.  There is reason to believe that theirdominion stretches from west to east, in a narrow line or belt, from themouth of the Senegal (on the northern side of that river) to the confinesof Abyssinia.  They are a subtle and treacherous race of people, and takeevery opportunity of cheating and plundering the credulous andunsuspecting negroes.  But their manners and general habits of life willbe best explained as incidents occur in the course of my narrative.</p><p> </p><p> The difficulties we had already encountered, the unsettled state of thecountry, and, above all, the savage and overbearing deportment of theMoors, had so completely frightened my attendants that they declared theywould rather relinquish every claim to reward than proceed one stepfarther to the eastward.  Indeed, the danger they incurred of beingseized by the Moors, and sold into slavery, became every day moreapparent; and I could not condemn their apprehensions.  In thissituation, deserted by my attendants, and reflecting that my retreat wascut off by the war behind me, and that a Moorish country of ten days’journey lay before me, I applied to Daman to obtain permission from Ali,the chief or sovereign of Ludamar, that I might pass through his countryunmolested into Bambarra; and I hired one of Daman’s slaves to accompanyme thither, as soon as such permission should be obtained.  A messengerwas despatched to Ali, who at this time was encamped near Benowm; and asa present was necessary in order to insure success, I sent him fivegarments of cotton cloth, which I purchased of Daman for one of myfowling-pieces.  Fourteen days elapsed in settling this affair; but onthe evening of the 26th of February, one of Ali’s slaves arrived withdirections, as he pretended, to conduct me in safety as far as Goomba,and told me I was to pay him one garment of blue cotton cloth for hisattendance.  My faithful boy, observing that I was about to proceedwithout him, resolved to accompany me; and told me, that though he wishedme to turn back, he never entertained any serious thoughts of desertingme, but had been advised to it by Johnson, with a view to induce me toturn immediately for Gambia.</p><p> </p><p> _February_ 27.—I delivered most of my papers to Johnson, to convey themto Gambia as soon as possible, reserving a duplicate for myself in caseof accidents.  I likewise left in Daman’s possession a bundle of clothes,and other things that were not absolutely necessary, for I wished todiminish my baggage as much as possible, that the Moors might have fewerinducements to plunder us.</p><p> </p><p> Things being thus adjusted, we departed from Jarra in the forenoon, andslept at Troomgoomba, a small walled village, inhabited by a mixture ofnegroes and Moors.  On the day following (February 28th) we reachedQuira; and on the 29th, after a toilsome journey over a sandy country, wecame to Compe, a watering-place belonging to the Moors; from whence, onthe morning following, we proceeded to Deena, a large town, and, likeJarra, built of stone and clay.  The Moors are here in greater proportionto the negroes than at Jarra.  They assembled round the hut of the negrowhere I lodged, and treated me with the greatest insolence; they hissed,shouted, and abused me; they even spat in my face, with a view toirritate me, and afford them a pretext for seizing my baggage.  Butfinding such insults had not the desired effect, they had recourse to thefinal and decisive argument, that I was a Christian, and of course thatmy property was lawful plunder to the followers of Mohammed.  Theyaccordingly opened my bundles, and robbed me of everything they fancied.My attendants, finding that everybody could rob me with impunity,insisted on returning to Jarra.</p><p> </p><p> The day following (March 2nd), I endeavoured, by all the means in mypower, to prevail upon my people to go on, but they still continuedobstinate; and having reason to fear some further insult from the fanaticMoors, I resolved to proceed alone.  Accordingly, the next morning, abouttwo o’clock, I departed from Deena.  It was moonlight, but the roaring ofthe wild beasts made it necessary to proceed with caution.</p><p> </p><p> When I had reached a piece of rising ground about half a mile from thetown, I heard somebody halloo, and, looking back, saw my faithful boyrunning after me.  He informed me that Ali’s men had gone back to Benowm,and that Daman’s negro was about to depart for Jarra; but he said he hadno doubt, if I would stop a little, that he could persuade the latter toaccompany us.  I waited accordingly, and in about an hour the boyreturned with the negro; and we continued travelling over a sandycountry, covered chiefly with the _Asclepias gigantea_, until mid-day,when we came to a number of deserted huts; and seeing some appearances ofwater at a little distance, I sent the boy to fill a soofroo; but as hewas examining the place for water, the roaring of a lion, that wasprobably on the same pursuit, induced the frightened boy to return inhaste, and we submitted patiently to the disappointment.  In theafternoon we reached a town inhabited chiefly by Foulahs, calledSamaming-koos.</p><p> </p><p> Next morning (March 4th), we set out for Sampaka, which place we reachedabout two o’clock.  On the road we observed immense quantities oflocusts; the trees were quite black with them.</p><p> </p><p> Sampaka is a large town, and when the Moors and Bambarrans were at warwas thrice attacked by the former; but they were driven off with greatloss, though the king of Bambarra was afterwards obliged to give up this,and all the other towns as far as Goomba, in order to obtain a peace.Here I lodged at the house of a negro who practised the art of makinggunpowder.  He showed me a bag of nitre, very white, but the crystalswere much smaller than common.  They procure it in considerablequantities from the ponds, which are filled in the rainy season, and towhich the cattle resort for coolness during the heat of the day.  Whenthe water is evaporated, a white efflorescence is observed on the mud,which the natives collect and purify in such a manner as to answer theirpurpose.  The Moors supply them with sulphur from the Mediterranean; andthe process is completed by pounding the different articles together in awooden mortar.  The grains are very unequal, and the sound of itsexplosion is by no means so sharp as that produced by European gunpowder.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 5.—We departed from Sampaka at daylight.  About noon we stopped alittle at a village called Dangali, and in the evening arrived at Dalli.We saw upon the road two large herds of camels feeding.  When the Moorsturn their camels to feed they tie up one of their fore-legs to preventtheir straying.  This happened to be a feast-day at Dalli, and the peoplewere dancing before the dooty’s house.  But when they were informed thata white man was come into the town they left off dancing and came to theplace where I lodged, walking in regular order, two and two, with themusic before them.  They play upon a sort of flute; but instead ofblowing into a hole in the side they blow obliquely over the end, whichis half shut by a thin piece of wood; they govern the holes on the sidewith their fingers, and play some simple and very plaintive airs.  Theycontinued to dance and sing until midnight, during which time I wassurrounded by so great a crowd as made it necessary for me to satisfytheir curiosity by sitting still.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 6.—We stopped here this morning because some of the townspeople,who were going for Goomba on the day following, wished to accompany us;but in order to avoid the crowd of people which usually assembled in theevening we went to a negro village to the east of Dalli, called Samee,where we were kindly received by the hospitable dooty, who on thisoccasion killed two fine sheep, and invited his friends to come and feastwith him.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 7.—Our landlord was so proud of the honour of entertaining awhite man that he insisted on my staying with him and his friends untilthe cool of the evening, when he said he would conduct me to the nextvillage.  As I was now within two days’ journey of Goomba, I had noapprehensions from the Moors, and readily accepted the invitation.  Ispent the forenoon very pleasantly with these poor negroes; their companywas the more acceptable, as the gentleness of their manners presented astriking contrast to the rudeness and barbarity of the Moors.  Theyenlivened their conversation by drinking a fermented liquor made fromcorn—the same sort of beer that I have described in a former chapter; andbetter I never tasted in Great Britain.</p><p> </p><p> In the midst of this harmless festivity, I flattered myself that alldanger from the Moors was over.  Fancy had already placed me on the banksof the Niger, and presented to my imagination a thousand delightfulscenes in my future progress, when a party of Moors unexpectedly enteredthe hut, and dispelled the golden dream.  They came, they said, by Ali’sorders, to convey me to his camp at Benowm.  If I went peaceably, theytold me, I had nothing to fear; but if I refused they had orders to bringme by force.  I was struck dumb by surprise and terror, which the Moorsobserving endeavoured to calm my apprehensions by repeating the assurancethat I had nothing to fear.  Their visit, they added, was occasioned bythe curiosity of Ali’s wife Fatima, who had heard so much aboutChristians that she was very anxious to see one: as soon as her curiosityshould be satisfied, they had no doubt, they said, that Ali would give mea handsome present, and send a person to conduct me to Bambarra.  Findingentreaty and resistance equally fruitless, I prepared to follow themessengers, and took leave of my landlord and his company with greatreluctance.  Accompanied by my faithful boy (for Daman’s slave made hisescape on seeing the Moors), we reached Dalli in the evening, where wewere strictly watched by the Moors during the night.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 8.—We were conducted by a circuitous path through the woods toDangali, where we slept.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 9.—We continued our journey, and in the afternoon arrived atSampaka.</p><p> </p><p> Next morning (March 10th) we set out for Samaming-koos.  On the road weovertook a woman and two boys with an ass; she informed us that she wasgoing for Bambarra, but had been stopped on the road by a party of Moors,who had taken most of her clothes and some gold from her; and that shewould be under the necessity of returning to Deena till the fast moon wasover.  The same even the new moon was seen which ushered in the monthRamadan.  Large fires were made in different parts of the town, and agreater quantity of victuals than usual dressed upon the occasion.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 11.—By daylight the Moors were in readiness; but as I hadsuffered much from thirst on the road I made my boy fill a soofroo ofwater for my own use, for the Moors assured me that they should not tasteeither meat or drink until sunset.  However, I found that the excessiveheat of the sun, and the dust we raised in travelling, overcame theirscruples, and made my soofroo a very useful part of our baggage.  On ourarrival at Deena, I went to pay my respects to one of Ali’s sons.  Ifound him sitting in a low hut, with five or six more of his companions,washing their hands and feet, and frequently taking water into theirmouths, gargling and spitting it out again.  I was no sooner seated thanhe handed me a double-barrelled gun, and told me to dye the stock of ablue colour, and repair one of the locks.  I found great difficulty inpersuading him that I knew nothing about the matter.  “However,” says he,“if you cannot repair the gun, you shall give me some knives and scissorsimmediately;” and when my boy, who acted as interpreter, assured him thatI had no such articles, he hastily snatched up a musket that stood byhim, cocked it, and putting the muzzle close to the boy’s ear, wouldcertainly have shot him dead upon the spot had not the Moors wrested themusket from him, and made signs for us to retreat.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 12.—We departed from Deena towards Benowm, and about nine o’clockcame to a korree, whence the Moors were preparing to depart to thesouthward, on account of the scarcity of water; here we filled oursoofroo, and continued our journey over a hot sandy country, covered withsmall stunted shrubs, until about one o’clock, when the heat of the sunobliged us to stop.  But our water being expended, we could not prudentlyremain longer than a few minutes to collect a little gum, which is anexcellent succedaneum for water, as it keeps the mouth moist, and allaysfor a time the pain in the throat.</p><p> </p><p> About five o’clock we came in sight of Benowm, the residence of Ali.  Itpresented to the eye a great number of dirty-looking tents, scatteredwithout order over a large space of ground; and among the tents appearedlarge herds of camels, cattle, and goats.  We reached the skirts of thiscamp a little before sunset, and, with much entreaty, procured a littlewater.  My arrival was no sooner observed than the people who drew waterat the wells threw down their buckets; those in the tents mounted theirhorses, and men, women, and children, came running or galloping towardsme.  I soon found myself surrounded by such a crowd that I could scarcelymove; one pulled my clothes, another took off my hat, a third stopped meto examine my waistcoat-buttons, and a fourth called out, “_La illah elAllah_, _Mahamet rasowl allahi_”—(“There is but one God, and Mohammed ishis Prophet”)—and signified, in a threatening manner, that I must repeatthose words.  We reached at length the king’s tent, where we found agreat number of people, men and women, assembled.  Ali was sitting upon ablack leather cushion, clipping a few hairs from his upper lip, a femaleattendant holding up a looking-glass before him.  He appeared to be anold man of the Arab cast, with a long white beard; and he had a sullenand indignant aspect.  He surveyed me with attention, and inquired of theMoors if I could speak Arabic.  Being answered in the negative, heappeared much surprised, and continued silent.  The surroundingattendants, and especially the ladies, were abundantly more inquisitive:they asked a thousand questions, inspected every part of my apparel,searched my pockets, and obliged me to unbutton my waistcoat, and displaythe whiteness of my skin; they even counted my toes and fingers, as ifthey doubted whether I was in truth a human being.  In a little time thepriest announced evening prayers; but before the people departed, theMoor who had acted as interpreter informed me that Ali was about topresent me with something to eat; and looking round, I observed some boysbringing a wild hog, which they tied to one of the tent strings, and Alimade signs to me to kill and dress it for supper.  Though I was veryhungry, I did not think it prudent to eat any part of an animal so muchdetested by the Moors, and therefore told him that I never ate such food.They then untied the hog, in hopes that it would run immediately atme—for they believe that a great enmity subsists between hogs andChristians—but in this they were disappointed, for the animal no soonerregained his liberty than he began to attack indiscriminately everyperson that came in his way, and at last took shelter under the couchupon which the king was sitting.  The assembly being thus dissolved, Iwas conducted to the tent of Ali’s chief slave, but was not permitted toenter, nor allowed to touch anything belonging to it.  I requestedsomething to eat, and a little boiled corn, with salt and water, was atlength sent me in a wooden bowl; and a mat was spread upon the sandbefore the tent, on which I passed the night, surrounded by the curiousmultitude.</p><p> </p><p> At sunrise, Ali, with a few attendants, came on horseback to visit me,and signified that he had provided a hut for me, where I would besheltered from the sun.  I was accordingly conducted thither, and foundthe hut comparatively cool and pleasant.</p><p> </p><p> I was no sooner seated in this my new habitation than the Moors assembledin crowds to behold me; but I found it rather a troublesome levée, for Iwas obliged to take off one of my stockings, and show them my foot, andeven to take off my jacket and waistcoat, to show them how my clotheswere put on and off; they were much delighted with the curiouscontrivance of buttons.  All this was to be repeated to every succeedingvisitor; for such as had already seen these wonders insisted on theirfriends seeing the same; and in this manner I was employed, dressing andundressing, buttoning and unbuttoning, from noon till night.  About eighto’clock, Ali sent me for supper some kouskous and salt and water, whichwas very acceptable, being the only victuals I had tasted since morning.</p><p> </p><p> I observed that in the night the Moors kept regular watch, and frequentlylooked into the hut to see if I was asleep; and if it was quite dark,they would light a wisp of grass.  About two o’clock in the morning aMoor entered the hut, probably with a view to steal something, or perhapsto murder me; and groping about he laid his hand upon my shoulder.  Asnight visitors were at best but suspicious characters, I sprang up themoment he laid his hand upon me; and the Moor, in his haste to get off,stumbled over my boy, and fell with his face upon the wild hog, whichreturned the attack by biting the Moor’s arm.  The screams of this manalarmed the people in the king’s tent, who immediately conjectured that Ihad made my escape, and a number of them mounted their horses, andprepared to pursue me.  I observed upon this occasion that Ali did notsleep in his own tent, but came galloping upon a white horse from a smalltent at a considerable distance; indeed, the tyrannical and cruelbehaviour of this man made him so jealous of every person around him thateven his own slaves and domestics knew not where he slept.  When theMoors had explained to him the cause of this outcry they all went away,and I was permitted to sleep quietly until morning.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 13.—With the returning day commenced the same round of insult andirritation—the boys assembled to beat the hog, and the men and women toplague the Christian.  It is impossible for me to describe the behaviourof a people who study mischief as a science, and exult in the miseriesand misfortunes of their fellow-creatures.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER X.A MOORISH WEDDING.</p><p> </p><p> THE Moors, though very indolent themselves, are rigid task-masters, andkeep every person under them in full employment.  My boy Demba was sentto the woods to collect withered grass for Ali’s horses; and after avariety of projects concerning myself, they at last found out anemployment for me: this was no other than the respectable office of_barber_.  I was to make my first exhibition in this capacity in theroyal presence, and to be honoured with the task of shaving the head ofthe young prince of Ludamar.  I accordingly seated myself upon the sand,and the boy, with some hesitation, sat down beside me.  A small razor,about three inclines long, was put into my hand, and I was ordered toproceed; but whether from my own want of skill, or the improper shape ofthe instrument, I unfortunately made a slight incision in the boy’s headat the very commencement of the operation; and the king, observing theawkward manner in which I held the razor, concluded that his son’s headwas in very improper hands, and ordered me to resign the razor and walkout of the tent.  This I considered as a very fortunate circumstance; forI had laid it down as a rule to make myself as useless and insignificantas possible, as the only means of recovering my liberty.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 18.—Four Moors arrived from Jarra with Johnson my interpreter,having seized him before he had received any intimation of myconfinement, and bringing with them a bundle of clothes that I had leftat Daman Jumma’s house, for my use in case I should return by the way ofJarra.  Johnson was led into Ali’s tent and examined; the bundle wasopened, and I was sent for to explain the use of the different articles.I was happy, however, to find that Johnson had committed my papers to thecharge of one of Daman’s wives.  When I had satisfied Ali’s curiosityrespecting the different articles of apparel the bundle was again tiedup, and put into a large cow-skin bag that stood in a corner of the tent.The same evening Ali sent three of his people to inform me that therewere many thieves in the neighbourhood, and that to prevent the rest ofmy things from being stolen it was necessary to convey them all into histent.  My clothes, instruments, and everything that belonged to me, wereaccordingly carried away; and though the heat and dust made clean linenvery necessary and refreshing, I could not procure a single shirt out ofthe small stock I had brought along with me.  Ali was, however,disappointed by not finding among my effects the quantity of gold andamber that he expected; but to make sure of everything he sent the samepeople, on the morning following, to examine whether I had anythingconcealed about my person.  They, with their usual rudeness, searchedevery part of my apparel, and stripped me of all my gold, amber, mywatch, and one of my pocket-compasses; I had, fortunately, in the night,buried the other compass in the sand—and this, with the clothes I had on,was all that the tyranny of Ali had now left me.</p><p> </p><p> The gold and amber were highly gratifying to Moorish avarice, but thepocket-compass soon became an object of superstitious curiosity.  Ali wasvery desirous to be informed why that small piece of iron, the needle,always pointed to the Great Desert; and I found myself somewhat puzzledto answer the question.  To have pleaded my ignorance would have createda suspicion that I wished to conceal the real truth from him; I thereforetold him that my mother resided far beyond the sands of Sahara, and thatwhilst she was alive the piece of iron would always point that way, andserve as a guide to conduct me to her, and that if she was dead it wouldpoint to her grave.  Ali now looked at the compass with redoubledamazement; turned it round and round repeatedly; but observing that italways pointed the same way, he took it up with great caution andreturned it to me, manifesting that he thought there was something ofmagic in it, and that he was afraid of keeping so dangerous an instrumentin his possession.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 20.—This morning a council of chief men was held in Ali’s tentrespecting me.  Their decisions, though they were all unfavourable to me,were differently related by different persons.  Some said that theyintended to put me to death; others that I was only to lose my righthand; but the most probable account was that which I received from Ali’sown son, a boy about nine years of age, who came to me in the evening,and, with much concern, informed me that his uncle had persuaded hisfather to put out my eyes, which they said resembled those of a cat, andthat all the bushreens had approved of this measure.  His father,however, he said, would not put the sentence into execution until Fatima,the queen, who was at present in the north, had seen me.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 21.—Anxious to know my destiny, I went to the king early in themorning; and as a number of bushreens were assembled, I thought this afavourable opportunity of discovering their intentions.  I thereforebegan by begging his permission to return to Jarra, which was flatlyrefused.  His wife, he said, had not yet seen me, and I must stay untilshe came to Benowm, after which I should be at liberty to depart; andthat my horse, which had been taken away from me the day after I arrived,should be again restored to me.  Unsatisfactory as this answer was, I wasforced to appear pleased; and as there was little hope of making myescape at this season of the year, on account of the excessive heat, andthe total want of water in the woods, I resolved to wait patiently untilthe rains had set in, or until some more favourable opportunity shouldpresent itself.  But “hope deferred maketh the heart sick.”  This tediousprocrastination from day to day, and the thoughts of travelling throughthe negro kingdoms in the rainy season, which was now fast approaching,made me very melancholy; and having passed a restless night, I foundmyself attacked in the morning by a smart fever.  I had wrapped myselfclose up in my cloak with a view to induce perspiration, and was asleep,when a party of Moors entered the hut, and with their usual rudenesspulled the cloak from me.  I made signs to them that I was sick, andwished much to sleep, but I solicited in vain; my distress was matter ofsport to them, and they endeavoured to heighten it by every means intheir power.  In this perplexity I left my hut, and walked to some shadytrees at a little distance from the camp, where I lay down.  But evenhere persecution followed me, and solitude was thought too great anindulgence for a distressed Christian.  Ali’s son, with a number ofhorsemen, came galloping to the place, and ordered me to rise and followthem.  I begged they would allow me to remain where I was, if it was onlyfor a few hours; but they paid little attention to what I said, and,after a few threatening words, one of them pulled out a pistol from aleather bag that was fastened to the pommel of his saddle, and presentingit towards me, snapped it twice.  He did this with so much indifference,that I really doubted whether the pistol was loaded.  He cocked it athird time, and was striking the flint with a piece of steel, when Ibegged them to desist, and returned with them to the camp.  When weentered Ali’s tent we found him much out of humour.  He called for theMoor’s pistol, and amused himself for some time with opening and shuttingthe pan; at length taking up his powder-horn, he fresh primed it, and,turning round to me with a menacing look, said something in Arabic whichI did not understand.  I desired my boy, who was sitting before the tent,to inquire what offence I had committed; when I was informed, that havinggone out of the camp without Ali’s permission, they suspected that I hadsome design of making my escape; and that, in future, if I was seenwithout the skirts of the camp, orders had been given that I should beshot by the first person that observed me.</p><p> </p><p> In the afternoon the horizon to the eastward was thick and hazy, and theMoors prognosticated a sand wind, which accordingly commenced on themorning following, and lasted, with slight intermissions, for two days.The force of the wind was not in itself very great; it was what a seamanwould have denominated a _stiff breeze_; but the quantity of sand anddust carried before it was such as to darken the whole atmosphere.</p><p> </p><p> About this time all the women of the camp had their feet and the ends oftheir fingers stained of a dark saffron colour.  I could never ascertainwhether this was done from motives of religion, or by way of ornament.</p><p> </p><p> _March_ 28.—This morning a large herd of cattle arrived from theeastward, and one of the drivers, to whom Ali had lent my horse, cameinto my hut with the leg of an antelope as a present, and told me that myhorse was standing before Ali’s tent.  In a little time Ali sent one ofhis slaves to inform me that in the afternoon I must be in readiness toride out with him, as he intended to show me to some of his women.</p><p> </p><p> About four o’clock, Ali, with six of his courtiers, came riding to myhut, and told me to follow them.  I readily complied.  But here a newdifficulty occurred.  The Moors, accustomed to a loose and easy dress,could not reconcile themselves to the appearance of my _nankeenbreeches_, which they said were not only inelegant, but, on account oftheir tightness, very indecent; and as this was a visit to ladies, Aliordered my boy to bring out the loose cloak which I had always worn sincemy arrival at Benowm, and told me to wrap it close round me.  We visitedthe tents of four different ladies, at every one of which I was presentedwith a bowl of milk and water.  All these ladies were remarkablycorpulent, which is considered here as the highest mark of beauty.  Theywere very inquisitive, and examined my hair and skin with greatattention, but affected to consider me as a sort of inferior being tothemselves, and would knit their brows, and seem to shudder when theylooked at the whiteness of my skin.</p><p> </p><p> The Moors are certainly very good horsemen.  They ride without fear—theirsaddles being high before and behind, afford them a very secure seat; andif they chance to fall, the whole country is so soft and sandy that theyare very seldom hurt.  Their greatest pride, and one of their principalamusements, is to put the horse to its full speed, and then stop him witha sudden jerk, so as frequently to bring him down upon his haunches.  Alialways rode upon a milk-white horse, with its tail dyed red.  He neverwalked, unless when he went to say his prayers; and even in the night twoor three horses were always kept ready saddled at a little distance fromhis own tent.  The Moors set a very high value upon their horses; for itis by their superior fleetness that they are enabled to make so manypredatory excursions into the negro countries.  They feed them three orfour times a day, and generally give them a large quantity of sweet milkin the evening, which the horses appear to relish very much.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 3.—This forenoon, a child, which had been some time sickly, diedin the next tent; and the mother and relations immediately began thedeath-howl.  They were joined by a number of female visitors, who came onpurpose to assist at this melancholy concert.  I had no opportunity ofseeing the burial, which is generally performed secretly, in the dusk ofthe evening, and frequently at only a few yards’ distance from the tent.Over the grave they plant one particular shrub, and no stranger isallowed to pluck a leaf, or even to touch it—so great a veneration havethey for the dead.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 7.—About four o’clock in the afternoon a whirlwind passed throughthe camp with such violence that it overturned three tents, and blew downone side of my hut.  These whirlwinds come from the Great Desert, and atthis season of the year are so common that I have seen five or six ofthem at one time.  They carry up quantities of sand to an amazing height,which resemble, at a distance, so many moving pillars of smoke.</p><p> </p><p> The scorching heat of the sun, upon a dry and sandy country, makes theair insufferably hot.  Ali having robbed me of my thermometer, I had nomeans of forming a comparative judgment; but in the middle of the day,when the beams of the vertical sun are seconded by the scorching windfrom the desert, the ground is frequently heated to such a degree as notto be borne by the naked foot.  Even the negro slaves will not run fromone tent to another without their sandals.  At this time of the day theMoors lie stretched at length in their tents, either asleep, or unwillingto move; and I have often felt the wind so hot, that I could not hold myhand in the current of air which came through the crevices of my hutwithout feeling sensible pain.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 8.—This day the wind blew from the south-west; and in the nightthere was a heavy shower of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 10.—In the evening the _tabala_, or large drum, was beat toannounce a wedding, which was held at one of the neighbouring tents.  Agreat number of people of both sexes assembled, but without that mirthand hilarity which take place at a negro wedding.  Here was neithersinging nor dancing, nor any other amusement that I could perceive.  Awoman was beating the drum, and the other women joining at times like achorus, by setting up a shrill scream, and at the same time moving theirtongues from one side of the mouth to the other with great celerity.  Iwas soon tired, and had returned into my hut, where I was sitting almostasleep, when an old woman entered with a wooden bowl in her hand, andsignified that she had brought me a present from the bride.  Before Icould recover from the surprise which this message created, the womandischarged the contents of the bowl full in my face.  Finding that it wasthe same sort of holy water with which, among the Hottentots, a priest issaid to sprinkle a newly-married couple, I began to suspect that the oldlady was actuated by mischief or malice; but she gave me seriously tounderstand that it was a nuptial benediction from the bride’s own person,and which, on such occasions, is always received by the young unmarriedMoors as a mark of distinguished favour.  This being the case, I wiped myface, and sent my acknowledgments to the lady.  The wedding drumcontinued to beat, and the women to sing, or rather whistle, all night.About nine in the morning the bride was brought in state from hermother’s tent, attended by a number of women who carried her tent (apresent from the husband), some bearing up the poles, others holding bythe strings; and in this manner they marched, whistling as formerly,until they came to the place appointed for her residence, where theypitched the tent.  The husband followed, with a number of men, leadingfour bullocks, which they tied to the tent strings; and having killedanother, and distributed the beef among the people, the ceremony wasconcluded.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XI.SUFFERINGS IN CAPTIVITY.</p><p> </p><p> ONE whole month had now elapsed since I was led into captivity, duringwhich time each returning day brought me fresh distresses.  I watched thelingering course of the sun with anxiety, and blessed his evening beamsas they shined a yellow lustre along the sandy floor of my hut; for itwas then that my oppressors left me, and allowed me to pass the sultrynight in solitude and reflection.</p><p> </p><p> About midnight a bowl of kouskous, with some salt and water, were broughtfor me and my two attendants.  This was our common fare, and it was allthat was allowed us to allay the cravings of hunger and support naturefor the whole of the following day; for it is to be observed that thiswas the Mohammedan Lent, and as the Moors keep the fast with a religiousstrictness, they thought it proper to compel me, though a Christian, tosimilar observance.  Time, however, somewhat reconciled me to mysituation.  I found that I could bear hunger and thirst better than Iexpected; and at length I endeavoured to beguile the tedious hours bylearning to write Arabic.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 14.—As Queen Fatima had not yet arrived, Ali proposed to go tothe north and bring her back with him; but as the place was two days’journey from Benowm it was necessary to have some refreshment on theroad; and Ali, suspicious of those about him, was so afraid of beingpoisoned, that he never ate anything but what was dressed under his ownimmediate inspection.  A fine bullock was therefore killed, and the fleshbeing cut up into thin slices, was dried in the sun; and this, with twobags of dry kouskous, formed his travelling provisions.</p><p> </p><p> Previous to his departure, the black people of the town of Benowm came,according to their annual custom, to show their arms, and bring theirstipulated tribute of corn and cloth.  They were but badlyarmed—twenty-two with muskets, forty or fifty with bows and arrows, andnearly the same number of men and boys with spears only.  They arrangedthemselves before the tent, where they waited until their arms wereexamined, and some little disputes settled.</p><p> </p><p> About midnight on the 16th, Ali departed quietly from Benowm, accompaniedby a few attendants.  He was expected to return in the course of nine orten days.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 18.—Two days after the departure of Ali a shereef arrived withsalt and some other articles from Walet, the capital of the kingdom ofBiroo.  As there was no tent appropriated for him, he took up his abodein the same hut with me.  He seemed to be a well-informed man, and hisacquaintance both with the Arabic and Bambarra tongues enabled him totravel with ease and safety through a number of kingdoms; for though hisplace of residence was Walet, he had visited Houssa, and had lived someyears at Timbuctoo.  Upon my inquiring so particularly about the distancefrom Walet to Timbuctoo, he asked me if I intended to travel that way;and being answered in the affirmative, he shook his head, and said itwould not do; for that Christians were looked upon there as the devil’schildren, and enemies to the Prophet.  From him I learned the followingparticulars:—That Houssa was the largest town he had ever seen: thatWalet was larger than Timbuctoo, but being remote from the Niger, and itstrade consisting chiefly of salt, it was not so much resorted to bystrangers: that between Benowm and Walet was ten days’ journey; but theroad did not lead through any remarkable towns, and travellers supportedthemselves by purchasing milk from the Arabs, who keep their herds by thewatering-places: two of the days’ journeys was over a sandy country,without water.  From Walet to Timbuctoo was eleven days more; but waterwas more plentiful, and the journey was usually performed upon bullocks.He said there were many Jews at Timbuctoo, but they all spoke Arabic, andused the same prayers as the Moors.  He frequently pointed his hand tothe south-east quarter, or rather the east by south, observing thatTimbuctoo was situated in that direction; and though I made him repeatthis information again and again, I never found him to vary more thanhalf a point, which was to the southward.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 24.—This morning Shereef Sidi Mahomed Moora Abdalla, a native ofMorocco, arrived with five bullocks loaded with salt.  He had formerlyresided some months at Gibraltar, where he had picked up as much Englishas enabled him to make himself understood.  He informed me that he hadbeen five months in coming from Santa Cruz; but that great part of thetime had been spent in trading.  When I requested him to enumerate thedays employed in travelling from Morocco to Benowm, he gave them asfollows: To Swera, three days; to Agadier, three; to Jinikin, ten; toWadenoon, four; to Lakeneig, five; to Zeeriwin-zerimani, five; toTisheet, ten; to Benowm, ten—in all, fifty days: but travellers usuallyrest a long while at Jinikin and Tisheet—at the latter of which placesthey dig the rock salt, which is so great an article of commerce with thenegroes.</p><p> </p><p> In conversing with these shereefs, and the different strangers thatresorted to the camp, I passed my time with rather less uneasiness thanformerly.  On the other hand, as the dressing of my victuals was now leftentirely to the care of Ali’s slaves, over whom I had not the smallestcontrol, I found myself but ill supplied, worse even than in the fastmonth: for two successive nights they neglected to send us our accustomedmeal; and though my boy went to a small negro town near the camp, andbegged with great diligence from hut to hut, he could only procure a fewhandfuls of ground nuts, which he readily shared with me.</p><p> </p><p> We had been for some days in daily expectation of Ali’s return fromSaheel (or the north country) with his wife Fatima.  In the meanwhile,Mansong, king of Bambarra, as I have related in Chapter VIII., had sentto Ali for a party of horse to assist in storming Gedingooma.  With thisdemand Ali had not only refused to comply, but had treated the messengerswith great haughtiness and contempt; upon which Mansong gave up allthoughts of taking the town, and prepared to chastise Ali for hiscontumacy.</p><p> </p><p> Things were in this situation when, on the 29th of April, a messengerarrived at Benowm with the disagreeable intelligence that the Bambarraarmy was approaching the frontiers of Ludamar.  This threw the wholecountry into confusion, and in the afternoon Ali’s son, with about twentyhorsemen, arrived at Benowm.  He ordered all the cattle to be driven awayimmediately, all the tents to be struck, and the people to holdthemselves in readiness to depart at daylight the next morning.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 30.—At daybreak the whole camp was in motion.  The baggage wascarried upon bullocks—the two tent poles being placed one on each side,and the different wooden articles of the tent distributed in like manner;the tent cloth was thrown over all, and upon this was commonly placed oneor two women; for the Moorish women are very bad walkers.  The king’sfavourite concubines rode upon camels, with a saddle of a particularconstruction, and a canopy to shelter them from the sun.  We proceeded tothe northward until noon, when the king’s son ordered the whole company,except the tents, to enter a thick low wood which was upon our right.  Iwas sent along with the two tents, and arrived in the evening at a negrotown called Farani: here we pitched the tents in an open place at nogreat distance from the town.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 1.—As I had some reason to suspect that this day was also to beconsidered as a fast, I went in the morning to the negro town of Farani,and begged some provisions from the dooty, who readily supplied my wants,and desired me to come to his house every day during my stay in theneighbourhood.—These hospitable people are looked upon by the Moors as anabject race of slaves, and are treated accordingly.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 3.—We departed from the vicinity of Farani, and after a circuitousroute through the woods, arrived at Ali’s camp in the afternoon.  Thisencampment was larger than that of Benowm, and was situated un the middleof a thick wood, about two miles distant from a negro town calledBubaker.  I immediately waited upon Ali, in order to pay my respects toQueen Fatima, who had come with him from Saheel.  He seemed much pleasedwith my coming, shook hands with me, and informed his wife that I was theChristian.  She was a woman of the Arab caste, with long black hair, andremarkably corpulent.  She appeared at first rather shocked at thethought of having a Christian so near her; but when I had, by means of anegro boy who spoke the Mandingo and Arabic tongues, answered a greatmany questions which her curiosity suggested respecting the country ofthe Christians, she seemed more at ease, and presented me with a bowl ofmilk, which I considered as a very favourable omen.</p><p> </p><p> The heat was now almost insufferable—all nature seemed sinking under it.The distant country presented to the eye a dreary expanse of sand, with afew stunted trees and prickly bushes, in the shade of which the hungrycattle licked up the withered grass, while the camels and goats pickedoff the scanty foliage.  The scarcity of water was greater here than atBenowm.  Day and night the wells were crowded with cattle, lowing andfighting with each other to come at the troughs.  Excessive thirst mademany of them furious; others, being too weak to contend for the water,endeavoured to quench their thirst by devouring the black mud from thegutters near the wells, which they did with great avidity, though it wascommonly fatal to them.</p><p> </p><p> One night, having solicited in vain for water at the camp, and been quitefeverish, I resolved to try my fortune at the wells, which were abouthalf a mile distant from the camp.  Accordingly I set out about midnight,and being guided by the lowing of the cattle, soon arrived at the place,where I found the Moors very busy drawing water.  I requested permissionto drink, but was driven away with outrageous abuse.  Passing, however,from one well to another, I came at last to one where there was only anold man and two boys.  I made the same request to this man, and heimmediately drew me up a bucket of water; but, as I was about to takehold of it, he recollected that I was a Christian, and fearing that hisbucket might be polluted by my lips, he dashed the water into the trough,and told me to drink from thence.  Though this trough was none of thelargest, and three cows were already drinking from it, I resolved to comein for my share; and kneeling down thrust my head between two of thecows, and drank with great pleasure until the water was nearly exhausted,and the cows began to contend with each other for the last mouthful.</p><p> </p><p> In adventures of this nature I passed the sultry month of May, duringwhich no material change took place in my situation.  Ali stillconsidered me as a lawful prisoner; and Fatima, though she allowed me alarger quantity of victuals than I had been accustomed to receive atBenowm, had as yet said nothing on the subject of my release.  In themeantime, the frequent changes of the wind, the gathering clouds, anddistant lightning, with other appearances of approaching rain, indicatedthat the wet season was at hand, when the Moors annually evacuate thecountry of the negroes, and return to the skirts of the Great Desert.This made me consider that my fate was drawing towards a crisis, and Iresolved to wait for the event without any seeming uneasiness; butcircumstances occurred which produced a change in my favour more suddenlythan I had foreseen, or had reason to expect.  The case was this:—Thefugitive Kaartans, who had taken refuge in Ludamar, as I have related inChapter VIII., finding that the Moors were about to leave them, anddreading the resentment of their own sovereign, whom they had so baselydeserted, offered to treat with Ali for two hundred Moorish horsemen, toco-operate with them in an effort to expel Daisy from Gedingooma; foruntil Daisy should be vanquished or humbled they considered that theycould neither return to their native towns nor live in security in any ofthe neighbouring kingdoms.  With a view to extort money from these peopleby means of this treaty, Ali despatched his son to Jarra, and prepared tofollow him in the course of a few days.  This was an opportunity of toogreat consequence to me to be neglected.  I immediately applied toFatima, who, I found, had the chief direction in all affairs of state,and begged her interest with Ali to give me permission to accompany himto Jarra.  This request, after some hesitation, was favourably received.Fatima looked kindly on me, and, I believe, was at length moved withcompassion towards me.  My bundles were brought from the large cow-skinbag that stood in the corner of Ali’s tent, and I was ordered to explainthe use of the different articles, and show the method of putting on theboots, stockings, &c.—with all which I cheerfully complied, and was toldthat in the course of a few days I should be at liberty to depart.</p><p> </p><p> Believing, therefore, that I should certainly find the means of escapingfrom Jarra, if I should once get thither, I now freely indulged thepleasing hope that my captivity would soon terminate; and happily nothaving been disappointed in this idea, I shall pause in this place tocollect and bring into one point of view such observations on the Moorishcharacter and country as I had no fair opportunity of introducing intothe preceding narrative.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XII.OBSERVATIONS ON THE CHARACTER AND COUNTRY OF THE MOORS.</p><p> </p><p> THE Moors of this part of Africa are divided into many separate tribes,of which the most formidable, according to what was reported to me, arethose of Trasart and Il Braken, which inhabit the northern bank of theSenegal river.  The tribes of Gedumah, Jaffnoo, and Ludamar, though notso numerous as the former, are nevertheless very powerful and warlike,and are each governed by a chief, or king, who exercises absolutejurisdiction over his own horde, without acknowledging allegiance to acommon sovereign.  In time of peace the employment of the people ispasturage.  The Moors, indeed, subsist chiefly on the flesh of theircattle, and are always in the extreme of either gluttony or abstinence.In consequence of the frequent and severe fasts which their religionenjoins, and the toilsome journeys which they sometimes undertake acrossthe desert, they are enabled to bear both hunger and thirst withsurprising fortitude; but whenever opportunities occur of satisfyingtheir appetite they generally devour more at one meal than would serve aEuropean for three.  They pay but little attention to agriculture,purchasing their corn, cotton, cloth, and other necessaries from thenegroes, in exchange for salt, which they dig from the pits in the GreatDesert.</p><p> </p><p> The natural barrenness of the country is such that it furnishes but fewmaterials for manufacture.  The Moors, however, contrive to weave astrong cloth, with which they cover their tents; the thread is spun bytheir women from the hair of goats, and they prepare the hides of theircattle so as to furnish saddles, bridles, pouches, and other articles ofleather.  They are likewise sufficiently skilful to convert the nativeiron, which they procure from the negroes, into spears and knives, andalso into pots for boiling their food; but their sabres, and otherweapons, as well as their firearms and ammunition, they purchase from theEuropeans, in exchange for the negro slaves which they obtain in theirpredatory excursions.  Their chief commerce of this kind is with theFrench traders on the Senegal river.</p><p> </p><p> The Moors are rigid Mohammedans, and possess, with the bigotry andsuperstition, all the intolerance of their sect.  They have no mosques atBenowm, but perform their devotions in a sort of open shed, or enclosure,made of mats.  The priest is, at the same time, schoolmaster to thejuniors.  His pupils assemble every evening before his tent; where, bythe light of a large fire, made of brushwood and cow’s dung, they aretaught a few sentences from the Koran, and are initiated into theprinciples of their creed.  Their alphabet differs but little from thatin Richardson’s Arabic Grammar.  They always write with the vowel points.Their priests even affect to know something of foreign literature.  Thepriest of Benowm assured me that he could read the writings of theChristians: he showed me a number of barbarous characters, which heasserted were the Roman alphabet; and he produced another specimen,equally unintelligible, which he declared to be the _Kallam il Indi_, orPersian.  His library consisted of nine volumes in quarto; most of them,I believe, were books of religion—for the name of Mohammed appeared inred letters in almost every page of each.  His scholars wrote theirlessons upon thin boards, paper being too expensive for general use.  Theboys were diligent enough, and appeared to possess a considerable shareof emulation—carrying their boards slung over their shoulders when abouttheir common employments.  When a boy has committed to memory a few oftheir prayers, and can read and write certain parts of the Koran, he isreckoned sufficiently instructed; and with this slender stock of learningcommences his career of life.  Proud of his acquirements, he surveys withcontempt the unlettered negro; and embraces every opportunity ofdisplaying his superiority over such of his countrymen as are notdistinguished by the same accomplishments.</p><p> </p><p> The education of the girls is neglected altogether: mentalaccomplishments are but little attended to by the women; nor is the wantof them considered by the men as a defect in the female character.  Theyare regarded, I believe, as an inferior species of animals; and seem tobe brought up for no other purpose than that of administering to thesensual pleasures of their imperious masters.  Voluptuousness istherefore considered as their chief accomplishment, and slavishsubmission as their indispensable duty.</p><p> </p><p> The Moors have singular ideas of feminine perfection.  The gracefulnessof figure and motion, and a countenance enlivened by expression, are byno means essential points in their standard.  With them corpulence andbeauty appear to be terms nearly synonymous.  A woman of even moderatepretensions must be one who cannot walk without a slave under each arm tosupport her; and a perfect beauty is a load for a camel.  In consequenceof this prevalent taste for unwieldiness of bulk, the Moorish ladies takegreat pains to acquire it early in life; and for this purpose many of theyoung girls are compelled by their mothers to devour a great quantity ofkouskous, and drink a large bowl of camel’s milk every morning.  It is ofno importance whether the girl has an appetite or not; the kouskous andmilk must be swallowed, and obedience is frequently enforced by blows.  Ihave seen a poor girl sit crying, with the bowl at her lips, for morethan an hour, and her mother, with a stick in her hand, watching her allthe while, and using the stick without mercy whenever she observed thather daughter was not swallowing.  This singular practice, instead ofproducing indigestion and disease, soon covers the young lady with thatdegree of plumpness which, in the eye of a Moor, is perfection itself.</p><p> </p><p> As the Moors purchase all their clothing from the negroes, the women areforced to be very economical in the article of dress.  In general theycontent themselves with a broad piece of cotton cloth, which is wrappedround the middle, and hangs down like a petticoat almost to the ground.To the upper part of this are sewed two square pieces, one before, andthe other behind, which are fastened together over the shoulders.  Thehead-dress is commonly a bandage of cotton cloth, with some parts of itbroader than others, which serve to conceal the face when they walk inthe sun.  Frequently, however, when they go abroad, they veil themselvesfrom head to foot.</p><p> </p><p> The employment of the women varies according to their degrees ofopulence.  Queen Fatima, and a few others of high rank, like the greatladies in some parts of Europe, pass their time chiefly in conversingwith their visitors, performing their devotions, or admiring their charmsin a looking-glass.  The women of inferior class employ themselves indifferent domestic duties.  They are very vain and talkative; and whenanything puts them out of humour they commonly vent their anger upontheir female slaves, over whom they rule with severe and despoticauthority, which leads me to observe that the condition of these poorcaptives is deplorably wretched.  At daybreak they are compelled to fetchwater from the wells in large skins, called _girbas_; and as soon as theyhave brought water enough to serve the family for the day, as well as thehorses (for the Moors seldom give their horses the trouble of going tothe wells), they are then employed in pounding the corn and dressing thevictuals.  This being always done in the open air, the slaves are exposedto the combined heat of the sun, the sand, and the fire.  In theintervals it is their business to sweep the tent, churn the milk, andperform other domestic offices.  With all this they are badly fed, andoftentimes cruelly punished.</p><p> </p><p> The men’s dress, among the Moors of Ludamar, differs but little from thatof the negroes, which has been already described, except that they haveall adopted that characteristic of the Mohammedan sect, the turban, whichis here universally made of white cotton cloth.  Such of the Moors ashave long beards display them with a mixture of pride and satisfaction,as denoting an Arab ancestry.  Of this number was Ali himself; but amongthe generality of the people the hair is short and busy, and universallyblack.  And here I may be permitted to observe, that if any onecircumstance excited among them favourable thoughts towards my ownperson, it was my beard, which was now grown to an enormous length, andwas always beheld with approbation or envy.  I believe, in my conscience,they thought it too good a beard for a Christian.</p><p> </p><p> The only diseases which I observed to prevail among the Moors were theintermittent fever and dysentery—for the cure of which nostrums aresometimes administered by their old women, but in general nature is leftto her own operations.  Mention was made to me of the small-pox as beingsometimes very destructive; but it had not, to my knowledge, made itsappearance in Ludamar while I was in captivity.  That it prevails,however, among some tribes of the Moors, and that it is frequentlyconveyed by them to the negroes in the southern states, I was assured onthe authority of Dr. Laidley, who also informed me that the negroes onthe Gambia practise inoculation.</p><p> </p><p> The administration of criminal justice, as far as I had opportunities ofobserving, was prompt and decisive: for although civil rights were butlittle regarded in Ludamar, it was necessary when crimes were committedthat examples should sometimes be made.  On such occasions the offenderwas brought before Ali, who pronounced, of his sole authority, whatjudgment he thought proper.  But I understood that capital punishment wasseldom or never inflicted, except on the negroes.</p><p> </p><p> Although the wealth of the Moors consists chiefly in their numerous herdsof cattle, yet, as the pastoral life does not afford full employment, themajority of the people are perfectly idle, and spend the day in triflingconversation about their horses, or in laying schemes of depredation onthe negro villages.</p><p> </p><p> Of the number of Ali’s Moorish subjects I had no means of forming acorrect estimate.  The military strength of Ludamar consists in cavalry.They are well mounted, and appear to be very expert in skirmishing andattacking by surprise.  Every soldier furnishes his own horse, and findshis accoutrements, consisting of a large sabre, a double-barrelled gun, asmall red leather bag for holding his balls, and a powder bag slung overthe shoulder.  He has no pay, nor any remuneration but what arises fromplunder.  This body is not very numerous; for when Ali made war uponBambarra I was informed that his whole force did not exceed two thousandcavalry.  They constitute, however, by what I could learn, but a verysmall proportion of his Moorish subjects.  The horses are very beautiful,and so highly esteemed that the negro princes will sometimes give fromtwelve to fourteen slaves for one horse.</p><p> </p><p> Ludamar has for its northern boundary the great desert of Sahara.  Fromthe best inquiries I could make, this vast ocean of sand, which occupiesso large a space in northern Africa, may be pronounced almost destituteof inhabitants, except where the scanty vegetation which appears incertain spots affords pasturage for the flocks of a few miserable Arabs,who wander from one well to another.  In other places, where the supplyof water and pasturage is more abundant, small parties of the Moors havetaken up their residence.  Here they live, in independent poverty, securefrom the tyrannical government of Barbary.  But the greater part of thedesert, being totally destitute of water, is seldom visited by any humanbeing, unless where the trading caravans trace out their toilsome anddangerous route across it.  In some parts of this extensive waste theground is covered with low stunted shrubs, which serve as landmarks forthe caravans, and furnish the camels with a scanty forage.  In otherparts the disconsolate wanderer, wherever he turns, sees nothing aroundhim but a vast interminable expanse of sand and sky—a gloomy and barrenvoid, where the eye finds no particular object to rest upon, and the mindis filled with painful apprehensions of perishing with thirst.</p><p> </p><p> The few wild animals which inhabit these melancholy regions are theantelope and the ostrich; their swiftness of foot enabling them to reachthe distant watering-places.  On the skirts of the desert, where water ismore plentiful, are found lions, panthers, elephants, and wild bears.</p><p> </p><p> Of domestic animals, the only one that can endure the fatigue of crossingthe desert is the camel.  By the particular conformation of the stomachhe is enabled to carry a supply of water sufficient for ten or twelvedays; his broad and yielding foot is well adapted for a sandy country;and, by a singular motion of his upper lip, he picks the smallest leavesfrom the thorny shrubs of the desert as he passes along.  The camel istherefore the only beast of burden employed by the trading caravans whichtraverse the desert in different directions, from Barbary to Nigritia.As this useful and docile creature has been sufficiently described bysystematical writers it is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon hisproperties.  I shall only add that his flesh, though to my own taste dryand unsavoury, is preferred by the Moors to any other; and that the milkof the female is in universal esteem, and is indeed sweet, pleasant, andnutritive.</p><p> </p><p> I have observed that the Moors, in their complexion, resemble themulattoes of the West Indies; but they have something unpleasant in theiraspect which the mulattoes have not.  I fancied that I discovered in thefeatures of most of them a disposition towards cruelty and low cunning;and I could never contemplate their physiognomy without feeling sensibleuneasiness.  From the staring wildness of their eyes a stranger wouldimmediately set them down as a nation of lunatics.  The treachery andmalevolence of their character are manifest in their plunderingexcursions against the negro villages.  Oftentimes without the smallestprovocation, and sometimes under the fairest professions of friendship,they will suddenly seize upon the negroes’ cattle, and even on theinhabitants themselves.  The negroes very seldom retaliate.</p><p> </p><p> Like the roving Arabs, the Moors frequently remove from one place toanother, according to the season of the year or the convenience ofpasturage.  In the month of February, when the heat of the sun scorchesup every sort of vegetation in the desert, they strike their tents andapproach the negro country to the south, where they reside until therains commence, in the month of July.  At this time, having purchasedcorn and other necessaries from the negroes, in exchange for salt, theyagain depart to the northward, and continue in the desert until the rainsare over, and that part of the country becomes burnt up and barren.</p><p> </p><p> This wandering and restless way of life, while it inures them tohardships, strengthens at the same time the bonds of their littlesociety, and creates in them an aversion towards strangers which isalmost insurmountable.  Cut off from all intercourse with civilisednations, and boasting an advantage over the negroes, by possessing,though in a very limited degree, the knowledge of letters, they are atonce the vainest and proudest, and perhaps the most bigoted, ferocious,and intolerant of all the nations on the earth—combining in theircharacter the blind superstition of the negro with the savage cruelty andtreachery of the Arab.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XIII.ESCAPE FROM CAPTIVITY.</p><p> </p><p> HAVING, as hath been related, obtained permission to accompany Ali toJarra, I took leave of Queen Fatima, who, with much grace and civility,returned me part of my apparel; and the evening before my departure, myhorse, with the saddle and bridle, were sent me by Ali’s order.</p><p> </p><p> Early on the morning of the 26th of May I departed from the camp ofBubaker, accompanied by my two attendants, Johnson and Demba, and anumber of Moors on horseback, Ali, with about fifty horsemen, having goneprivately from the camp during the night.  We stopped about noon atFarani, and were there joined by twelve Moors riding upon camels, andwith them we proceeded to a watering-place in the woods, where weovertook Ali and his fifty horsemen.  They were lodged in some lowshepherd’s tents near the wells.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 28.—Early in the morning the Moors saddled their horses, and Ali’schief slave ordered me to get in readiness.  In a little time the samemessenger returned, and, taking my boy by the shoulder, told him in theMandingo language, that “Ali was to be his master in future;” and thenturning to me, “The business is settled at last,” said he; “the boy, andeverything but your horse, goes back to Bubaker, but you may take the oldfool” (meaning Johnson the interpreter) “with you to Jarra.”   I made himno answer; but being shocked beyond description at the idea of losing thepoor boy, I hastened to Ali, who was at breakfast before his tent,surrounded by many of his courtiers.  I told him (perhaps in rather toopassionate a strain), that whatever imprudence I had been guilty of incoming into his country, I thought I had already been sufficientlypunished for it by being so long detained, and then plundered of all mylittle property; which, however, gave me no uneasiness when compared withwhat he had just now done to me.  I observed that the boy whom he had nowseized upon was not a slave, and had been accused of no offence; he was,indeed, one of my attendants, and his faithful services in that stationhad procured him his freedom.  His fidelity and attachment had made himfellow me into my present situation, and, as he looked up to me forprotection I could not see him deprived of his liberty withoutremonstrating against such an act as the height of cruelty and injustice.Ali made no reply, but, with a haughty air and malignant smile, told hisinterpreter that if I did not mount my horse immediately he would send meback likewise.  There is something in the frown of a tyrant which rousesthe most secret emotions of the heart: I could not suppress my feelings,and for once entertained an indignant wish to rid the world of such amonster.</p><p> </p><p> Poor Demba was not less affected than myself.  He had formed a strongattachment towards me, and had a cheerfulness of disposition which oftenbeguiled the tedious hours of captivity.  He was likewise a proficient inthe Bambarra tongue, and promised on that account to be of great utilityto me in future.  But it was in vain to expect anything favourable tohumanity from people who are strangers to its dictates.  So, havingshaken hands with this unfortunate boy, and blended my tears with his,assuring him, however, that I would do my utmost to redeem him, I saw himled off by three of Ali’s slaves towards the camp at Bubaker.</p><p> </p><p> When the Moors had mounted their horses I was ordered to follow them,and, after a toilsome journey through the woods in a very sultry day, wearrived in the afternoon at a walled village called Doombani, where weremained two days, waiting for the arrival of some horsemen from thenorthward.</p><p> </p><p> On the 1st of June we departed from Doombani towards Jarra.  Our companynow amounted to two hundred men, all on horseback, for the Moors neveruse infantry in their wars.  They appeared capable of enduring greatfatigue; but from their total want of discipline our journey to Jarra wasmore like a fox-chase than the march of an army.</p><p> </p><p> At Jarra I took up my lodging at the house of my old acquaintance, DamanJumma, and informed him of everything that had befallen me.  Iparticularly requested him to use his interest with Ali to redeem my boy,and promised him a bill upon Dr. Laidley for the value of two slaves themoment he brought him to Jarra.  Daman very readily undertook tonegotiate the business, but found that Ali considered the boy as myprincipal interpreter, and was unwilling to part with him, lest he shouldfall a second time into my hands, and be instrumental in conducting me toBambarra.  Ali, therefore, put off the matter from day to day, but withaltold Daman that if he wished to purchase the boy for himself he shouldhave him thereafter at the common price of a slave, which Daman agreed topay for him whenever Ali should send him to Jarra.</p><p> </p><p> The chief object of Ali, in this journey to Jarra, as I have alreadyrelated, was to procure money from such of the Kaartans as had takenrefuge in his country.  Some of these had solicited his protection toavoid the horrors of war, but by far the greatest number of them weredissatisfied men, who wished the ruin of their own sovereign.  Thesepeople no sooner heard that the Bambarra army had returned to Segowithout subduing Daisy, as was generally expected, than they resolved tomake a sudden attack themselves upon him before he could recruit hisforces, which were now known to be much diminished by a bloody campaign,and in great want of provisions.  With this view they solicited the Moorsto join them, and offered to hire of Ali two hundred horsemen, which Ali,with the warmest professions of friendship, agreed to furnish, uponcondition that they should previously supply him with four hundred headof cattle, two hundred garments of blue cloth, and a considerablequantity of beads and ornaments.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 8.—In the afternoon Ali sent his chief slave to inform me that hewas about to return to Bubaker: but as he would only stay there a fewdays to keep the approaching festival (_Banna selee_), and then return toJarra, I had permission to remain with Daman until his return.  This wasjoyful news to me; but I had experienced so many disappointments that Iwas unwilling to indulge the hope of its being true, until Johnson cameand told me that Ali, with part of the horsemen, were actually gone fromthe town, and that the rest were to follow him in the morning.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 9.—Early in the morning the remainder of the Moors departed fromthe town.  They had, during their stay, committed many acts of robbery;and this morning with the most unparalleled audacity, they seized uponthree girls who were bringing water from the wells, and carried them awayinto slavery.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 12.—Two people, dreadfully wounded, were discovered at awatering-place in the woods; one of them had just breathed his last, butthe other was brought alive to Jarra.  On recovering a little he informedthe people that he had fled through the woods from Kasson; that Daisy hadmade war upon Sambo, the king of that country; had surprised three of histowns, and put all the inhabitants to the sword.  He enumerated by namemany of the friends of the Jarra people who had been murdered in Kasson.This intelligence made the death-howl universal in Jarra for the space oftwo days.</p><p> </p><p> This piece of bad news was followed by another not less distressing.  Anumber of runaway slaves arrived from Kaarta on the 14th, and reportedthat Daisy, having received information concerning the intended attackupon him, was about to visit Jarra.  This made the negroes call upon Alifor the two hundred horsemen which he was to furnish them according toengagement.  But Ali paid very little attention to their remonstrances,and at last plainly told them that his cavalry were otherwise employed.The negroes, thus deserted by the Moors, and fully apprised that the kingof Kaarta would show them as little clemency as he had shown theinhabitants of Kasson, resolved to collect all their forces, and hazard abattle before the king, who was now in great distress for want ofprovisions, should become too powerful for them.  They thereforeassembled about eight hundred effective men in the whole, and with thesethey entered Kaarta on the evening of the 18th of June.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 19.—This morning the wind shifted to the south-west; and about twoo’clock in the afternoon we had a heavy tornado, or thunder-squall,accompanied with rain, which greatly revived the face of nature, and gavea pleasant coolness to the air.  This was the first rain that had fallenfor many months.</p><p> </p><p> As every attempt to redeem my boy had hitherto been unsuccessful, and inall probability would continue to prove so whilst I remained in thecountry, I found that it was necessary for me to come to somedetermination concerning my own safety before the rains should be fullyset in; for my landlord, seeing no likelihood of being paid for histrouble, began to wish me away—and Johnson, my interpreter, refusing toproceed, my situation became very perplexing.  I determined to availmyself of the first opportunity of escaping, and to proceed directly forBambarra, as soon as the rains had set in for a few days, so as to affordme the certainty of finding water in the woods.</p><p> </p><p> Such was my situation when, on the evening of the 24th of June, I wasstartled by the report of some muskets close to the town, and inquiringthe reason, was informed that the Jarra army had returned from fightingDaisy, and that this firing was by way of rejoicing.  However, when thechief men of the town had assembled, and heard a full detail of theexpedition, they were by no means relieved from their uneasiness onDaisy’s account.  The deceitful Moors having drawn back from theconfederacy, after being hired by the negroes, greatly dispirited theinsurgents, who, instead of finding Daisy with a few friends concealed inthe strong fortress of Gedingooma, had found him at a town near Joka, inthe open country, surrounded by so numerous an army that every attempt toattack him was at once given up; and the confederates only thought ofenriching themselves by the plunder of the small towns in theneighbourhood.  They accordingly fell upon one of Daisy’s towns, andcarried off the whole of the inhabitants; but lest intelligence of thismight reach Daisy, and induce him to cut off their retreat, they returnedthrough the woods by night bringing with them the slaves and cattle whichthey had captured.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 26.—This afternoon a spy from Kaarta brought the alarmingintelligence that Daisy had taken Simbing in the morning, and would be inJarra some time in the course of the ensuing day.  Early in the morningnearly one-half of the townspeople took the road for Bambarra, by the wayof Deena.</p><p> </p><p> Their departure was very affecting, the women and children crying, themen sullen and dejected, and all of them looking back with regret ontheir native town, and on the wells and rocks beyond which their ambitionhad never tempted them to stray, and where they had laid all their plansof future happiness, all of which they were now forced to abandon, and toseek shelter among strangers.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 27.—About eleven o’clock in the forenoon we were alarmed by thesentinels, who brought information that Daisy was on his march towardsJarra, and that the confederate army had fled before him without firing agun.  The terror of the townspeople on this occasion is not easily to bedescribed.  Indeed, the screams of the women and children, and the greathurry and confusion that everywhere prevailed, made me suspect that theKaartans had already entered the town; and although I had every reason tobe pleased with Daisy’s behaviour to me when I was at Kemmoo, I had nowish to expose myself to the mercy of his army, who might in the generalconfusion mistake me for a Moor.  I therefore mounted my horse, andtaking a large bag of corn before me, rode slowly along with thetownspeople, until we reached the foot of a rocky hill, where Idismounted and drove my horse up before me.  When I had reached thesummit I sat down, and having a full view of the town and theneighbouring country, could not help lamenting the situation of the poorinhabitants, who were thronging after me, driving their sheep, cows,goats, &c., and carrying a scanty portion of provisions and a fewclothes.  There was a great noise and crying everywhere upon the road,for many aged people and children were unable to walk, and these, withthe sick, were obliged to be carried, otherwise they must have been leftto certain destruction.</p><p> </p><p> About five o’clock we arrived at a small farm belonging to the Jarrapeople, called Kadeeja; and here I found Daman and Johnson employed infilling large bags of corn, to be carried upon bullocks, to serve asprovisions for Daman’s family on the road.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 28.—At daybreak we departed from Kadeeja, and having passedTroongoomba without stopping, arrived in the afternoon at Queira.  Iremained here two days, in order to recruit my horse, which the Moors hadreduced to a perfect Rosinante, and to wait for the arrival of someMandingo negroes, who were going for Bambarra in the course of a fewdays.</p><p> </p><p> On the afternoon of the 1st of July, as I was tending my horse in thefields, Ali’s chief slave and four Moors arrived at Queira, and took uptheir lodging at the dooty’s house.  My interpreter, Johnson, whosuspected the nature of this visit, sent two boys to overhear theirconversation, from which he learnt that they were sent to convey me backto Bubaker.  The same evening two of the Moors came privately to look atmy horse, and one of them proposed taking it to the dooty’s hut, but theother observed that such a precaution was unnecessary, as I could neverescape upon such an animal.  They then inquired where I slept, andreturned to their companions.</p><p> </p><p> All this was like a stroke of thunder to me, for I dreaded nothing somuch as confinement again among the Moors, from whose barbarity I hadnothing but death to expect.  I therefore determined to set offimmediately for Bambarra, a measure which I thought offered almost theonly chance of saving my life and gaining the object of my mission.  Icommunicated the design to Johnson, who, although he applauded myresolution, was so far from showing any inclination to accompany me, thathe solemnly protested he would rather forfeit his wages than go anyfarther.  He told me that Daman had agreed to give him half the price ofa slave for his service to assist in conducting a coffle of slaves toGambia, and that he was determined to embrace the opportunity ofreturning to his wife and family.</p><p> </p><p> Having no hopes, therefore, of persuading him to accompany me, I resolvedto proceed by myself.  About midnight I got my clothes in readiness,which consisted of two shirts, two pairs of trousers, twopocket-handkerchiefs, an upper and under waistcoat, a mat, and a pair ofhalf-boots; these, with a cloak, constituted my whole wardrobe.  And Ihad not one single bead, nor any other article of value in my possession,to purchase victuals for myself or corn for my horse.</p><p> </p><p> About daybreak, Johnson, who had been listening to the Moors all night,came and whispered to me that they were asleep.  The awful crisis was nowarrived when I was again either to taste the blessing of freedom orlanguish out my days in captivity.  A cold sweat moistened my forehead asI thought on the dreadful alternative, and reflected that, one way oranother, my fate must be decided in the course of the ensuing day.  Butto deliberate was to lose the only chance of escaping.  So, taking up mybundle, I stepped gently over the negroes, who were sleeping in the openair, and having mounted my horse, I bade Johnson farewell, desiring himto take particular care of the papers I had entrusted him with, andinform my friends in Gambia that he had left me in good health, on my wayto Bambarra.</p><p> </p><p> I proceeded with great caution, surveying each bush, and frequentlylistening and looking behind me for the Moorish horsemen, until I wasabout a mile from the town, when I was surprised to find myself in theneighbourhood of a korree belonging to the Moors.  The shepherds followedme for about a mile, hooting and throwing stones after me; and when I wasout of their reach, and had begun to indulge the pleasing hopes ofescaping, I was again greatly alarmed to hear somebody holloa behind me,and looking back, I saw three Moors on horseback, coming after me at fullspeed, whooping and brandishing their double-barrelled guns.  I knew itwas in vain to think of escaping, and therefore turned back and met them,when two of them caught hold of my bridle, one on each side, and thethird, presenting his musket, told me I must go back to Ali.  When thehuman mind has for some time been fluctuating between hope and despair,tortured with anxiety, and hurried from one extreme to another, itaffords a sort of gloomy relief to know the worst that can possiblyhappen.  Such was my situation.  An indifference about life and all itsenjoyments had completely benumbed my faculties, and I rode back with theMoors with apparent unconcern.  But a change took place much sooner thanI had any reason to expect.  In passing through some thick bushes one ofthe Moors ordered me to untie my bundle and show them the contents.Having examined the different articles, they found nothing worth takingexcept my cloak, which they considered as a very valuable acquisition,and one of them pulling it from me, wrapped it about himself, and, withone of his companions, rode off with their prize.  When I attempted tofollow them, the third, who had remained with me, struck my horse overthe head, and presenting his musket, told me I should proceed no farther.I now perceived that these men had not been sent by any authority toapprehend me, but had pursued me solely with a view to rob and plunderme.  Turning my horse’s head, therefore, once more towards the east, andobserving the Moor follow the track of his confederates, I congratulatedmyself on having escaped with my life, though in great distress, fromsuch a horde of barbarians.</p><p> </p><p> I was no sooner out of sight of the Moor than I struck into the woods toprevent being pursued, and kept pushing on with all possible speed, untilI found myself near some high rocks, which I remembered to have seen inmy former route from Queira to Deena and, directing my course a little tothe northward, I fortunately fell in with the path.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XIV.JOURNEY CONTINUED; ARRIVAL AT WAWRA.</p><p> </p><p> IT is impossible to describe the joy that arose in my mind when I lookedaround and concluded that I was out of danger.  I felt like one recoveredfrom sickness; I breathed freer; I found unusual lightness in my limbs;even the desert looked pleasant; and I dreaded nothing so much as fallingin with some wandering parties of Moors, who might convey me back to theland of thieves and murderers from which I had just escaped.</p><p> </p><p> I soon became sensible, however, that my situation was very deplorable,for I had no means of procuring food nor prospect of finding water.About ten o’clock, perceiving a herd of goats feeding close to the road,I took a circuitous route to avoid being seen, and continued travellingthrough the wilderness, directing my course by compass nearlyeast-south-east, in order to reach as soon as possible some town orvillage of the kingdom of Bambarra.</p><p> </p><p> A little after noon, when the burning heat of the sun was reflected withdouble violence from the hot sand, and the distant ridges of the hills,seen through the ascending vapour, seemed to wave and fluctuate like theunsettled sea, I became faint with thirst, and climbed a tree in hopes ofseeing distant smoke, or some other appearance of a human habitation—butin vain: nothing appeared all around but thick underwood and hillocks ofwhite sand.</p><p> </p><p> About four o’clock I came suddenly upon a large herd of goats, andpulling my horse into a bush, I watched to observe if the keepers wereMoors or negroes.  In a little time I perceived two Moorish boys, andwith some difficulty persuaded them to approach me.  They informed methat the herd belonged to Ali, and that they were going to Deena, wherethe water was more plentiful, and where they intended to stay until therain had filled the pools in the desert.  They showed me their emptywater-skins, and told me that they had seen no water in the woods.  Thisaccount afforded me but little consolation; however, it was in vain torepine, and I pushed on as fast as possible, in hopes of reaching somewatering-place in the course of the night.  My thirst was by this timebecome insufferable; my mouth was parched and inflamed; a sudden dimnesswould frequently come over my eyes, with other symptoms of fainting; andmy horse being very much fatigued, I began seriously to apprehend that Ishould perish of thirst.  To relieve the burning pain in my mouth andthroat I chewed the leaves of different shrubs, but found them allbitter, and of no service to me.</p><p> </p><p> A little before sunset, having reached the top of a gentle rising, Iclimbed a high tree, from the topmost branches of which I cast amelancholy look over the barren wilderness, but without discovering themost distant trace of a human dwelling.  The same dismal uniformity ofshrubs and sand everywhere presented itself, and the horizon was as leveland uninterrupted as that of the sea.</p><p> </p><p> Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring the stubble andbrushwood with great avidity; and as I was now too faint to attemptwalking, and my horse too much fatigued to carry me I thought it but anact of humanity, and perhaps the last I should ever have it in my powerto perform, to take off his bridle and let him shift for himself, indoing which I was suddenly affected with sickness and giddiness, andfalling upon the sand, felt as if the hour of death was fast approaching.Here, then, thought I, after a short but ineffectual struggle, terminateall my hopes of being useful in my day and generation; here must theshort span of my life come to an end.  I cast, as I believed, a last lookon the surrounding scene, and whilst I reflected on the awful change thatwas about to take place, this world with its enjoyment seemed to vanishfrom my recollection.  Nature, however, at length resumed its functions,and on recovering my senses, I found myself stretched upon the sand, withthe bridle still in my hand, and the sun just sinking behind the trees.I now summoned all my resolution, and determined to make another effortto prolong my existence; and as the evening was somewhat cool, I resolvedto travel as far as my limbs would carry me, in hopes of reaching—my onlyresource—a watering-place.  With this view I put the bridle on my horse,and driving him before me, went slowly along for about an hour, when Iperceived some lightning from the north-east—a most delightful sight, forit promised rain.  The darkness and lightning increased very rapidly, andin less than an hour I heard the wind roaring among the bushes.  I hadalready opened my mouth to receive the refreshing drops which I expected,but I was instantly covered with a cloud of sand, driven with such forceby the wind as to give a very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms,and I was obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush to preventbeing suffocated.  The sand continued to fly in amazing quantities fornearly an hour, after which I again set forward, and travelled withdifficulty until ten o’clock.  About this time I was agreeably surprisedby some very vivid flashes of lightning, followed by a few heavy drops ofrain.  In a little time the sand ceased to fly, and I alighted and spreadout all my clean clothes to collect the rain, which at length I saw wouldcertainly fall.  For more than an hour it rained plentifully, and Iquenched my thirst by wringing and sucking my clothes.</p><p> </p><p> There being no moon, it was remarkably dark, so that I was obliged tolead my horse, and direct my way by the compass, which the lightningenabled me to observe.  In this manner I travelled with tolerableexpedition until past midnight, when the lightning becoming more distant,I was under the necessity of groping along, to the no small danger of myhands and eyes.  About two o’clock my horse started at something, andlooking round, I was not a little surprised to see a light at a shortdistance among the trees; and supposing it to be a town, I groped alongthe sand in hopes of finding corn-stalks, cotton, or other appearances ofcultivation, but found none.  As I approached I perceived a number ofother lights in different places, and began to suspect that I had fallenupon a party of Moors.  However, in my present situation, I was resolvedto see who they were, if I could do it with safety.  I accordingly led myhorse cautiously towards the light, and heard by the lowing of the cattleand the clamorous tongues of the herdsmen, that it was a watering-place,and most likely belonged to the Moors.  Delightful as the sound of thehuman voice was to me, I resolved once more to strike into the woods, andrather run the risk of perishing of hunger than trust myself again intheir hands; but being still thirsty, and dreading the approach of theburning day, I thought it prudent to search for the wells, which Iexpected to find at no great distance.</p><p> </p><p> In this purpose I inadvertently approached so near to one of the tents asto be perceived by a woman, who immediately screamed out.  Two peoplecame running to her assistance from some of the neighbouring tents, andpassed so very near to me that I thought I was discovered, and hastenedagain into the woods.</p><p> </p><p> About a mile from this place I heard a loud and confused noise somewhereto the right of my course, and in a short time was happy to find it wasthe croaking of frogs, which was heavenly music to my ears.  I followedthe sound, and at daybreak arrived at some shallow muddy pools, so fullof frogs, that it was difficult to discern the water.  The noise theymade frightened my horse, and I was obliged to keep them quiet, bybeating the water with a branch, until he had drunk.  Having herequenched my thirst, I ascended a tree, and the morning being calm, I soonperceived the smoke of the watering-place which I had passed in thenight, and observed another pillar of smoke east-south-east, distanttwelve or fourteen miles.  Towards this I directed my route, and reachedthe cultivated ground a little before eleven o’clock, where, seeing anumber of negroes at work planting corn, I inquired the name of the town,and was informed that it was a Foulah village belonging to Ali, calledShrilla.  I had now some doubts about entering it; but my horse beingvery much fatigued, and the day growing hot—not to mention the pangs ofhunger, which began to assail me—I resolved to venture; and accordinglyrode up to the dooty’s house, where I was unfortunately deniedadmittance, and could not obtain oven a handful of corn either for myselfor horse.  Turning from this inhospitable door, I rode slowly out of thetown, and, perceiving some low, scattered huts without the walls, Idirected my route towards them, knowing that in Africa, as well as inEurope, hospitality does not always prefer the highest dwellings.  At thedoor of one of these huts an old motherly-looking woman sat, spinningcotton.  I made signs to her that I was hungry, and inquired if she hadany victuals with her in the hut.  She immediately laid down her distaff,and desired me, in Arabic, to come in.  When I had seated myself upon thefloor, she set before me a dish of kouskous that had been left thepreceding night, of which I made a tolerable meal; and in return for thiskindness I gave her one of my pocket-handkerchiefs, begging at the sametime a little corn for my horse, which she readily brought me.</p><p> </p><p> Whilst my horse was feeding the people began to assemble, and one of themwhispered something to my hostess which very much excited her surprise.Though I was not well acquainted with the Foulah language, I soondiscovered that some of the men wished to apprehend and carry me back toAli, in hopes, I suppose, of receiving a reward.  I therefore tied up thecorn; and lest any one should suspect I had run away from the Moors, Itook a northerly direction, and went cheerfully along, driving my horsebefore me, followed by all the boys and girls of the town.  When I hadtravelled about two miles, and got quit of all my troublesome attendants,I struck again into the woods, and took shelter under a large tree, whereI found it necessary to rest myself, a bundle of twigs serving me for abed, and my saddle for a pillow.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 4.—At daybreak I pursued my course through the woods as formerly;saw numbers of antelopes, wild hogs, and ostriches, but the soil was morehilly, and not so fertile as I had found it the preceding day.  Abouteleven o’clock I ascended an eminence, where I climbed a tree, anddiscovered, at about eight miles’ distance, an open part of the country,with several red spots, which I concluded were cultivated land, and,directing my course that way, came to the precincts of a watering-placeabout one o’clock.  From the appearance of the place, I judged it tobelong to the Foulahs, and was hopeful that I should meet a betterreception than I had experienced at Shrilla.  In this I was not deceived,for one of the shepherds invited me to come into his tent and partake ofsome dates.  This was one of those low Foulah tents in which there isroom just sufficient to sit upright, and in which the family, thefurniture, &c., seem huddled together like so many articles in a chest.When I had crept upon my hands and knees into this humble habitation, Ifound that it contained a woman and three children, who, together withthe shepherd and myself, completely occupied the floor.  A dish of boiledcorn and dates was produced, and the master of the family, as iscustomary in this part of the country, first tasted it himself, and thendesired me to follow his example.  Whilst I was eating, the children kepttheir eyes fixed upon me, and no sooner did the shepherd pronounce theword _Nazarani_, than they began to cry, and their mother crept slowlytowards the door, out of which she sprang like a greyhound, and wasinstantly followed by her children.  So frightened were they at the veryname of a Christian, that no entreaties could induce them to approach thetent.  Here I purchased some corn for my horse, in exchange for somebrass buttons, and having thanked the shepherd for his hospitality,struck again into the woods.  At sunset I came to a road that took thedirection for Bambarra, and resolved to follow it for the night; butabout eight o’clock, hearing some people coming from the southward, Ithought it prudent to hide myself among some thick bushes near the road.As these thickets are generally full of wild beasts, I found my situationrather unpleasant, sitting in the dark, holding my horse by the nose withboth hands, to prevent him from neighing, and equally afraid of thenatives without and the wild beasts within.  My fears, however, were soondissipated; for the people, after looking round the thicket, andperceiving nothing, went away, and I hastened to the more open parts ofthe wood, where I pursued my journey east-south-east, until pastmidnight, when the joyful cry of frogs induced me once more to deviate alittle from my route, in order to quench my thirst.  Having accomplishedthis from a large pool of rain-water, I sought for an open place, with asingle tree in the midst, under which I made my bed for the night.  I wasdisturbed by some wolves towards morning, which induced me to set forwarda little before day; and having passed a small village called Wassalita,I came about ten o’clock (July 5th), to a negro town called Wawra, whichproperly belongs to Kaarta, but was at this time tributary to Mansong,King of Bambarra.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XV.NEGRO CURIOSITY; A MESSAGE FROM THE KING.</p><p> </p><p> WAWRA is a small town surrounded with high walls, and inhabited by amixture of Mandingoes and Foulahs.  The inhabitants employ themselveschiefly in cultivating corn, which they exchange with the Moors for salt.Here, being in security from the Moors, and very much fatigued, Iresolved to rest myself; and meeting with a hearty welcome from thedooty, whose name was Flancharee, I laid myself down upon a bullock’shide, and slept soundly for about two hours.  The curiosity of the peoplewould not allow me to sleep any longer.  They had seen my saddle andbridle, and were assembled in great numbers to learn who I was and whenceI came.  Some were of opinion that I was an Arab; others insisted that Iwas some Moorish Sultan, and they continued to debate the matter withsuch warmth that the noise awoke me.  The dooty (who had formerly been atGambia) at last interposed in my behalf, and assured them that I wascertainly a white man; but he was convinced from my appearance that I wasa poor one.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 6.—It rained very much in the night, and at daylight I departed incompany with a negro who was going to a town called Dingyee for corn; butwe had not proceeded above a mile before the ass upon which he rode threwhim off, and he returned, leaving me to prosecute the journey by myself.</p><p> </p><p> I reached Dingyee about noon, but the dooty and most of the inhabitantshad gone into the fields to cultivate corn.  An old Foulah, observing mewandering about the town, desired me to come to his hut, where I was wellentertained; and the dooty, when he returned, sent me some victuals formyself and corn for my horse.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 7.—In the morning, when I was about to depart, my landlord, with agreat deal of diffidence, begged me to give him a lock of my hair.  Hehad been told, he said, that white men’s hair made a saphie that wouldgive to the possessor all the knowledge of white men.  I had never beforeheard of so simple a mode of education, but instantly complied with therequest.</p><p> </p><p> I reached a small town called Wassiboo, about twelve o’clock, where I wasobliged to stop until an opportunity should offer of procuring a guide toSatilé, which is distant a very long day’s journey, through woods withoutany beaten path.  I accordingly took up my residence at the dooty’shouse, where I stayed four days, during which time I amused myself bygoing to the fields with the family to plant corn.  Cultivation iscarried on here on a very extensive scale; and, as the natives themselvesexpress it, “Hunger is never known.”  In cultivating the soil the men andwomen work together.  They use a large sharp hoe, much superior to thatused in Gambia, but they are obliged, for fear of the Moors, to carrytheir arms with them to the field.  The master, with the handle of hisspear, marks the field into regular plats, one of which is assigned toevery three slaves.</p><p> </p><p> On the evening of the 11th eight of the fugitive Kaartans arrived atWassiboo.  They had found it impossible to live under the tyrannicalgovernment of the Moors, and were now going to transfer their allegianceto the King of Bambarra.  They offered to take me along with them as faras Satilé, and I accepted the offer.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 12.—At daybreak we set out, and travelled with uncommon expeditionuntil sunset.  We stopped only twice in the course of the day, once at awatering-place in the woods, and at another time at the ruins of a townformerly belonging to Daisy, called _Illa-compe_ (the corn-town).  Whenwe arrived in the neighbourhood of Satilé, the people who were employedin the corn-fields, seeing so many horsemen, took us for a party ofMoors, and ran screaming away from us.  The whole town was instantlyalarmed, and the slaves were seen in every direction driving the cattleand horses towards the town.  It was in vain that one of our companygalloped up to undeceive them; it only frightened them the more; and whenwe arrived at the town we found the gates shut, and the people all underarms.  After a long parley we were permitted to enter, and, as there wasevery appearance of a tornado, the dooty allowed us to sleep in his_baloon_, and gave us each a bullock’s hide for a bed.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 13.—Early in the morning we again set forward.  The roads were wetand slippery, but the country was very beautiful, abounding withrivulets, which were increased by the rain into rapid streams.  About teno’clock we came to-the rains of a village which had been destroyed by warabout six months before.</p><p> </p><p> About noon my horse was so much fatigued that I could not keep up with mycompanions; I therefore dismounted, and desired them to ride on, tellingthem that I would follow as soon as my horse had rested a little.  But Ifound them unwilling to leave me; the lions, they said, were verynumerous in those parts, and though they might not so readily attack abody of people, they would soon find out an individual; it was thereforeagreed that one of the company should stay with me to assist in drivingmy horse, while the others passed on to Galloo to procure lodgings, andcollect grass for the horses before night.  Accompanied by this worthynegro, I drove my horse before me until about four o’clock, when we camein sight of Galloo, a considerable town, standing in a fertile andbeautiful valley surrounded with high rocks.</p><p> </p><p> Early next morning (July 14th), having first returned many thanks to ourlandlord for his hospitality, while my fellow-travellers offered up theirprayers that he might never want, we set forward, and about three o’clockarrived at Moorja, a large town, famous for its trade in salt, which theMoors bring here in great quantities, to exchange for corn and cottoncloth.  As most of the people here are Mohammedans, it is not allowed tothe kafirs to drink beer, which they call _neodollo_ (corn spirit),except in certain houses.  In one of these I saw about twenty peoplesitting round large vessels of this beer with the greatest conviviality,many of them in a state of intoxication.</p><p> </p><p> On the morning of the 16th we again set forward, accompanied by a coffleof fourteen asses, loaded with salt, bound for Sansanding.  The road wasparticularly romantic, between two rocky hills; but the Moors sometimeslie in wait here to plunder strangers.  As soon as we had reached theopen country the master of the salt coffle thanked us for having stayedwith him so long, and now desired us to ride on.  The sun was almost setbefore we reached Datliboo.  In the evening we had a most tremendoustornado.  The house in which we lodged being flat-roofed, admitted therain in streams; the floor was soon ankle-deep, the fire extinguished,and we were left to pass the night upon some bundles of firewood thathappened to lie in a corner.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 17.—We departed from Datliboo, and about ten o’clock passed alarge coffle returning from Sego with corn-hoes, mats, and otherhousehold utensils.  At five o’clock we came to a large village where weintended to pass the night, but the dooty would not receive us.  When wedeparted from this place my horse was so much fatigued that I was underthe necessity of driving him, and it was dark before we reached Fanimboo,a small village, the dooty of which no sooner heard that I was a whiteman than he brought out three old muskets, and was much disappointed whenhe was told that I could not repair them.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 18.—We continued our journey, but, owing to a light supper thepreceding night we felt ourselves rather hungry this morning, andendeavoured to procure some corn at a village, but without success.</p><p> </p><p> My horse becoming weaker and weaker every day, was now of very littleservice to me; I was obliged to drive him before me for the greater partof the day, and did not reach Geosorro until eight o’clock in theevening.  I found my companions wrangling with the dooty, who hadabsolutely refused to give or sell them any provisions; and as none of ushad tasted victuals for the last twenty-four hours, we were by no meansdisposed to fast another day if we could help it.  But finding ourentreaties without effect, and being very much fatigued, I fell asleep,from which I was awakened about midnight with the joyful information_Kinne nata_! (“The victuals are come”)  This made the remainder of thenight pass away pleasantly, and at daybreak, July 19th, we resumed ourjourney, proposing to stop at a village called Doolinkeaboo for the nightfollowing.  My fellow-travellers, having better horses than myself, soonleft me, and I was walking barefoot, driving my horse, when I was met bya coffle of slaves, about seventy in number, coming from Sego.  They weretied together by their necks with thongs of a bullock’s hide, twistedlike a rope—seven slaves upon a thong, and a man with a musket betweenevery seven.  Many of the slaves were ill-conditioned, and a great numberof them women.  In the rear came Sidi Mahomed’s servant, whom Iremembered to have seen at the camp of Benowm.  He presently knew me, andtold me that these slaves were going to Morocco by the way of Ludamar andthe Great Desert.</p><p> </p><p> In the afternoon, as I approached Doolinkeaboo, I met about twenty Moorson horseback, the owners of the slaves I had seen in the morning.  Theywere well armed with muskets, and were very inquisitive concerning me,but not so rude as their countrymen generally are.  From them I learnedthat Sidi Mahomed was not at Sego, but had gone to Kancaba for gold-dust.</p><p> </p><p> When I arrived at Doolinkeaboo I was informed that my fellow-travellershad gone on, but my horse was so much fatigued that I could not possiblyproceed after them.  The dooty of the town at my request gave me adraught of water, which is generally looked upon as an earnest of greaterhospitality, and I had no doubt of making up for the toils of the day bya good supper and a sound sleep; unfortunately, I had neither the one northe other.  The night was rainy and tempestuous, and the dooty limitedhis hospitality to the draught of water.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 20.—In the morning I endeavoured, both by entreaties and threats,to procure some victuals from the dooty, but in vain.  I even begged somecorn from one of his female slaves, as she was washing it at the well,and had the mortification to be refused.  However, when the dooty wasgone to the fields, his wife sent me a handful of meal, which I mixedwith water and drank for breakfast.  About eight o’clock I departed fromDoolinkeaboo, and at noon stopped a few minutes at a large korree, whereI had some milk given me by the Foulahs, and hearing that two negroeswere going from thence to Sega, I was happy to have their company, and weset out immediately.  About four o’clock we stopped at a small village,where one of the negroes met with an acquaintance, who invited us to asort of public entertainment, which was conducted with more than commonpropriety.  A dish, made of sour milk and meal, called _sinkatoo_, andbeer made from their corn, was distributed with great liberality, and thewomen were admitted into the society, a circumstance I had never beforeobserved in Africa.  There was no compulsion—every one was at liberty todrink as he pleased—they nodded to each other when about to drink, and onsetting down the calabash commonly said _Berka_ (“Thank you”).  Both menand women appeared to be somewhat intoxicated, but they were far frombeing quarrelsome.</p><p> </p><p> Departing from thence, we passed several large villages, where I wasconstantly taken for a Moor and became the subject of much merriment tothe Bambarrans, who, seeing me drive my horse before me, laughed heartilyat my appearance.  “He has been at Mecca,” says one, “you may see that byhis clothes;” another asked me if my horse was sick; a third wished topurchase it, &c., so that, I believe, the very slaves were ashamed to beseen in my company.  Just before it was dark we took up our lodging forthe night at a small village, where I procured some victuals for myselfand some corn for my horse, at the moderate price of a button; and wastold that I should see the Niger (which the negroes call Joliba, or theGreat Water) early the next day.  The lions are here very numerous; thegates are shut a little after sunset, and nobody allowed to go out.  Thethoughts of seeing the Niger in the morning, and the troublesome buzzingof mosquitoes, prevented me from shutting my eyes during the night; and Ihad saddled my horse, and was in readiness before daylight, but, onaccount of the wild beasts, we were obliged to wait until the people werestirring and the gates opened.  This happened to be a market day at Sego,and the roads were everywhere filled with people carrying differentarticles to sell.  We passed four large villages, and at eight o’clocksaw the smoke over Sego.</p><p> </p><p> As we approached the town I was fortunate enough to overtake the fugitiveKaartans, to whose kindness I had been so much indebted in my journeythrough Bambarra.  They readily agreed to introduce me to the king; andwe rode together through some marshy ground, where, as I was anxiouslylooking around for the river, one of them called out, _Geo affili_! (“Seethe water!”) and, looking forwards, I saw with infinite pleasure thegreat object of my mission—the long-sought-for majestic Niger, glitteringin the morning sun, as broad as the Thames at Westminster, and flowingslowly to _the eastward_.  I hastened to the brink, and having drunk ofthe water, lifted up my fervent thanks in prayer to the Great Ruler ofall things for having thus far crowned my endeavours with success.</p><p> </p><p> The circumstance of the Niger’s flowing towards the east, and itscollateral points, did not, however, excite my surprise, for, although Ihad left Europe in great hesitation on this subject, and rather believedthat it ran in the contrary direction, I had made such frequent inquiriesduring my progress concerning this river, and received from the negroesof different nations such clear and decisive assurances that its generalcourse was _towards the rising sun_, as scarce left any doubt on my mind,and more especially as I knew that Major Houghton had collected similarinformation in the same manner.</p><p> </p><p> Sego, the capital of Bambarra, at which I had now arrived, consists,properly speaking, of four distinct towns—two on the northern bank of theNiger, called Sego Korro and Sego Boo; and two on the southern bank,called Sego Soo Korro and Sego See Korro.  They are all surrounded withhigh mud walls.  The houses are built of clay, of a square form with flatroofs—some of them have two storeys, and many of them are whitewashed.Besides these buildings, Moorish mosques are seen in every quarter; andthe streets, though narrow, are broad enough for every useful purpose, ina country where wheel carriages are entirely unknown.  From the bestinquiries I could make, I have reason to believe that Sego containsaltogether about thirty thousand inhabitants.  The King of Bambarraconstantly resides at Sego See Korro.  He employs a great many slaves inconveying people over the river, and the money they receive (though thefare is only ten kowrie shells for each individual) furnishes aconsiderable revenue to the king in the course of a year.  The canoes areof a singular construction, each of them being formed of the trunks oftwo large trees rendered concave, and joined together, not side by side,but endways—the junction being exactly across the middle of the canoe:they are therefore very long, and disproportionably narrow, and haveneither decks nor masts: they are, however, very roomy, for I observed inone of them four horses and several people crossing over the river.  Whenwe arrived at this ferry, with a view to pass over to that part of thetown in which the king resides, we found a great number waiting for apassage: they looked at me with silent wonder, and I distinguished withconcern many Moors among them.  There were three different places ofembarkation, and the ferrymen were very diligent and expeditious; butfrom the crowd of people I could not immediately obtain a passage, andsat down upon the bank of the river to wait for a more favourableopportunity.  The view of this extensive city—the numerous canoes uponthe river—the crowded population, and the cultivated state of thesurrounding country—formed altogether a prospect of civilisation andmagnificence which I little expected to find in the bosom of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> I waited more than two hours without having an opportunity of crossingthe river, during which time the people who had crossed carriedinformation to Mansong, the king, that a white man was waiting for apassage, and was coming to see him.  He immediately sent over one of hischief men, who informed me that the king could not possibly see me untilhe knew what had brought me into his country; and that I must not presumeto cross the river without the king’s permission.  He therefore advisedme to lodge at a distant village, to which he pointed, for the night, andsaid that in the morning he would give me further instructions how toconduct myself.  This was very discouraging.  However, as there was noremedy, I set off for the village, where I found, to my greatmortification, that no person would admit me into his house.  I wasregarded with astonishment and fear, and was obliged to sit all daywithout victuals in the shade of a tree; and the night threatened to bevery uncomfortable—for the wind rose, and there was great appearance of aheavy rain—and the wild beasts are so very numerous in the neighbourhoodthat I should have been under the necessity of climbing up a tree andresting amongst the branches.  About sunset, however, as I was preparingto pass the night in this manner, and had turned my horse loose that hemight graze at liberty, a woman, returning from the labours of the field,stopped to observe me, and perceiving that I was weary and dejected,inquired into my situation, which I briefly explained to her; whereupon,with looks of great compassion, she took up my saddle and bridle, andtold me to follow her.  Having conducted me into her hut, she lighted upa lamp, spread a mat on the floor, and told me I might remain there forthe night.  Finding that I was very hungry, she said she would procure mesomething to eat.  She accordingly went out, and returned in a short timewith a very fine fish, which, having caused to be half broiled upon someembers, she gave me for supper.  The rites of hospitality being thusperformed towards a stranger in distress, my worthy benefactress(pointing to the mat, and telling me I might sleep there withoutapprehension) called to the female part of her family, who had stoodgazing on me all the while in fixed astonishment, to resume their task ofspinning cotton, in which they continued to employ themselves great partof the night.  They lightened their labour by songs, one of which wascomposed extempore, for I was myself the subject of it.  It was sung byone of the young women, the rest joining in a sort of chorus.  The airwas sweet and plaintive, and the words, literally translated, werethese:—“The winds roared, and the rains fell.  The poor white man, faintand weary, came and sat under our tree.  He has no mother to bring himmilk, no wife to grind his corn.  _Chorus_.—Let us pity the white man, nomother has he,” &c. &c.  Trifling as this recital may appear to thereader, to a person in my situation the circumstance was affecting in thehighest degree.  I was oppressed by such unexpected kindness, and sleepfled from my eyes.  In the morning I presented my compassionate landladywith two of the four brass buttons which remained on my waistcoat—theonly recompense I could make her.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 21.—I continued in the village all this day in conversation withthe natives, who came in crowds to see me, but was rather uneasy towardsevening to find that no message had arrived from the king, the more so asthe people began to whisper that Mansong had received some veryunfavourable accounts of me from the Moors and slatees residing at Sego,who, it seems, were exceedingly suspicious concerning the motives of myjourney.  I learned that many consultations had been held with the kingconcerning my reception and disposal; and some of the villagers franklytold me that I had many enemies, and must expect no favour.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 22.—About eleven o’clock a messenger arrived from the king, but hegave me very little satisfaction.  He inquired particularly if I hadbrought any present, and seemed much disappointed when he was told that Ihad been robbed of everything by the Moors.  When I proposed to go alongwith him, he told me to stop until the afternoon, when the king wouldsend for me.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 23.—In the afternoon another messenger arrived from Mansong, witha bag in his hands.  He told me it was the king’s pleasure that I shoulddepart forthwith from the vicinage of Sego; but that Mansong, wishing torelieve a white man in distress, had sent me five thousand kowries, toenable me to purchase provisions in the course of my journey: themessenger added, that if my intentions were really to proceed to Jenné,he had orders to accompany me as a guide to Sansanding.  I was at firstpuzzled to account for this behaviour of the king; but from theconversation I had with the guide, I had afterwards reason to believethat Mansong would willingly have admitted me into his presence at Sego,but was apprehensive he might not be able to protect me against the blindand inveterate malice of the Moorish inhabitants.  His conduct,therefore, was at once prudent and liberal.  The circumstances underwhich I made my appearance at Sego were undoubtedly such as might createin the mind of the king a well-warranted suspicion that I wished toconceal the true object of my journey.  He argued, probably, as my guideargued, who, when he was told that I had come from a great distance, andthrough many dangers, to behold the Joliba river, naturally inquired ifthere were no rivers in my own country, and whether one river was notlike another.  Notwithstanding this, and in spite of the jealousmachinations of the Moors, this benevolent prince thought it sufficientthat a white man was found in his dominions, in a condition of extremewretchedness, and that no other plea was necessary to entitle thesufferer to his bounty.</p><p> </p><p> FOOTNOTES</p><p> </p><p> {41}  I believe that similar charms or amulets, under the names of_domini_, _grigri_, _fetich_, &c., are common in all parts of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> {70}  Maana is within a short distance of the ruins of Fort St. Joseph,on the Senegal river, formerly a French factory.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XVI.VILLAGES ON THE NIGER—DETERMINES TO GO NO FARTHER EASTWARD.</p><p> </p><p> BEING, in the manner that has been related, compelled to leave Sego, Iwas conducted the same evening to a village about seven miles to theeastward, with some of the inhabitants of which my guide was acquainted,and by whom we were well received. {7}  He was very friendly andcommunicative, and spoke highly of the hospitality of his countrymen, butwithal told me that if Jenné was the place of my destination, which heseemed to have hitherto doubted, I had undertaken an enterprise ofgreater danger than probably I was apprised of; for, although the town ofJenné was nominally a part of the king of Bambarra’s dominions, it was infact, he said, a city of the Moors—the leading part of the inhabitantsbeing bushreens, and even the governor himself, though appointed byMansong, of the same sect.  Thus was I in danger of falling a second timeinto the hands of men who would consider it not only justifiable, butmeritorious, to destroy me, and this reflection was aggravated by thecircumstance that the danger increased as I advanced in my journey, for Ilearned that the places beyond Jenné were under the Moorish influence ina still greater degree than Jenné itself, and Timbuctoo, the great objectof my search, altogether in possession of that savage and mercilesspeople, who allow no Christian to live there.  But I had now advanced toofar to think of returning to the westward on such vague and uncertaininformation, and determined to proceed; and being accompanied by theguide, I departed from the village on the morning of the 24th.  Abouteight o’clock we passed a large town called Kabba, situated in the midstof a beautiful and highly cultivated country, bearing a greaterresemblance to the centre of England than to what I should have supposedhad been the middle of Africa.  The people were everywhere employed incollecting the fruit of shea trees, from which they prepare the vegetablebutter mentioned in former parts of this work.  These trees grow in greatabundance all over this part of Bambarra.  They are not planted by thenatives, but are found growing naturally in the woods; and in clearingwoodland for cultivation every tree is cut down but the shea.  The treeitself very much resembles the American oak, and the fruit—from thekernel of which, being first dried in the sun, the butter is prepared byboiling the kernel in water—has somewhat the appearance of a Spanisholive.  The kernel is enveloped in a sweet pulp, under a thin green rind;and the butter produced from it, besides the advantage of its keeping thewhole year without salt, is whiter, firmer, and, to my palate, of aricher flavour, than the best butter I ever tasted made from cow’s milk.The growth and preparation of this commodity seem to be among the firstobjects of African industry in this and the neighbouring states, and itconstitutes a main article of their inland commerce.</p><p> </p><p> We passed, in the course of the day, a great many villages inhabitedchiefly by fishermen, and in the evening about five o’clock arrived atSansanding, a very large town, containing, as I was told, from eight toten thousand inhabitants.  This place is much resorted to by the Moors,who bring salt from Berroo, and beads and coral from the Mediterranean,to exchange here for gold dust and cotton cloth.  This cloth they sell togreat advantage in Berroo, and other Moorish countries, where, on accountof the want of rain, no cotton is cultivated.</p><p> </p><p> I desired my guide to conduct me to the house in which we were to lodgeby the most private way possible.  We accordingly rode along between thetown and the river, passing by a creek or harbour, in which I observedtwenty large canoes, most of them fully loaded, and covered with mats toprevent the rain from injuring the goods.  As we proceeded, three othercanoes arrived, two with passengers and one with goods.  I was happy tofind that all the negro inhabitants took me for a Moor, under whichcharacter I should probably have passed unmolested, had not a Moor, whowas sitting by the river-side, discovered the mistake, and, setting up aloud exclamation, brought together a number of his countrymen.</p><p> </p><p> When I arrived at the house of Counti Mamadi, the dooty of the town, Iwas surrounded with hundreds of people speaking a variety of differentdialects, all equally unintelligible to me.  At length, by the assistanceof my guide, who acted as interpreter, I understood that one of thespectators pretended to have seen me at one place, and another at someother place; and a Moorish woman absolutely swore that she had kept myhouse three years at Gallam, on the river Senegal.  It was plain thatthey mistook me for some other person, and I desired two of the mostconfident to point towards the place where they had seen me.  Theypointed due south; hence I think it probable that they came from CapeCoast, where they might have seen many white men.  Their language wasdifferent from any I had yet heard.  The Moors now assembled in greatnumber, with their usual arrogance, compelling the negroes to stand at adistance.  They immediately began to question me concerning my religion,but finding that I was not master of Arabic, they sent for two men, whomthey call _Ilhuidi_ (Jews), in hopes that they might be able to conversewith me.  These Jews, in dress and appearance, very much resemble theArabs; but though they so far conform to the religion of Mohammed as torecite in public prayers from the Koran, they are but little respected bythe negroes; and even the Moors themselves allowed that, though I was aChristian, I was a better man than a Jew.  They however insisted that,like the Jews, I must conform so far as to repeat the Mohammedan prayers;and when I attempted to waive the subject by telling them that I couldnot speak Arabic, one of them, a shereef from Tuat, in the Great Desert,started up and swore by the Prophet that if I refused to go to themosque, he would be one that would assist in carrying me thither; andthere is no doubt that this threat would have been immediately executedhad not my landlord interposed on my behalf.  He told them that I was theking’s stranger, and he could not see me ill-treated whilst I was underhis protection.  He therefore advised them to let me alone for the night,assuring them that in the morning I should be sent about my business.This somewhat appeased their clamour, but they compelled me to ascend ahigh seat by the door of the mosque, in order that everybody might seeme, for the people had assembled in such numbers as to be quiteungovernable, climbing upon the houses, and squeezing each other, likethe spectators at an execution.  Upon this seat I remained until sunset,when I was conducted into a neat little hut, with a small court beforeit, the door of which Counti Mamadi shut, to prevent any person fromdisturbing me.  But this precaution could not exclude the Moors.  Theyclimbed over the top of the mud wall, and came in crowds into the court,“in order,” they said, “to see me _perform my evening devotions_, _andeat eggs_.”  The former of these ceremonies I did not think proper tocomply with, but I told them I had no objection to eat eggs, providedthey would bring me eggs to eat.  My landlord immediately brought meseven hen’s eggs, and was much surprised to find that I could not eatthem raw; for it seems to be a prevalent opinion among the inhabitants ofthe interior that Europeans subsist almost entirely on this diet.  When Ihad succeeded in persuading my landlord that this opinion was withoutfoundation, and that I would gladly partake of any victuals which hemight think proper to send me, he ordered a sheep to be killed, and partof it to be dressed for my supper.  About midnight, when the Moors hadleft me, he paid me a visit, and with much earnestness desired me towrite him a saphie.  “If a Moor’s saphie is good,” said this hospitableold man, “a white man’s must needs be better.”  I readily furnished himwith one, possessed of all the virtues I could concentrate, for itcontained the Lord’s Prayer.  The pen with which it was written was madeof a reed; a little charcoal and gum-water made very tolerable ink, and athin board answered the purpose of paper.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 25.—Early in the morning, before the Moors were assembled, Ideparted from Sansanding, and slept the ensuing night at a small towncalled Sibili, from whence on the day following I reached Nyara, a largetown at some distance from the river, where I halted the 27th, to have myclothes washed, and recruit my horse.  The dooty there has a verycommodious house, flat-roofed, and two storeys high.  He showed me somegunpowder of his own manufacturing; and pointed out, as a greatcuriosity, a little brown monkey that was tied to a stake by the door,telling me that it came from a far distant country called Kong.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 28.—I departed from Nyara, and reached Nyamee about noon.  Thistown is inhabited chiefly by Foulahs from the kingdom of Masina.  Thedooty, I know not why, would not receive me, but civilly sent his son onhorseback to conduct me to Modiboo, which he assured me was at no greatdistance.</p><p> </p><p> We rode nearly in a direct line through the woods, but in general wentforwards with great circumspection.  I observed that my guide frequentlystopped and looked under the bushes.  On inquiring the reason of thiscaution he told me that lions were very numerous in that part of thecountry, and frequently attacked people travelling through the woods.While he was speaking, my horse started, and looking round, I observed alarge animal of the camelopard kind standing at a little distance.  Theneck and fore-legs were very long; the head was furnished with two shortblack horns, turning backwards; the tail, which reached down to the hamjoint, had a tuft of hair at the end.  The animal was of a mouse colour,and it trotted away from us in a very sluggish manner—moving its headfrom side to side, to see if we were pursuing it.  Shortly after this, aswe were crossing a large open plain, where there were a few scatteredbushes, my guide, who was a little way before me, wheeled his horse roundin a moment, calling out something in the Foulah language which I did notunderstand.  I inquired in Mandingo what he meant; “_Wara billi billi_!”(“A very large lion!”) said he, and made signs for me to ride away.  Butmy horse was too much fatigued; so we rode slowly past the bush fromwhich the animal had given us the alarm.  Not seeing anything myself,however, I thought my guide had been mistaken, when the Foulah suddenlyput his hand to his mouth, exclaiming, “_Soubah an allahi_!” (“Godpreserve us!”) and, to my great surprise, I then perceived a large redlion, at a short distance from the bush, with his head couched betweenhis forepaws.  I expected he would instantly spring upon me, andinstinctively pulled my feet from my stirrups to throw myself on theground, that my horse might become the victim rather than myself.  But itis probable the lion was not hungry; for he quietly suffered us to pass,though we were fairly within his reach.  My eyes were so riveted uponthis sovereign of the beasts that I found it impossible to remove themuntil we were at a considerable distance.  We now took a circuitous routethrough some swampy ground, to avoid any more of these disagreeableencounters.  At sunset we arrived at Modiboo—a delightful village on thebanks of the Niger, commanding a view of the river for many miles both tothe east and west.  The small green islands (the peaceful retreat of someindustrious Foulahs, whose cattle are here secure from the depredationsof wild beasts) and the majestic breadth of the river, which is here muchlarger than at Sego, render the situation one of the most enchanting inthe world.  Here are caught great plenty of fish, by means of long cottonnets, which the natives make themselves, and use nearly in the samemanner as nets are used in Europe.  I observed the head of a crocodilelying upon one of the houses, which they told me had been killed by theshepherds in a swamp near the town.  These animals are not uncommon inthe Niger, but I believe they are not oftentimes found dangerous.  Theyare of little account to the traveller when compared with the amazingswarms of mosquitoes, which rise from the swamps and creeks in suchnumbers as to harass even the most torpid of the natives; and as myclothes were now almost worn to rags, I was but ill prepared to resisttheir attacks.  I usually passed the night without shutting my eyes,walking backwards and forwards, fanning myself with my hat; their stingsraised numerous blisters on my legs and arms, which, together with thewant of rest, made me very feverish and uneasy.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 29.—Early in the morning, my landlord, observing that I wassickly, hurried me away, sending a servant with me as a guide to Kea.But though I was little able to walk, my horse was still less able tocarry me; and about six miles to the east of Modiboo, in crossing somerough clayey ground, he fell, and the united strength of the guide andmyself could not place him again upon his legs.  I sat down for some timebeside this worn-out associate of my adventures, but finding him stillunable to rise, I took off the saddle and bridle, and placed a quantityof grass before him.  I surveyed the poor animal, as he lay panting onthe ground, with sympathetic emotion, for I could not suppress the sadapprehension that I should myself, in a short time, lie down and perishin the same manner, of fatigue and hunger.  With this foreboding I leftmy poor horse, and with great reluctance followed my guide on foot alongthe bank of the river until about noon, when we reached Kea, which Ifound to be nothing more than a small fishing village.  The dooty, asurly old man, who was sitting by the gate, received me very coolly; andwhen I informed him of my situation, and begged his protection, told mewith great indifference that he paid very little attention to finespeeches, and that I should not enter his house.  My guide remonstratedin my favour, but to no purpose, for the dooty remained inflexible in hisdetermination.  I knew not where to rest my wearied limbs, but washappily relieved by a fishing canoe belonging to Silla, which was at thatmoment coming down the river.  The dooty waved to the fisherman to comenear, and desired him to take charge of me as far as Moorzan.  Thefisherman, after some hesitation, consented to carry me, and I embarkedin the canoe in company with the fisherman, his wife, and a boy.  Thenegro who had conducted me from Modiboo now left me.  I requested him tolook to my horse on his return, and take care of him if he was stillalive, which he promised to do.</p><p> </p><p> Departing from Kea, we proceeded about a mile down the river, when thefisherman paddled the canoe to the bank and desired me to jump out.Having tied the canoe to a stake, he stripped off his clothes, and divedfor such a length of time that I thought he had actually drowned himself,and was surprised to see his wife behave with so much indifference uponthe occasion; but my fears were over when he raised up his head astern ofthe canoe and called for a rope.  With this rope he dived a second time,and then got into the canoe and ordered the boy to assist him in pulling.At length they brought up a large basket, about ten feet in diameter,containing two fine fish, which the fisherman—after returning the basketinto the water—immediately carried ashore and hid in the grass.  We thenwent a little farther down and took up another basket, in which was onefish.  The fisherman now left us to carry his prizes to some neighbouringmarket, and the woman and boy proceeded with me in the canoe down theriver.</p><p> </p><p> About four o’clock we arrived at Moorzan, a fishing town on the northernbank, from whence I was conveyed across the river to Silla, a large town,where I remained until it was quite dark, under a tree, surrounded byhundreds of people.</p><p> </p><p> With a great deal of entreaty the dooty allowed me to come into hisbaloon to avoid the rain, but the place was very damp, and I had a smartparoxysm of fever during the night.  Worn down by sickness, exhaustedwith hunger and fatigue, half-naked, and without any article of value bywhich I might procure provisions, clothes, or lodging, I began to reflectseriously on my situation.  I was now convinced, by painful experience,that the obstacles to my farther progress were insurmountable.  Thetropical rains were already set in with all their violence—the ricegrounds and swamps were everywhere overflowed—and in a few days more,travelling of every kind, unless by water, would be completelyobstructed.  The kowries which remained of the king of Bambarra’s presentwere not sufficient to enable me to hire a canoe for any great distance,and I had but little hopes of subsisting by charity in a country wherethe Moors have such influence.  But, above all, I perceived that I wasadvancing more and more within the power of those merciless fanatics,and, from my reception both at Sego and Sansanding, I was apprehensivethat, in attempting to reach even Jenné (unless under the protection ofsome man of consequence amongst them, which I had no means of obtaining),I should sacrifice my life to no purpose, for my discoveries would perishwith me.  The prospect either way was gloomy.  In returning to theGambia, a journey on foot of many hundred miles presented itself to mycontemplation, through regions and countries unknown.  Nevertheless, thisseemed to be the only alternative, for I saw inevitable destruction inattempting to proceed to the eastward.  With this conviction on my mind Ihope my readers will acknowledge that I did right in going no farther.</p><p> </p><p> Having thus brought my mind, after much doubt and perplexity, to adetermination to return westward, I thought it incumbent on me, before Ileft Silla, to collect from the Moorish and negro traders all theinformation I could concerning the farther course of the Niger eastward,and the situation and extent of the kingdoms in its vicinage; and thefollowing few notices I received from such various quarters as induce meto think they are authentic:—</p><p> </p><p> Two short days’ journey to the eastward of Silla is the town of Jenné,which is situated on a small island in the river, and is said to containa greater number of inhabitants than Sego itself, or any other town inBambarra.  At the distance of two days more, the river spreads into aconsiderable lake, called Dibbie (or the Dark Lake), concerning theextent of which all the information I could obtain was that in crossingit from west to east the canoes lose sight of land one whole day.  Fromthis lake the water issues in many different streams, which terminate intwo large branches, one whereof flows towards the north-east, and theother to the east; but these branches join at Kabra, which is one day’sjourney to the southward of Timbuctoo, and is the port or shipping-placeof that city.  The tract of land which the two streams encircle is calledJinbala, and is inhabited by negroes; and the whole distance by land fromJenné to Timbuctoo is twelve days’ journey.</p><p> </p><p> From Kabra, at the distance of eleven days’ journey down the stream, theriver passes to the southward of Houssa, which is two days’ journeydistant from the river.  Of the farther progress of this great river, andits final exit, all the natives with whom I conversed seemed to beentirely ignorant.  Their commercial pursuits seldom induce them totravel farther than the cities of Timbuctoo and Houssa, and as the soleobject of those journeys is the acquirement of wealth, they pay littleattention to the course of rivers or the geography of countries.  It is,however, highly probable that the Niger affords a safe and easycommunication between very remote nations.  All my informants agreed thatmany of the negro merchants who arrive at Timbuctoo and Houssa from theeastward speak a different language from that of Bambarra, or any otherkingdom with which they are acquainted But even these merchants, it wouldseem, are ignorant of the termination of the river, for such of them ascan speak Arabic describe the amazing length of its course in verygeneral terms, saying only that they believe it runs _to the world’send_.</p><p> </p><p> The names of many kingdoms to the eastward of Houssa are familiar to theinhabitants of Bambarra.  I was shown quivers and arrows of very curiousworkmanship, which I was informed came from the kingdom of Kassina.</p><p> </p><p> On the northern bank of the Niger, at a short distance from Silla, is thekingdom of Masina, which is inhabited by Foulahs.  They employ themselvesthere, as in other places, chiefly in pasturage, and pay an annualtribute to the king of Bambarra for the lands which they occupy.</p><p> </p><p> To the north-east of Masina is situated the kingdom of Timbuctoo, thegreat object of European research—the capital of this kingdom being oneof the principal marts for that extensive commerce which the Moors carryon with the negroes.  The hopes of acquiring wealth in this pursuit, andzeal for propagating their religion, have filled this extensive city withMoors and Mohammedan converts.  The king himself and all the chiefofficers of state are Moors; and they are said to be more severe andintolerant in their principles than any other of the Moorish tribes inthis part of Africa.  I was informed by a venerable old negro, that whenhe first visited Timbuctoo, he took up his lodging at a sort of publicinn, the landlord of which, when he conducted him into his hut, spread amat on the floor, and laid a rope upon it, saying, “If you are aMussulman, you are my friend—sit down; but if you are a kafir, you are myslave, and with this rope I will lead you to market.”  The present kingof Timbuctoo is named Abu Abrahima.  He is reported to possess immenseriches.  His wives and concubines are said to be clothed in silk, and thechief officers of state live in considerable splendour.  The wholeexpense of his government is defrayed, as I was told, by a tax uponmerchandise, which is collected at the gates of the city.</p><p> </p><p> The city of Houssa (the capital of a large kingdom of the same name,situated to the eastward of Timbuctoo), is another great mart for Moorishcommerce.  I conversed with many merchants who had visited that city, andthey all agreed that it is larger—and more populous than Timbuctoo.  Thetrade, police, and government are nearly the same in both; but in Houssathe negroes are in greater proportion to the Moors, and have some sharein the government.</p><p> </p><p> Concerning the small kingdom of Jinbala I was not able to collect muchinformation.  The soil is said to be remarkably fertile, and the wholecountry so full of creeks and swamps that the Moors have hitherto beenbaffled in every attempt to subdue it.  The inhabitants are negroes, andsome of them are said to live in considerable affluence, particularlythose near the capital, which is a resting-place for such merchants astransport goods from Timbuctoo to the western parts of Africa.</p><p> </p><p> To the southward of Jinbala is situated the negro kingdom of Gotto, whichis said to be of great extent.  It was formerly divided into a number ofpetty states, which were governed by their own chiefs; but their privatequarrels invited invasion from the neighbouring kingdoms.  At length apolitic chief of the name of Moossee had address enough to make themunite in hostilities against Bambarra; and on this occasion he wasunanimously chosen general—the different chiefs consenting for a time toact under his command.  Moossee immediately despatched a fleet of canoes,loaded with provisions, from the banks of the lake Dibbie up the Nigertowards Jenné, and with the whole of his army pushed forwards intoBambarra.  He arrived on the bank of the Niger opposite to Jenné beforethe townspeople had the smallest intimation of his approach.  His fleetof canoes joined him the same day, and having landed the provisions, heembarked part of his army, and in the night took Jenné by storm.  Thisevent so terrified the king of Bambarra that he sent messengers to suefor peace; and in order to obtain it consented to deliver to Moossee acertain number of slaves every year, and return everything that had beentaken from the inhabitants of Gotto.  Moossee, thus triumphant, returnedto Gotto, where he was declared king, and the capital of the country iscalled by his name.</p><p> </p><p> On the west of Gotto is the kingdom of Baedoo, which was conquered by thepresent king of Bambarra about seven years ago, and has continuedtributary to him ever since.</p><p> </p><p> West of Baedoo is Maniana, the inhabitants of which, according to thebest information I was able to collect, are cruel and ferocious—carryingtheir resentment towards their enemies so far as never to give quarter,and even to indulge themselves with unnatural and disgusting banquets ofhuman flesh.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XVII.MOORZAN TO TAFFARA.</p><p> </p><p> HAVING, for the reasons assigned in the last chapter, determined toproceed no farther eastward than Silla, I acquainted the dooty with myintention of returning to Sego, proposing to travel along the southernside of the river; but he informed me that, from the number of creeks andswamps on that side, it was impossible to travel by any other route thanalong the northern bank, and even that route, he said, would soon beimpassable on account of the overflowing of the river.  However, as hecommended my determination to return westward, he agreed to speak to someone of the fishermen to carry me over to Moorzan.  I accordingly steppedinto a canoe about eight o’clock in the morning of July 30th, and inabout an hour was landed at Moorzan.  At this place I hired a canoe forsixty kowries, and in the afternoon arrived at Kea, where, for fortykowries more, the dooty permitted me to sleep in the same hut with one ofhis slaves.  This poor negro, perceiving that I was sickly, and that myclothes were very ragged, humanely lent me a large cloth to cover me forthe night.</p><p> </p><p> _July_ 31.—The dooty’s brother being going to Modiboo, I embraced theopportunity of accompanying him thither, there being no beaten road.  Hepromised to carry my saddle, which I had left at Kea, when my horse felldown in the woods, as I now proposed to present it to the king ofBambarra.</p><p> </p><p> We departed from Kea at eight o’clock, and about a mile to the westwardobserved on the bank of the river a great number of earthen jars piled uptogether.  They were very neatly formed, but not glazed, and wereevidently of that sort of pottery which is manufactured at Downie (a townto the west of Timbuctoo), and sold to great advantage in different partsof Bambarra.  As we approached towards the jars my companion plucked up alarge handful of herbage, and threw it upon them, making signs for me todo the same, which I did.  He then, with great seriousness told me thatthese jars belonged to some supernatural power; that they were found intheir present situation about two years ago; and as no person had claimedthem, every traveller as he passed them, from respect to the invisibleproprietor, threw some grass, or the branch of a tree, upon the heap, todefend the jars from the rain.</p><p> </p><p> Thus conversing, we travelled in the most friendly manner, untilunfortunately we perceived the footsteps of a lion, quite fresh in themud, near the river-side.  My companion now proceeded with greatcircumspection; and at last, coming to some thick underwood, he insistedthat I should walk before him.  I endeavoured to excuse myself, byalleging that I did not know the road; but he obstinately persisted, and,after a few high words and menacing looks, threw down the saddle and wentaway.  This very much disconcerted me; but as I had given up all hopes ofobtaining a horse, I could not think of encumbering myself with thesaddle, and, taking off the stirrups and girths, I threw the saddle intothe river.  The negro no sooner saw me throw the saddle into the waterthan he came running from among the bushes where he had concealedhimself, jumped into the river, and by help of his spear, brought out thesaddle and ran away with it.  I continued my course along the bank; butas the wood was remarkably thick, and I had reason to believe that a lionwas at no great distance, I became much alarmed, and took a long circuitthrough the bushes to avoid him.</p><p> </p><p> About four in the afternoon I reached Modiboo, where I found my saddle.The guide, who had got there before me, being afraid that I should informthe king of his conduct, had brought the saddle with him in a canoe.</p><p> </p><p> While I was conversing with the dooty, and remonstrating against theguide for having left me in such a situation, I heard a horse neigh inone of the huts; and the dooty inquired with a smile if I knew who wasspeaking to me.  He explained himself by telling me that my horse wasstill alive, and somewhat recovered from his fatigue; but he insistedthat I should take him along with me, adding that he had once kept aMoor’s horse for four months, and when the horse had recovered and gotinto good condition, the Moor returned and claimed it, and refused togive him any reward for his trouble.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 1.—I departed from Modiboo, driving my horse before me, and inthe afternoon reached Nyamee; where I remained three days, during whichtime it rained without intermission, and with such violence that noperson could venture out of doors.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 5.—I departed from Nyamee; but the country was so deluged that Iwas frequently in danger of losing the road, and had to wade across thesavannas for miles together, knee-deep in water.  Even the corn ground,which is the driest land in the country, was so completely flooded thatmy horse twice stuck fast in the mud, and was not got out without thegreatest difficulty.</p><p> </p><p> In the evening of the same day I arrived at Nyara, where I was wellreceived by the dooty; and as the 6th was rainy I did not depart untilthe morning of the 7th; but the water had swelled to such a height, thatin many places the road was scarcely passable, and though I wadedbreast-deep across the swamps I could only reach a small village calledNemaboo, where however, for a hundred kowries, I procured from someFoulahs plenty of corn for my horse and milk for myself.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 8.—The difficulties I had experienced the day before made meanxious to engage a fellow-traveller, particularly as I was assured that,in the course of a few days, the country would be so completelyoverflowed as to render the road utterly impassable; but though I offeredtwo hundred kowries for a guide, nobody would accompany me.  However, onthe morning following, August 9th, a Moor and his wife, riding upon twobullocks, and bound for Sego with salt, passed the village, and agreed totake me along with them; but I found them of little service, for theywere wholly unacquainted with the road, and being accustomed to a sandysoil, were very bad travellers.  Instead of wading before the bullocks tofeel if the ground was solid, the woman boldly entered the first swamp,riding upon the top of the load; but when she had proceeded about twohundred yards the bullock sunk into a hole, and threw both the load andherself among the reeds.  The frightened husband stood for some timeseemingly petrified with horror, and suffered his wife to be almostdrowned before he went to her assistance.</p><p> </p><p> About sunset we reached Sibity, but the dooty received me very coolly;and when I solicited for a guide to Sansanding he told me his people wereotherwise employed.  I was shown into a damp old hut, where I passed avery uncomfortable night; for when the walls of the huts are softened bythe rain they frequently become too weak to support the weight of theroof.  I heard three huts fall during the night, and was apprehensivethat the hut I lodged in would be the fourth.  In the morning, as I wentto pull some grass for my horse, I counted fourteen huts which had fallenin this manner since the commencement of the rainy season.</p><p> </p><p> It continued to rain with great violence all the 10th; and as the dootyrefused to give me any provisions, I purchased some corn, which I dividedwith my horse.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 11.—The dooty compelled me to depart from the town, and I setout for Sansanding without any great hopes of faring better than I haddone at Sibity; for I learned, from people who came to visit me, that areport prevailed, and was universally believed, that I had come toBambarra as a spy; and as Mansong had not admitted me into his presence,the dooties of the different towns were at liberty to treat me in whatmanner they pleased.  From repeatedly hearing the same story I had nodoubt of the truth of it; but as there was no alternative I determined toproceed, and a little before sunset I arrived at Sansanding.  Myreception was what I expected.  Counti Mamadi, who had been so kind to meformerly, scarcely gave me welcome.  Every one wished to shun me; and mylandlord sent a person to inform me that a very unfavourable report wasreceived from Sego concerning me, and that he wished me to depart earlyin the morning.  About ten o’clock at night Counti Mamadi himself cameprivately to me, and informed me that Mansong had despatched a canoe toJenné to bring me back; and he was afraid I should find great difficultyin going to the west country.  He advised me therefore to depart fromSansanding before daybreak, and cautioned me against stopping at Diggani,or any town near Sego.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 12.—I departed from Sansanding, and reached Kabba in theafternoon.  As I approached the town I was surprised to see severalpeople assembled at the gate, one of whom, as I advanced, came runningtowards me, and taking my horse by the bridle, led me round the walls ofthe town, and then, pointing to the west, told me to go along, or itwould fare worse with me.  It was in vain that I represented the dangerof being benighted in the woods, exposed to the inclemency of the weatherand the fury of wild beasts.  “Go along!” was all the answer; and anumber of people coming up and urging me in the same manner, with greatearnestness, I suspected that some of the king’s messengers, who weresent in search of me, were in the town, and that these negroes, from merekindness, conducted me past it with a view to facilitate my escape.  Iaccordingly took the road for Sego, with the uncomfortable prospect ofpassing the night on the branches of a tree.  After travelling aboutthree miles, I came to a small village near the road.  The dooty wassplitting sticks by the gate, but I found I could have no admittance, andwhen I attempted to enter, he jumped up, and with the stick he held inhis hand, threatened to strike me off the horse if I presumed to advanceanother step.</p><p> </p><p> At a little distance from this village (and further from the road) isanother small one.  I conjectured that, being rather out of the commonroute, the inhabitants might have fewer objections to give me house-roomfor the night; and having crossed some cornfields, I sat down under atree by the well.  Two or three women came to draw water, and one ofthem, perceiving I was a stranger, inquired whither I was going.  I toldher I was going for Sego, but being benighted on the road, I wished tostay at the village until morning, and begged she would acquaint thedooty with my situation.  In a little time the dooty sent for me, andpermitted me to sleep in a large baloon.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 13.—About ten o’clock I reached a small village within half amile of Sego, where I endeavoured, but in vain, to procure someprovisions.  Every one seemed anxious to avoid me; and I can plainlyperceive, by the looks and behaviour of the inhabitants, that some veryunfavourable accounts had been circulated concerning me.  I was againinformed that Mansong had sent people to apprehend me, and the dooty’sson told me I had no time to lose if I wished to get safe out ofBambarra.  I now fully saw the danger of my situation, and determined toavoid Sego altogether.  I accordingly mounted my horse, and taking theroad for Diggani, travelled as fast as I could till I was out of sight ofthe villagers, when I struck to the westward, through high grass andswampy ground.  About noon I stopped under a tree to consider what courseto take, for I had now no doubt that the Moors and slatees hadmisinformed the king respecting the object of my mission, and that peoplewere absolutely in search of me to convey me a prisoner to Sego.Sometimes I had thoughts of swimming my horse across the Niger, and goingto the southward for Cape Coast, but reflecting that I had ten days totravel before I should reach Kong, and afterwards an extensive country totraverse, inhabited by various nations with whose language and manners Iwas totally unacquainted, I relinquished this scheme, and judged that Ishould better answer the purpose of my mission by proceeding to thewestward along the Niger, endeavouring to ascertain how far the river wasnavigable in that direction.  Having resolved upon this course, Iproceeded accordingly, and a little before sunset arrived at a Foulahvillage called Sooboo, where, for two hundred kowries, I procured lodgingfor the night.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 14.—I continued my course along the bank of the river, through apopulous and well-cultivated country.  I passed a walled town calledKamalia {35} without stopping, and at noon rode through a large towncalled Samee, where there happened to be a market, and a number of peopleassembled in an open place in the middle of the town, selling cattle,cloth, corn, &c.  I rode through the midst of them without being muchobserved, every one taking me for a Moor.  In the afternoon I arrived ata small village called Binni, where I agreed with the dooty’s son, forone hundred kowries, to allow me to stay for the night; but when thedooty returned, he insisted that I should instantly leave the place, andif his wife and son had not interceded for me, I must have complied.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 15.—About nine o’clock I passed a large town called Sai, whichvery much excited my curiosity.  It is completely surrounded by two verydeep trenches, at about two hundred yards distant from the walls.  On thetop of the trenches are a number of square towers, and the whole has theappearance of a regular fortification.</p><p> </p><p> About noon I came to the village of Kaimoo, situated upon the bank of theriver, and as the corn I had purchased at Sibili was exhausted, Iendeavoured to purchase a fresh supply, but was informed that corn wasbecome very scarce all over the country, and though I offered fiftykowries for a small quantity, no person would sell me any.  As I wasabout to depart, however, one of the villagers (who probably mistook mefor some Moorish shereef) brought me some as a present, only desiring meto bestow my blessing upon him, which I did in plain English, and hereceived it with a thousand acknowledgments.  Of this present I made mydinner, and it was the third successive day that I had subsisted entirelyupon raw corn.</p><p> </p><p> In the evening I arrived at a small village called Song, the surlyinhabitants of which would not receive me, nor so much as permit me toenter the gate; but as lions were very numerous in this neighbourhood,and I had frequently, in the course of the day, observed the impressionof their feet on the road, I resolved to stay in the vicinity of thevillage.  Having collected some grass for my horse, I accordingly laydown under a tree by the gate.  About ten o’clock I heard the hollow roarof a lion at no great distance, and attempted to open the gate, but thepeople from within told me that no person must attempt to enter the gatewithout the dooty’s permission.  I begged them to inform the dooty that alion was approaching the village, and I hoped he would allow me to comewithin the gate.  I waited for an answer to this message with greatanxiety, for the lion kept prowling round the village, and once advancedso very near me that I heard him rustling among the grass, and climbedthe tree for safety.  About midnight the dooty, with some of his people,opened the gate, and desired me to come in.  They were convinced, theysaid, that I was not a Moor, for no Moor ever waited any time at the gateof a village without cursing the inhabitants.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 16.—About ten o’clock I passed a considerable town, with amosque, called Jabbee.  Here the country begins to rise into hills, and Icould see the summits of high mountains to the westward.  About noon Istopped at a small village near Yamina, where I purchased some corn, anddried my papers and clothes.</p><p> </p><p> The town of Yamina at a distance has a very fine appearance.  It coversnearly the same extent of ground as Sansanding, but having been plunderedby Daisy, king of Kaarta, about four years ago, it has not yet resumedits former prosperity, nearly one-half of the town being nothing but aheap of ruins.  However, it is still a considerable place, and is so muchfrequented by the Moors that I did not think it safe to lodge in it, butin order to satisfy myself respecting its population and extent, Iresolved to ride through it, in doing which I observed a great many Moorssitting upon the bentangs, and other places of public resort.  Everybodylooked at me with astonishment, but as I rode briskly along they had notime to ask questions.</p><p> </p><p> I arrived in the evening at Farra, a walled village, where, without muchdifficulty, I procured a lodging for the night.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 17.—Early in the morning I pursued my journey, and at eighto’clock passed a considerable town called Balaba, after which the roadquits the plain, and stretches along the side of the hill.  I passed inthe course of this day the ruins of three towns, the inhabitants of whichwere all carried away by Daisy, king of Kaarta, on the same day that hetook and plundered Yamina.  Near one of these ruins I climbed atamarind-tree, but found the fruit quite green and sour, and the prospectof the country was by no means inviting, for the high grass and bushesseemed completely to obstruct the road, and the low lands were all soflooded by the river, that the Niger had the appearance of an extensivelake.  In the evening I arrived at Kanika, where the dooty, who wassitting upon an elephant’s hide at the gate, received me kindly, and gaveme for supper some milk and meal, which I considered (as to a person inmy situation it really was) a very great luxury.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 18.—By mistake I took the wrong road, and did not discover myerror until I had travelled nearly four miles, when, coming to aneminence, I observed the Niger considerably to the left.  Directing mycourse towards it, I travelled through long grass and bushes with greatdifficulty until two o’clock in thee afternoon, when I came to acomparatively small but very rapid river, which I took at first for acreek, or one of the streams of the Niger.  However, after I had examinedit with more attention, I was convinced that it was a distinct river, andas the road evidently crossed it (for I could see the pathway on theopposite side), I sat down upon the bank in hopes that some travellermight arrive who would give me the necessary information concerning thefording-place—for the banks were so covered with reeds and bushes that itwould have been almost impossible to land on the other side, except atthe pathway, which, on account of the rapidity of the stream, it seemedvery difficult to reach.  No traveller however arriving, and there beinga great appearance of rain, I examined the grass and bushes for some wayup the bank, and determined upon entering the river considerably abovethe pathway, in order to reach the other side before the stream had sweptme too far down.  With this view I fastened my clothes upon the saddle,and was standing up to the neck in water, pulling my horse by the bridleto make him follow me, where a man came accidentally to the place, andseeing me in the water, called to me with great vehemence to come out.The alligators, he said, would devour both me and my horse, if weattempted to swim over.  When I had got out, the stranger, who had neverbefore seen a European, seemed wonderfully surprised.  He twice put hishand to his mouth, exclaiming, in a low tone of voice, “God preserve me!who is this?” but when he heard me speak the Bambarra tongue, and foundthat I was going the same way as himself, he promised to assist me incrossing the river, the name of which he said was Frina.  He then went alittle way along the bank, and called to some person, who answered fromthe other side.  In a short time a canoe with two boys came paddling fromamong the reeds.  These boys agreed for fifty kowries to transport me andmy horse over the river, which was effected without much difficulty, andI arrived in the evening at Taffara, a walled town, and soon discoveredthat the language of the natives was improved from the corrupted dialectof Bambarra to the pure Mandingo.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XVIII.DESPAIRING THOUGHTS—ARRIVAL AT SIBIDOOLOO.</p><p> </p><p> ON my arrival at Taffara I inquired for the dooty, but was informed thathe had died a few days before my arrival, and that there was at thatmoment a meeting of the chief men for electing another, there being somedispute about the succession.  It was probably owing to this unsettledstate of the town that I experienced such a want of hospitality in it,for though I informed the inhabitants that I should only remain with themfor one night, and assured them that Mansong had given me some kowries topay for my lodging, yet no person invited me to come in, and I was forcedto sit alone under the bentang-tree, exposed to the rain and wind of atornado, which lasted with great violence until midnight.  At this timethe stranger who had assisted me in crossing the river paid me a visit,and observing that I had not found a lodging, invited me to take part ofhis supper, which he had brought to the door of his hut; for, being aguest himself, he could not, without his landlord’s consent, invite me tocome in.  After this I slept upon some wet grass in the corner of acourt.  My horse fared still worse than myself, the corn I purchasedbeing all expended, and I could not procure a supply.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 20.—I passed the town of Jaba, and stopped a few minutes at avillage called Somino, where I begged and obtained some coarse food,which the natives prepare from the husks of corn, and call _boo_.  Abouttwo o’clock I came to the village of Sooha, and endeavoured to purchasesome corn from the dooty, who was sitting by the gate, but withoutsuccess.  I then requested a little food by way of charity, but was toldhe had none to spare.  Whilst I was examining the countenance of thisinhospitable old man, and endeavouring to find out the cause of thesullen discontent which was visible in his eye, he called to a slave whowas working in the cornfield at a little distance, and ordered him tobring his hoe along with him.  The dooty then told him to dig a hole inthe ground, pointing to a spot at no great distance.  The slave, with hishoe, began to dig a pit in the earth, and the dooty, who appeared to be aman of very fretful disposition, kept muttering and talking to himselfuntil the pit was almost finished, when he repeatedly pronounced thewords “_dankatoo_” (“good for nothing”)—“_jankra lemen_” (“a realplague”)—which expressions I thought could be applied to nobody butmyself; and as the pit had very much the appearance of a grave, I thoughtit prudent to mount my horse, and was about to decamp, when the slave,who had before gone into the village, to my surprise returned with thecorpse of a boy about nine or ten years of age, quite naked.  The negrocarried the body by a leg and an arm, and threw it into the pit with asavage indifference which I had never before seen.  As he covered thebody with earth, the dooty often expressed himself, “_naphula attiniata_”(“money lost”), whence I concluded that the boy had been one of hisslaves.</p><p> </p><p> Departing from this shocking scene, I travelled by the side of the riveruntil sunset, when I came to Koolikorro, a considerable town, and a greatmarket for salt.  Here I took up my lodging at the house of a Bambarran,who had formerly been the slave of a Moor, and in that character hadtravelled to Aroan, Towdinni, and many other places in the Great Desert;but turning Mussulman, and his master dying at Jenné, he obtained hisfreedom and settled at this place, where he carries on a considerabletrade in salt, cotton cloth, &c.  His knowledge of the world had notlessened that superstitious confidence in saphies and charms which he hadimbibed in his earlier years, for when he heard that I was a Christian,he immediately thought of procuring a saphie, and for this purposebrought out his _walha_, or writing-board, assuring me that he woulddress me a supper of rice if I would write him a saphie to protect himfrom wicked men.  The proposal was of too great consequence to me to berefused.  I therefore wrote the board full, from top to bottom, on bothsides; and my landlord, to be certain of having the whole force of thecharm, washed the writing from the board into a calabash with a littlewater, and having said a few prayers over it, drank this powerfuldraught; after which, lest a single word should escape, he licked theboard until it was quite dry.  A saphie-writer was a man of too greatconsequence to be long concealed; the important information was carriedto the dooty, who sent his son with half a sheet of writing-paper,desiring me to write him a _naphula saphie_ (a charm to procure wealth).He brought me, as a present, some meal and milk, and when I had finishedthe saphie, and read it to him with an audible voice, he seemed highlysatisfied with his bargain, and promised to bring me in the morning somemilk for my breakfast.  When I had finished my supper of rice and salt, Ilaid myself down upon a bullock’s hide, and slept very quietly untilmorning, this being the first good meal and refreshing sleep that I hadenjoyed for a long time.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 21.—At daybreak I departed from Koolikorro, and about noonpassed the villages of Kayoo and Toolumbo.  In the afternoon I arrived atMarraboo, a large town, and, like Koolikorro, famous for its trade insalt.  I was conducted to the house of a Kaartan, of the tribe of Jower,by whom I was well received.  This man had acquired a considerableproperty in the slave-trade, and, from his hospitality to strangers, wascalled, by way of pre-eminence, _jatee_ (the landlord), and his house wasa sort of public inn for all travellers.  Those who had money were welllodged, for they always made him some return for his kindness, but thosewho had nothing to give were content to accept whatever he thoughtproper; and as I could not rank myself among the moneyed men, I was happyto take up my lodging in the same but with seven poor fellows who hadcome from Kancaba in a canoe.  But our landlord sent us some victuals.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 22—One of the landlord’s servants went with me a little way fromthe town to show me what road to take, but, whether from ignorance ordesign I know not, he directed me wrong, and I did not discover mymistake until the day was far advanced, when, coming to a deep creek, Ihad some thoughts of turning back, but as by that means I foresaw that Icould not possibly reach Bammakoo before night, I resolved to cross it,and, leading my horse close to the brink, I went behind him and pushedhim headlong into the water, and then taking the bridle in my teeth, swamover to the other side.  About four o’clock in the afternoon, havingaltered my course from the river towards the mountains, I came to a smallpathway which led to a village called Frookaboo, where I slept.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 23—Early in the morning I set out for Bammakoo, at which place Iarrived about five o’clock in the afternoon.  I had heard Bammakoo muchtalked of as a great market for salt, and I felt rather disappointed tofind it only a middling town, not quite so large as Marraboo; however,the smallness of its size is more than compensated by the richness of itsinhabitants, for when the Moors bring their salt through Kaarta orBambarra, they constantly rest a few days at this place, and the negromerchants here, who are well acquainted with the value of salt indifferent kingdoms, frequently purchase by wholesale, and retail it togreat advantage.  Here I lodged at the house of a Serawoolli negro, andwas visited by a number of Moors.  They spoke very good Mandingo, andwere more civil to me than their countrymen had been.  One of them hadtravelled to Rio Grande, and spoke very highly of the Christians.  Hesent me in the evening some boiled rice and milk.  I now endeavoured toprocure information concerning my route to the westward from a slavemerchant who had resided some years on the Gambia.  He gave me someimperfect account of the distance, and enumerated the names of a greatmany places that lay in the way, but withal told me that the road wasimpassable at this season of the year: he was even afraid, he said, thatI should find great difficulty in proceeding any farther; as the roadcrossed the Joliba at a town about half a day’s journey to the westwardof Bammakoo, and there being no canoes at that place large enough toreceive my horse, I could not possibly get him over for some months tocome.  This was an obstruction of a very serious nature; but as I had nomoney to maintain myself even for a few days, I resolved to push on, andif I could not convey my horse across the river, to abandon him, and swimover myself.  In thoughts of this nature I passed the night, and in themorning consulted with my landlord how I should surmount the presentdifficulty.  He informed me that one road still remained, which wasindeed very rocky, and scarcely passable for horses, but that if I had aproper guide over the hills to a town called Sibidooloo, he had no doubtbut with patience and caution I might travel forwards through Manding.  Iimmediately applied to the dooty, and was informed that a _jilli kea_(singing man) was about to depart for Sibidooloo, and would show me theroad over the hills.  With this man, who undertook to be my conductor, Itravelled up a rocky glen about two miles, when we came to a smallvillage, and here my musical fellow-traveller found out that he hadbrought me the wrong road.  He told me that the horse-road lay on theother side of the hill, and throwing his drum on his back, mounted up therocks where, indeed, no horse could follow him, leaving me to admire hisagility, and trace out a road for myself.  As I found it impossible toproceed, I rode back to the level ground, and directing my course to theeastward, came about noon to another glen, and discovered a path on whichI observed the marks of horses’ feet.  Following this path I came in ashort time to some shepherds’ huts, where I was informed that I was inthe right road, but that I could not possibly reach Sibidooloo beforenight.</p><p> </p><p> A little before sunset I descended on the north-west side of this ridgeof hills, and as I was looking about for a convenient tree under which topass the night (for I had no hopes of reaching any town) I descended intoa delightful valley, and soon afterwards arrived at a romantic villagecalled Kooma.  This village is surrounded by a high wall, and is the soleproperty of a Mandingo merchant, who fled hither with his family during aformer war.  The adjacent fields yield him plenty of corn, his cattleroam at large in the valley, and the rocky hills secure him from thedepredations of war.  In this obscure retreat he is seldom visited bystrangers, but whenever this happens he makes the weary travellerwelcome.  I soon found myself surrounded by a circle of the harmlessvillagers.  They asked a thousand questions about my country, and, inreturn for my information, brought corn and milk for myself, and grassfor my horse, kindled a fire in the hut where I was to sleep, andappeared very anxious to serve me.</p><p> </p><p> _August_ 25.—I departed from Kooma, accompanied by two shepherds who weregoing towards Sibidooloo.  The road was very steep and rocky, and as myhorse had hurt his feet much in coming from Bammakoo, he travelled slowlyand with great difficulty, for in many places the ascent was so sharp,and the declivities so great, that if he had made one false step he mustinevitably have been dashed to pieces.  The shepherds being anxious toproceed, gave themselves little trouble about me or my horse, and keptwalking on at a considerable distance.  It was about eleven o’clock, as Istopped to drink a little water at a rivulet (my companions being near aquarter of a mile before me), that I heard some people calling to eachother, and presently a loud screaming, as from a person in greatdistress.  I immediately conjectured that a lion had taken one of theshepherds, and mounted my horse to have a better view of what hadhappened.  The noise, however, ceased, and I rode slowly towards theplace from whence I thought it had proceeded, calling out, but withoutreceiving any answer.  In a little time, however, I perceived one of theshepherds lying among the long grass near the road, and though I couldsee no blood upon him, I concluded he was dead.  But when I came close tohim, he whispered to me to stop, telling me that a party of armed men hadseized upon his companion, and shot two arrows at himself as he wasmaking his escape.  I stopped to consider what course to take, andlooking round, saw at a little distance a man sitting upon the stump of atree.  I distinguished also the heads of six or seven more, sitting amongthe grass, with muskets in their hands.  I had now no hopes of escaping,and therefore determined to ride forward towards them.  As I approachedthem, I was in hopes they were elephant-hunters; and by way of openingthe conversation inquired if they had shot anything, but withoutreturning an answer one of them ordered me to dismount, and then, as ifrecollecting himself, waved with his hand for me to proceed.  Iaccordingly rode past, and had with some difficulty crossed a deeprivulet, when I heard somebody holloa, and looking behind, saw those Ihad taken for elephant-hunters running after me, and calling out to me toturn back.  I stopped until they were all come up, when they informed methat the king of the Foulahs had sent them on purpose to bring me, myhorse, and everything that belonged to me, to Fooladoo, and thattherefore I must turn back and go along with them.  Without hesitating amoment, I turned round and followed them, and we travelled togethernearly a quarter of a mile without exchanging a word; when, coming to adark place in a wood, one of them said in the Mandingo language, “Thisplace will do,” and immediately snatched my hat from my head.  Though Iwas by no means free of apprehension, yet I resolved to show as few signsof fear as possible, and therefore told them that unless my hat wasreturned to me I should proceed no farther.  But before I had time toreceive an answer another drew his knife, and seizing upon a metal buttonwhich remained upon my waistcoat, cut it off and put it into his pocket.Their intentions were obvious, and I thought that the easier they werepermitted to rob me of everything, the less I had to fear.  I thereforeallowed them to search my pockets without resistance, and examine everypart of my apparel, which they did with the most scrupulous exactness.But observing that I had one waistcoat under another, they insisted thatI should cast them both off; and at last, to make sure work, theystripped me quite naked.  Even my half-boots (though the sole of one ofthem was tied on to my foot with a broken bridle rein) were minutelyinspected.  Whilst they were examining the plunder, I begged them, withgreat earnestness, to return my pocket-compass; but when I pointed it outto them as it was lying on the ground, one of the banditti, thinking Iwas about to take it up, cocked his musket, and swore that he would layme dead upon the spot if I presumed to put my hand upon it.  After this,some of them went away with my horse, and the remainder stood consideringwhether they should leave me quite naked, or allow me something toshelter me from the sun.  Humanity at last prevailed; they returned methe worst of the two shirts and a pair of trousers; and, as they wentaway, one of them threw back my hat, in the crown of which I kept mymemorandums, and this was probably the reason they did not wish to keepit.  After they were gone, I sat for some time looking round me withinamazement and terror.  Whichever way I turned, nothing appeared butdanger and difficulty.  I saw myself in the midst of a vast wilderness,in the depth of the rainy season—naked and alone, surrounded by savageanimals, and men still more savage.  I was five hundred miles from thenearest European settlement.  All these circumstances crowded at once onmy recollection, and I confess that my spirits began to fail me.  Iconsidered my fate as certain, and that I had no alternative but to liedown and perish.  The influence of religion, however, aided and supportedme.  I reflected that no human prudence or foresight could possibly haveaverted my present sufferings.  I was indeed a stranger in a strangeland, yet I was still under the protecting eye of that Providence who hascondescended to call Himself the stranger’s Friend.  At this moment,painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small mossin fructification irresistibly caught my eye.  I mention this to showfrom what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes deriveconsolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top ofone of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation ofits roots, leaves, and capsula without admiration.  Can that Being,thought I, who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in thisobscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance,look within unconcern upon the situation and sufferings of creaturesformed after His own image?  Surely not!  Reflections like these wouldnot allow me to despair.  I started up, and, disregarding both hunger andfatigue, travelled forwards, assured that relief was at hand; and I wasnot disappointed.  In a short time I came to a small village, at theentrance of which I overtook the two shepherds who had come with me fromKooma.  They were much surprised to see me; for they said they neverdoubted that the Foulahs, when they had robbed, had murdered me.Departing from this village, we travelled over several rocky ridges, andat sunset arrived at Sibidooloo, the frontier town of the kingdom ofManding.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XIX.ILLNESS AT KAMALIA AND KINDNESS OF THE NATIVES.</p><p> </p><p> THE town of Sibidooloo is situated in a fertile valley, surrounded withhigh, rocky hills.  It is scarcely accessible for horses, and during thefrequent wars between the Bambarrans, Foulahs, and Mandingoes has neveronce been plundered by an enemy.  When I entered the town, the peoplegathered round me and followed me into the baloon, where I was presentedto the dooty or chief man, who is here called mansa, which usuallysignifies king.  Nevertheless, it appeared to me that the government ofManding was a sort of republic, or rather an oligarchy—every town havinga particular mansa, and the chief power of the state, in the last resort,being lodged in the assembly of the whole body.  I related to the mansathe circumstances of my having been robbed of my horse and apparel; andmy story was confirmed by the two shepherds.  He continued smoking hispipe all the time I was speaking; but I had no sooner finished, than,taking his pipe from his mouth, and tossing up the sleeve of his cloakwith an indignant air—“Sit down,” said he; “you shall have everythingrestored to you; I have sworn it:”—and then turning to an attendant,“Give the white man,” said he, “a draught of water; and with the firstlight of the morning go over the hills, and inform the dooty of Bammakoothat a poor white man, the king of Bambarra’s stranger, has been robbedby the king of Fooladoo’s people.”</p><p> </p><p> I little expected, in my forlorn condition, to meet with a man who couldthus feel for my sufferings.  I heartily thanked the mansa for hiskindness, and accepted his invitation to remain with him until the returnof the messenger.  I was conducted into a hut and had some victuals sentme, but the crowd of people which assembled to see me—all of whomcommiserated my misfortunes, and vented imprecations against theFoulahs—prevented me from sleeping until past midnight.  Two days Iremained without hearing any intelligence of my horse or clothes; and asthere was at this time a great scarcity of provisions, approaching evento famine, all over this part of the country, I was unwilling to trespassany farther on the mansa’s generosity, and begged permission to depart tothe next village.  Finding me very anxious to proceed, he told me that Imight go as far as a town called Wonda, where he hoped I would remain afew days until I heard some account of my horse, etc.</p><p> </p><p> I departed accordingly on the next morning, the 28th, and stopped at somesmall villages for refreshment.  I was presented at one of them with adish which I had never before seen.  It was composed of the blossoms or_antheræ_ of the maize, stewed in milk and water.  It is eaten only intime of great scarcity.  On the 30th, about noon, I arrived at Wonda, asmall town with a mosque, and surrounded by a high wall.  The mansa, whowas a Mohammedan, acted in two capacities—as chief magistrate of thetown, and schoolmaster to the children.  He kept his school in an openshed, where I was desired to take up my lodging until some account shouldarrive from Sibidooloo concerning my horse and clothes; for though thehorse was of little use to me, yet the few clothes were essential, Thelittle raiment upon me could neither protect me from the sun by day, northe dews and mosquitoes by night: indeed, my shirt was not only worn thinlike a piece of muslin, but withal so very dirty that I was happy toembrace an opportunity of washing it, which having done, and spread itupon a bush, I sat down naked in the shade until it was dry.</p><p> </p><p> Ever since the commencement of the rainy season my health had beengreatly on the decline.  I had often been affected with slight paroxysmsof fever; and from the time of leaving Bammakoo the symptoms hadconsiderably increased.  As I was sitting in the manner described, thefever returned with such violence that it very much alarmed me; the moreso as I had no medicine to stop its progress, nor any hope of obtainingthat care and attention which my situation required.</p><p> </p><p> I remained at Wonda nine days, during which time I experienced theregular return of the fever every day.  And though I endeavoured as muchas possible to conceal my distress from my landlord, and frequently laydown the whole day out of his sight, in a field of corn—conscious howburdensome I was to him and his family in a time of such greatscarcity—yet I found that he was apprised of my situation; and onemorning, as I feigned to be asleep by the fire, he observed to his wifethat they were likely to find me a very troublesome and chargeable guest;for that, in my present sickly state, they should be obliged, for thesake of their good name, to maintain me until I recovered or died.</p><p> </p><p> The scarcity of provisions was certainly felt at this time most severelyby the poor people, as the following circumstance most painfullyconvinced me:—Every evening during my stay I observed five or six womencome to the mansa’s house, and receive each of them a certain quantity ofcorn.  As I knew how valuable this article was at this juncture, Iinquired of the mansa whether he maintained these poor women from purebounty, or expected a return when the harvest should be gathered in.“Observe that boy,” said he (pointing to a fine child about five years ofage); “his mother has sold him to me for forty days’ provision forherself and the rest of her family.  I have bought another boy in thesame manner.”  Good God! thought I, what must a mother suffer before shesells her own child!  I could not get this melancholy subject out of mymind; and the next night, when the women returned for their allowance, Idesired the boy to point out to me his mother, which he did.  She wasmuch emaciated, but had nothing cruel or savage in her countenance; andwhen she had received her corn, she came and talked to her son with asmuch cheerfulness as if he had still been under her care.</p><p> </p><p> _September_ 6.—Two people arrived from Sibidooloo, bringing with them myhorse and clothes; but I found that my pocket-compass was broken topieces.  This was a great loss, which I could not repair.</p><p> </p><p> _September_ 7.—As my horse was grazing near the brink of a well theground gave way and he fell in.  The well was about ten feet in diameter,and so very deep that when I saw my horse snorting in the water I thoughtit was impossible to save him.  The inhabitants of the village, however,immediately assembled, and having tied together a number of withes, {58}they lowered a man down into the well, who fastened those withes roundthe body of the horse; and the people, having first drawn up the man,took hold of the withes and, to my surprise, pulled the horse out withthe greatest facility.  The poor animal was now reduced to a mereskeleton, and the roads were scarcely passable, being either very rocky,or else full of mud and water.  I therefore found it impracticable totravel with him any farther, and was happy to leave him in the hands ofone who, I thought, would take care of him.  I accordingly presented himto my landlord, and desired him to send my saddle and bridle as a presentto the mansa of Sibidooloo, being the only return I could make him forhaving taken so much trouble in procuring my horse and clothes.</p><p> </p><p> I now thought it necessary, sick as I was, to take leave of my hospitablelandlord.  On the morning of September 8th, when I was about to depart,he presented me with his spear, as a token of remembrance, and a leatherbag to contain my clothes.  Having converted my half-boots into sandals,I travelled with more ease, and slept that night at a village calledBallanti.  On the 9th I reached Nemacoo; but the mansa of the villagethought fit to make me sup upon the chameleon’s dish.  By way of apology,however, he assured me the next morning that the scarcity of corn wassuch that he could not possibly allow me any.  I could not accuse him ofunkindness, as all the people actually appeared to be starving.</p><p> </p><p> _September_ 10.—It rained hard all day, and the people kept themselves intheir huts.  In the afternoon I was visited by a negro, named Modi LeminaTaura, a great trader, who, suspecting my distress, brought me somevictuals, and promised to conduct me to his own house at Kinyeto the dayfollowing.</p><p> </p><p> _September_ 11.—I departed from Nemacoo, and arrived at Kinyeto in theevening; but having hurt my ankle in the way, it swelled and inflamed somuch that I could neither walk nor set my foot to the ground the next daywithout great pain.  My landlord, observing this, kindly invited me tostop with him a few days, and I accordingly remained at his house untilthe 14th, by which the I felt much relieved, and could walk with the helpof a staff.  I now set out, thanking my landlord for his great care andattention; and being accompanied by a young man who was travelling thesame way, I proceeded for Jerijang, a beautiful and well-cultivateddistrict, the mansa of which is reckoned the most powerful chief of anyin Manding.</p><p> </p><p> On the 15th I reached Dosita, a large town, where I stayed one day onaccount of the rain; but I continued very sickly, and was slightlydelirious in the night.  On the 17th I set out for Mansia, a considerabletown, where small quantities of gold are collected.  The road led over ahigh, rocky hill, and my strength and spirits were so much exhausted thatbefore I could reach the top of the hill I was forced to lie down threetimes, being very faint and sickly.  I reached Mansia in the afternoon.The mansa of this town had the character of being very inhospitable; he,however, sent me a little corn for my supper, but demanded something inreturn; and when I assured him that I had nothing of value in mypossession, he told me (as if in jest) that my white skin should notdefend me if I told him lies.  He then showed me the hut wherein I was tosleep, but took away my spear, saying that it should be returned to me inthe morning.  This trifling circumstance, when joined to the character Ihad heard of the man, made me rather suspicious of him, and I privatelydesired one of the inhabitants of the place, who had a bow and a quiver,to sleep in the same hunt with me.  About midnight I heard somebodyapproach the door, and, observing the moonlight strike suddenly into thehut, I started up and saw a man stepping cautiously over the threshold.I immediately snatched up the negro’s bow and quiver, the rattling ofwhich made the man withdraw; and my companion, looking out, assured methat it was the mansa himself, and advised me to keep awake until themorning.  I closed the door, and placed a large piece of wood behind it,and was wondering at this unexpected visit, when somebody pressed so hardagainst the door that the negro could scarcely keep it shut; but when Icalled to him to open the door, the intruder ran off as before.</p><p> </p><p> _September_ 16.—As soon as it was light the negro, at my request, went tothe mansa’s house and brought away my spear.  He told me that the mansawas asleep, and lest this inhospitable chief should devise means todetain me, he advised me to set out before he was awake, which Iimmediately did, and about two o’clock reached Kamalia, a small townsituated at the bottom of some rocky hills, where the inhabitants collectgold in considerable quantities.</p><p> </p><p> On my arrival at Kamalia I was conducted to the house of a bushreen namedKarfa Taura, the brother of him to whose hospitality I was indebted atKinyeto.  He was collecting a coffle of slaves, with a view to sell themto the Europeans on the Gambia as soon as the rains should be over.  Ifound him sitting in his baloon, surrounded by several slatees whoproposed to join the coffle.  He was reading to them from an Arabic book,and inquired with a smile if I understood it.  Being answered in thenegative, he desired one of the slatees to fetch the little curious bookwhich had been brought from the west country.  On opening this smallvolume I was surprised and delighted to find it our Book of CommonPrayer, and Karfa expressed great joy to hear that I could read it; forsome of the slatees, who had seen the Europeans upon the coast, observingthe colour of my skin (which was now become very yellow from sickness),my long beard, ragged clothes, and extreme poverty, were unwilling toadmit that I was a white man, and told Karfa that they suspected I wassome Arab in disguise.  Karfa, however, perceiving that I could read thisbook, had no doubt concerning me, and kindly promised me every assistancein his power.  At the same time he informed me that it was impossible tocross the Jallonka wilderness for many months yet to come, as no lessthan eight rapid rivers, he said, lay in the way.  He added that heintended to set out himself for Gambia as soon as the rivers werefordable and the grass burnt, and advised me to stay and accompany him.He remarked that when a caravan of the natives could not travel throughthe country it was idle for a single white man to attempt it.  I readilyadmitted that such an attempt was an act of rashness, but I assured himthat I had no alternative, for, having no money to support myself, I musteither beg my subsistence by travelling from place to place, or perishfor want.  Karfa now looked at me with great earnestness, and inquired ifI could eat the common victuals of the country, assuring me he had neverbefore seen a white man.  He added that if I would remain with him untilthe rains were over, he would give me plenty of victuals in the meantime,and a hut to sleep in; and that after he had conducted me in safety tothe Gambia, I might then make him what return I thought proper.  I askedhim if the value of one prime slave would satisfy him.  He answered inthe affirmative, and immediately ordered one of the huts to be swept formy accommodation.  Thus was I delivered, by the friendly care of thisbenevolent negro, from a situation truly deplorable.  Distress and faminepressed hard upon me.  I had before me the gloomy wilds of Jallonkadoo,where the traveller sees no habitation for five successive days.  I hadobserved at a distance the rapid course of the river Kokoro.  I hadalmost marked out the place where I was doomed, I thought, to perish,when this friendly negro stretched out his hospitable hand for my relief.</p><p> </p><p> In the hut which was appropriated for me I was provided with a mat tosleep on, an earthen jar for holding water, and a small calabash to drinkout of; and Karfa sent me, from his own dwelling, two meals a day, andordered his slaves to supply me with firewood and water.  But I foundthat neither the kindness of Karfa nor any sort of accommodation couldput a stop to the fever which weakened me, and which became every daymore alarming.  I endeavoured as much as possible to conceal my distress;but on the third day after my arrival, as I was going with Karfa to visitsome of his friends, I found myself so faint that I could scarcely walk,and before we reached the place I staggered and fell into a pit, fromwhich the clay had been taken to build one of the huts.  Karfaendeavoured to console me with the hopes of a speedy recovery, assuringme that if I would not walk out in the wet I should soon be well.  Idetermined to follow his advice, and confine myself to my hut, but wasstill tormented with the fever, and my health continued to be in a veryprecarious state for five ensuing weeks.  Sometimes I could crawl out ofthe hut, and sit a few hours in the open air; at other times I was unableto rise, and passed the lingering hours in a very gloomy and solitarymanner.  I was seldom visited by any person except my benevolentlandlord, who came daily to inquire after my health.</p><p> </p><p> When the rains became less frequent, and the country began to grow dry,the fever left me, but in so debilitated a condition that I couldscarcely stand upright; and it was with great difficulty that I couldcarry my mat to the shade of a tamarind-tree, at a short distance, toenjoy the refreshing smell of the cornfields, and delight my eyes with aprospect of the country.  I had the pleasure at length to find myself ina state of convalescence, towards which the benevolent and simple mannersof the negroes, and the perusal of Karfa’s little volume, greatlycontributed.</p><p> </p><p> In the meantime many of the slatees who reside at Kamalia having spentall their money, and become in a great measure dependent upon Karfa’shospitality, beheld me with an eye of envy, and invented many ridiculousand trifling stories to lessen me in Karfa’s esteem.  And in thebeginning of December a Serawoolli slatee, with five slaves, arrived fromSego; this man, too, spread a number of malicious reports concerning me,but Karfa paid no attention to them, and continued to show me the samekindness as formerly.  As I was one day conversing with the slaves whichthis slatee had brought, one of them begged me to give him some victuals.I told him I was a stranger, and had none to give.  He replied, “I gaveyou victuals when you were hungry.  Have you forgot the man who broughtyou milk at Karrankalla?  But,” added he with a sigh, “_the irons werenot then upon my legs_!”  I immediately recollected him, and begged someground nuts from Karfa to give him, as a return for his former kindness.</p><p> </p><p> In the beginning of December, Karfa proposed to complete his purchase ofslaves, and for this purpose collected all the debts which were owing tohim in his own country; and on the 19th, being accompanied by threeslatees, he departed for Kancaba, a large town on the banks of the Nigerand a great slave-market.  Most of the slaves who are sold at Kancabacome from Bambarra; for Mansong, to avoid the expense and danger ofkeeping all his prisoners at Sego, commonly sends them in small partiesto be sold at the different trading towns; and as Kancaba is muchresorted to by merchants it is always well supplied with slaves, whichare sent thither up the Niger in canoes.  When Karfa departed fromKamalia he proposed to return in the course of a month, and during hisabsence I was left to the care of a good old bushreen, who acted asschoolmaster to the young people of Kamalia.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XX.NEGRO CUSTOMS.</p><p> </p><p> THE whole of my route, both in going and returning, having been confinedto a tract of country bounded nearly by the 12th and 15th parallels oflatitude, the reader must imagine that I found the climate in most placesextremely hot, but nowhere did I feel the heat so intense and oppressiveas in the camp at Benowm, of which mention has been made in a formerplace.  In some parts, where the country ascends into hills, the air isat all times, comparatively cool; yet none of the districts which Itraversed could properly be called mountainous.  About the middle of Junethe hot and sultry atmosphere is agitated by violent gusts of wind(called tornadoes), accompanied with thunder and rain.  These usher inwhat is denominated “the rainy season,” which continues until the monthof November.  During this time the diurnal rains are very heavy, and theprevailing winds are from the south-west.  The termination of the rainyseason is likewise attended with violent tornadoes, after which the windshifts to the north-east, and continues to blow from that quarter duringthe rest of the year.</p><p> </p><p> When the wind sets in from the north-east it produces a wonderful changein the face of the country.  The grass soon becomes dry and withered, therivers subside very rapidly, and many of the trees shed their leaves.About this period is commonly felt the _harmattan_, a dry and parchingwind blowing from the north-east, and accompanied by a thick smoky haze,through which the sun appears of a dull red colour.  This wind in passingover the great desert of Sahara acquires a very strong attraction forhumidity, and parches up everything exposed to its current.  It is,however, reckoned very salutary, particularly to Europeans, who generallyrecover their health during its continuance.  I experienced immediaterelief from sickness, both at Dr. Laidley’s and at Kamalia, during theharmattan.  Indeed, the air during the rainy season is so loaded withmoisture that clothes, shoes, trunks, and everything that is not close tothe fire becomes damp and mouldy, and the inhabitants may be said to livein a sort of vapour-bath; but this dry wind braces up the solids, whichwere before relaxed, gives a cheerful flow of spirits, and is evenpleasant to respiration.  Its ill effects are, that it produces chaps inthe lips, and afflicts many of the natives with sore eyes.</p><p> </p><p> Whenever the grass is sufficiently dry the negroes set it on fire; but inLudamar and other Moorish countries this practice is not allowed, for itis upon the withered stubble that the Moors feed their cattle until thereturn of the rains.  The burning the grass in Manding exhibits a sceneof terrific grandeur.  In the middle of the night I could see the plainsand mountains, as far as my eye could reach, variegated with lines offire, and the light, reflected on the sky, made the heavens appear in ablaze.  In the daytime pillars of smoke were seen in every direction,while the birds of prey were observed hovering round the conflagration,and pouncing down upon the snakes, lizards, and other reptiles whichattempted to escape from the flames.  This annual burning is soonfollowed by a fresh and sweet verdure, and the country is therebyrendered more healthful and pleasant.</p><p> </p><p> Of the most remarkable and important of the vegetable productions mentionhas already been made; and they are nearly the same in all the districtsthrough which I passed.  It is observable, however, that although manyspecies of the edible roots which grow in the West India Islands arefound in Africa, yet I never saw, in any part of my journey, either thesugar-cane, the coffee, or the cocoa-tree, nor could I learn, on inquiry,that they were known to the natives.  The pine-apple and the thousandother delicious fruits which the industry of civilised man (improving thebounties of nature) has brought to so great perfection in the tropicalclimates of America, are here equally unknown.  I observed, indeed, a feworange and banana trees near the month of the Gambia, but whether theywere indigenous, or were formerly planted there by some of the whitetraders, I could not positively learn.  I suspect that they wereoriginally introduced by the Portuguese.</p><p> </p><p> Concerning property in the soil, it appeared to me that the lands innative woods were considered as belonging to the king, or (where thegovernment was not monarchical) to the state.  When any individual offree condition had the means of cultivating more land than he actuallypossessed, he applied to the chief man of the district, who allowed himan extension of territory, on condition of forfeiture if the lands werenot brought into cultivation by a given period.  The condition beingfulfilled, the soil became vested in the possessor, and, for ought thatappeared to me, descended his heirs.</p><p> </p><p> The population, however, considering the extent and fertility of thesoil, and the ease with which lands are obtained, is not very great inthe countries which I visited.  I found many extensive and beautifuldistricts entirely destitute of inhabitants, and, in general, the bordersof the different kingdoms were either very thinly peopled or entirelydeserted.  Many places are likewise unfavourable to population from beingunhealthful.  The swampy banks of the Gambia, the Senegal, and otherrivers towards the coast, are of this description.  Perhaps it is on thisaccount chiefly that the interior countries abound more with inhabitantsthan the maritime districts; for all the negro nations that fell under myobservation, though divided into a number of petty independent states,subsist chiefly by the same means, live nearly in the same temperature,and possess a wonderful similarity of disposition.  The Mandingoes, inparticular, are a very gentle race, cheerful in their dispositions,inquisitive, credulous, simple, and fond of flattery.  Perhaps the mostprominent defect in their character was that insurmountable propensity,which the reader must have observed to prevail in all classes of them, tosteal from me the few effects I was possessed of.  For this part of theirconduct no complete justification can be offered, because theft is acrime in their own estimation; and it must be observed that they are nothabitually and generally guilty of it towards each other.</p><p> </p><p> On the other hand, as some counterbalance to this depravity in theirnature, allowing it to be such, it is impossible for me to forget thedisinterested charity and tender solicitude with which many of these poorheathens (from the sovereign of Sego to the poor women who received me atdifferent times into their cottages when I was perishing of hunger)sympathised with me in my sufferings, relieved my distresses, andcontributed to my safety.  This acknowledgment, however, is perhaps moreparticularly due to the female part of the nation.  Among the men, as thereader must have seen, my reception, though generally kind, was sometimesotherwise.  It varied according to the various tempers of those to whom Imade application.  The hardness of avarice in some, and the blindness ofbigotry in others, had closed up the avenues to compassion; but I do notrecollect a single instance of hard-heartedness towards me in the women.In all my wanderings and wretchedness I found them uniformly kind andcompassionate; and I can truly say, as my predecessor Mr. Ledyard haseloquently said before me, “To a woman I never addressed myself in thelanguage of decency and friendship without receiving a decent andfriendly answer.  If I was hungry or thirsty, wet or sick, they did nothesitate, like the men, to perform a generous action.  In so free and sokind a manner did they contribute to my relief, that if I was dry, Idrank the sweetest draught, and if hungry, I ate the coarsest morsel witha double relish.”</p><p> </p><p> It is surely reasonable to suppose that the soft and amiable sympathy ofnature, which was thus spontaneously manifested towards me in mydistress, is displayed by these poor people, as occasion requires, muchmore strongly towards persons of their own nation and neighbourhood, andespecially when the objects of their compassion are endeared to them bythe ties of consanguinity.  Accordingly the maternal affection (neithersuppressed by the restraints nor diverted by the solicitudes of civilisedlife) is everywhere conspicuous among them, and creates a correspondentreturn of tenderness in the child.  An illustration of this has beenalready given.  “Strike me,” said my attendant, “but do not curse mymother.”  The same sentiment I found universally to prevail, and observedin all parts of Africa that the greatest affront which could be offeredto a negro was to reflect on her who gave him birth.</p><p> </p><p> It is not strange that this sense of filial duty and affection among thenegroes should be less ardent towards the father than the mother.  Thesystem of polygamy, while it weakens the father’s attachment by dividingit among the children of different wives, concentrates all the mother’sjealous tenderness to one point—the protection of her own offspring.  Iperceived with great satisfaction, too, that the maternal solicitudeextended, not only to the growth and security of the person, but also, ina certain degree, to the improvement of the mind of the infant; for oneof the first lessons in which the Mandingo women instruct their childrenis _the practice of truth_.  The reader will probably recollect the caseof the unhappy mother whose son was murdered by the Moorish banditti atFuningkedy.  Her only consolation in her uttermost distress was thereflection that the poor boy, in the course of his blameless life, _hadnever told a lie_.  Such testimony from a fond mother on such an occasionmust have operated powerfully on the youthful part of the surroundingspectators.  It was at once a tribute of praise to the deceased and alesson to the living.</p><p> </p><p> The negro women suckle their children until they are able to walk ofthemselves.  Three years’ nursing is not uncommon, and during this periodthe husband devotes his whole attention to his other wives.  To thispractice it is owing, I presume, that the family of each wife is seldomvery numerous.  Few women have more than five or six children.  As soonas an infant is able to walk it is permitted to run about with greatfreedom.  The mother is not over solicitous to preserve it from slightfalls and other trifling accidents.  A little practice soon enables achild to take care of itself, and experience acts the part of a nurse.As they advance in life the girls are taught to spin cotton and to beatcorn, and are instructed in other domestic duties; and the boys areemployed in the labours of the field.  Both sexes, whether bushreens orkafirs, on attaining the age of puberty, are circumcised.  This painfuloperation is not considered by the kafirs so much in the light of areligious ceremony as a matter of convenience and utility.  They have,indeed, a superstitious notion that it contributes to render the marriagestate prolific.  The operation is performed upon several young people atthe same time, all of whom are exempted from every sort of labour for twomonths afterwards.  During this period they form a society called_solimana_.  They visit the towns and villages in the neighbourhood,where they dance and sing, and are well treated by the inhabitants.  Ihad frequently, in the course of my journey, observed parties of thisdescription, but they were all males.  I had, however, an opportunity ofseeing a female _solimana_ at Kamalia.</p><p> </p><p> In the course of this celebration it frequently happens that some of theyoung women get married.  If a man takes a fancy to any one of them, itis not considered as absolutely necessary that he should make an overtureto the girl herself.  The first object is to agree with the parentsconcerning the recompense to be given them for the loss of the companyand services of their daughter.  The value of two slaves is a commonprice, unless the girl is thought very handsome, in which case theparents will raise their demand very considerably.  If the lover is richenough, and willing to give the sum demanded, he then communicates hiswishes to the damsel; but her consent is by no means necessary to thematch, for if the parents agree to it and eat a few _kolla_-nuts, whichare represented by the suitor as an earnest of the bargain, the younglady must either have the man of their choice or continue unmarried, forshe cannot afterwards be given to another.  If the parents should attemptit, the lover is then authorised by the laws of the country to seize uponthe girl as his slave.  When the day for celebrating the nuptials isfixed on, a select number of people are invited to be present at thewedding—a bullock or goat is killed, and great plenty of victuals isdressed for the occasion.  As soon as it is dark the bride is conductedinto a hut, where a company of matrons assist in arranging thewedding-dress, which is always white cotton, and is put on in such amanner as to conceal the bride from head to foot.  Thus arrayed, she isseated upon a mat in the middle of the floor, and the old women placethemselves in a circle round her.  They then give her a series ofinstructions, and point out, with great propriety, what ought to be herfuture conduct in life.  This scene of instruction, however, isfrequently interrupted by girls, who amuse the company with songs anddances, which are rather more remarkable for their gaiety than delicacy.While the bride remains within the hut with the women the bridegroomdevotes his attention to the guests of both sexes, who assemble withoutdoors, and by distributing among them small presents of kolla-nuts, andseeing that every one partakes of the good cheer which is provided, hecontributes much to the general hilarity of the evening.  When supper isended, the company spend the remainder of the night in singing anddancing, and seldom separate until daybreak.  About midnight the bride isprivately conducted by the women into the hut which is to be her futureresidence, and the bridegroom, upon a signal given, retires from hiscompany.</p><p> </p><p> The negroes, as hath been frequently observed, whether Mohammedan orpagan, allow a plurality of wives.  The Mohammedans alone are by theirreligion confined to four, and as the husband commonly pays a great pricefor each, he requires from all of them the utmost deference andsubmission, and treats them more like hired servants than companions.They have, however, the management of domestic affairs, and each inrotation is mistress of the household, and has the care of dressing thevictuals, overlooking the female slaves, etc.  But though the Africanhusbands are possessed of great authority over their wives I did notobserve that in general they treat them with cruelty, neither did Iperceive that mean jealousy in their dispositions which is so prevalentamong the Moors.  They permit their wives to partake of all publicdiversions, and this indulgence is seldom abused, for though the negrowomen are very cheerful and frank in their behaviour, they are by nomeans given to intrigue—I believe that instances of conjugal infidelityare not common.  When the wives quarrel among themselves—a circumstancewhich, from the nature of their situation, must frequently happen—thehusband decides between them, and sometimes finds it necessary toadminister a little corporal chastisement before tranquillity can berestored.  But if any one of the ladies complains to the chief of thetown that her husband has unjustly punished her, and shown an unduepartiality to some other of his wives, the affair is brought to a publictrial.  In these palavers, however, which are conducted chiefly bymarried men, I was informed that the complaint of the wife is not alwaysconsidered in a very serious light, and the complainant herself issometimes convicted of strife and contention and left without remedy.  Ifshe murmurs at the decision of the court the magic rod of Mumbo Jumbosoon puts an end to the business.</p><p> </p><p> The children of the Mandingoes are not always named after theirrelations, but frequently in consequence of some remarkable occurrence.Thus my landlord at Kamalia was called _Karfa_, a word signifying _toreplace_, because he was born shortly after the death of one of hisbrothers.  Other names are descriptive of good or bad qualities—as_Modi_, a good man; _Fadibba_, father of the town, etc.  Indeed, the verynames of their towns have something descriptive in them, as _Sibidooloo_,the town of ciboa-trees; _Kenneyeto_, victuals here; _Dosita_, lift yourspoon.  Others appear to be given by way of reproach—as _Bammakoo_, washa crocodile; _Karrankalla_, no cup to drink from, etc.  A child is namedwhen it is seven or eight days old.  The ceremony commences by shavingthe infant’s head; and a dish culled _dega_, made of pounded corn andsour milk, is prepared for the guests.  If the parents are rich, a sheepor goat is commonly added.  The feast is called _ding koon lee_ (thechild’s head-shaving).  During my stay at Kamalia I was present at fourdifferent feasts of this kind, and the ceremony was the same in each,whether the child belonged to a bushreen or a kafir.  The schoolmaster,who officiated as priest on those occasions, and who is necessarily abushreen, first said a long prayer over the dega, during which everyperson present took hold of the brim of the calabash with his right hand.After this the schoolmaster took the child in his arms and said a secondprayer, in which he repeatedly solicited the blessing of God upon thechild and upon all the company.  When this prayer was ended he whispereda few sentences in the child’s ear and spat three times in its face,after which he pronounced its name aloud, and returned the infant to themother. {80}  This part of the ceremony being ended, the father of thechild divided the dega into a number of balls, one of which hedistributed to every person present; and inquiry was then made if anyperson in the town was dangerously sick, it being usual in such cases tosend the party a large portion of the dega, which is thought to possessgreat medical virtues.</p><p> </p><p> Among the negroes every individual, besides his own proper name, haslikewise a _kontong_, or surname, to denote the family or clan to whichhe belongs.  Some of these families are very numerous and powerful.  Itis impossible to enumerate the various _kontongs_ which are found indifferent parts of the country, though the knowledge of many of them isof great service to the traveller; for as every negro plumes himself uponthe importance or the antiquity of his clan, he is much flattered when heis addressed by his kontong.</p><p> </p><p> Salutations among the negroes to each other when they meet are alwaysobserved, but those in most general use among the kafirs are, “_Abbehaeretto_,” “’_E ning seni_,” “_Anawari_,” etc., all of which have nearlythe same meaning, and signify “Are you well?” or to that effect.  Thereare likewise salutations which are used at different times of the day, as“_E ning somo_” (“Good morning”), etc.  The general answer to allsalutations is to repeat the kontong of the person who salutes, or elseto repeat the salutation itself, first pronouncing the word _marhaba_(“My friend”).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XXI.RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND INDUSTRIES OF THE MANDINGOES.</p><p> </p><p> THE Mandingoes and, I believe, the negroes in general, have no artificialmethod of dividing time.  They calculate the years by the number of_rainy seasons_.  They portion the year into _moons_, and reckon the daysby so many suns.  The day they divide into morning, midday, and evening;and farther subdivide it, when necessary, by pointing to the sun’s placein the heavens.  I frequently inquired of some of them what became of thesun during the night, and whether we should see the same sun, or adifferent one, in the morning; but I found that they considered thequestion as very childish.  The subject appeared to them as placed beyondthe reach of human investigation—they had never indulged a conjecture,nor formed any hypothesis, about the matter.  The moon, by varying herform, has more attracted their attention.  On the first appearance of thenew moon, which they look upon to be newly created, the pagan natives, aswell as Mohammedans, say a short prayer; and this seems to be the onlyvisible adoration which the kafirs offer up to the Supreme Being.  Thisprayer is pronounced in a whisper, the party holding up his hands beforehis face: its purport (as I have been assured by many different people)is to return thanks to God for His kindness through the existence of thepast moon, and to solicit a continuation of His favour during that of thenew one.  At the conclusion they spit upon their hands and rub them overtheir faces.  This seems to be nearly the same ceremony which prevailedamong the heathens in the days of Job. {82}</p><p> </p><p> Great attention, however, is paid to the changes of this luminary in itsmonthly course, and it is thought very unlucky to begin a journey, or anyother work of consequence, in the last quarter.  An eclipse, whether ofthe sun or moon, is supposed to be effected by witchcraft.  The stars arevery little regarded; and the whole study of astronomy appears to them asa useless pursuit, and attended to by such persons only as deal in magic.</p><p> </p><p> Their notions of geography are equally puerile.  They imagine that theworld is an extended plain, the termination of which no eye hasdiscovered—it being, they say, overhung with clouds and darkness.  Theydescribe the sea as a large river of salt water, on the farther shore ofwhich is situated a country called _Tobaubo doo_ (the land of the whitepeople).  At a distance from Tobaubo doo they describe another country,which they allege as inhabited by cannibals of gigantic size, called_komi_.  This country they call _Jong sang doo_ (the land where theslaves are sold).  But of all countries in the world their own appears tothem as the best, and their own people as the happiest, and they pity thefate of other nations, who have been placed by Providence in less fertileand less fortunate districts.</p><p> </p><p> Some of the religious opinions of the negroes, though blended with theweakest credulity and superstition, are not unworthy attention.  I haveconversed with all ranks and conditions upon the subject of their faith,and can pronounce, without the smallest shadow of doubt, that the beliefof one God and of a future state of reward and punishment is entire anduniversal among them.  It is remarkable, however, that except on theappearance of a new moon, as before related, the pagan natives do notthink it necessary to offer up prayers and supplications to the Almighty.They represent the Deity, indeed, as the creator and preserver of allthings, but in general they consider Him as a being so remote and of soexalted a nature that it is idle to imagine the feeble supplications ofwretched mortals can reverse the decrees and change the purposes ofunerring wisdom.  If they are asked for what reason then do they offer upa prayer on the appearance of the new moon, the answer is, that customhas made it necessary, they do it because their fathers did it beforethem.  Such is the blindness of unassisted nature!  The concerns of thisworld, they believe, are committed by the Almighty to the superintendenceand direction of subordinate spirits, over whom they suppose that certainmagical ceremonies have great influence.  A white fowl suspended to thebranch of a particular tree, a snake’s head or a few handfuls of fruitare offerings which ignorance and superstition frequently present, todeprecate the wrath, or to conciliate the favour, of these tutelaryagents.  But it is not often that the negroes make their religiousopinions the subject of conversation; when interrogated in particularconcerning their ideas of a future state, they express themselves withgreat reverence, but endeavour to shorten the discussion by observing,“_Mo o mo inta allo_” (“No man knows anything about it”).  They arecontent, they say, to follow the precepts and examples of theirforefathers through the various vicissitudes of life, and when this worldpresents no objects of enjoyment or of comfort they seem to look withanxiety towards another, which they believe will be better suited totheir natures, but concerning which they are far from indulging vain anddelusive conjectures.</p><p> </p><p> The Mandingoes seldom attain extreme old age.  At forty most of thembecome grey-haired and covered with wrinkles, and but few of them survivethe age of fifty-five or sixty.  They calculate the years of their lives,as I have already observed, by the number of rainy seasons (there beingbut one such in the year), and distinguish each year by a particularname, founded on some remarkable occurrence which happened in that year.Thus they say the year of the _Farbanna_ war—the year of the _Kaartawar_—the year on which _Gadou was plundered_, etc., etc.; and I have nodoubt that the year 1796 will in many places be distinguished by the nameof _tobaubo tambi sang_ (the year the white man passed), as such anoccurrence would naturally form an epoch in their traditional history.</p><p> </p><p> But notwithstanding that longevity is uncommon among them, it appeared tome that their diseases are but few in number.  Their simple diet andactive way of life preserve them from many of those disorders whichembitter the days of luxury and idleness.  Fevers and fluxes are the mostcommon and the most fatal.  For these they generally apply saphies todifferent parts of the body, and perform a great many other superstitiousceremonies—some of which are indeed well calculated to inspire thepatient with the hope of recovery, and divert his mind from brooding overhis own danger—but I have sometimes observed among them a more systematicmode of treatment.  On the first attack of a fever, when the patientcomplains of cold, he is frequently placed in a sort of vapour-bath.This is done by spreading branches of the _nauclea orientalis_ upon hotwood embers, and laying the patient upon them, wrapped up in a largecotton cloth.  Water is then sprinkled upon the branches, which,descending to the hot embers, soon covers the patient with a cloud ofvapour, in which he is allowed to remain until the embers are almostextinguished.  This practice commonly produces a profuse perspiration,and wonderfully relieves the sufferer.</p><p> </p><p> For the dysentery they use the bark of different trees reduced to powderand mixed with the patient’s food; but this practice is in general veryunsuccessful.</p><p> </p><p> The other diseases which prevail among the negroes are the _yaws_, the_elephantiasis_, and a _leprosy_ of the very worst kind.  Thislast-mentioned complaint appears at the beginning in scurfy spots upondifferent parts of the body, which finally settle upon the hands or feet,where the skin becomes withered, and, cracks in many places.  At lengththe ends of the fingers swell and ulcerate, the discharge is acrid andfetid, the nails drop off, and the bones of the fingers become carious,and separate at the joints.  In this manner the disease continues tospread, frequently until the patient loses all his fingers and toes.Even the hands and feet are sometimes destroyed by this inveteratemalady, to which the negroes give the name of _balla ou_ (incurable).</p><p> </p><p> The _guinea worm_ is likewise very common in certain places, especiallyat the commencement of the rainy season.  The negroes attribute thisdisease, which has been described by many writers, to bad water, andallege that the people who drink from wells are more subject to it thanthose who drink from streams.  To the same cause they attribute theswelling of the glands of the neck (_goitres_), which are very common insome parts of Bambarra.  I observed also, in the interior countries, afew instances of simple _gonorrhœa_, but never the confirmed _lues_.  Onthe whole, it appeared to me that the negroes are better surgeons thanphysicians.  I found them very successful in their management offractures and dislocations, and their splints and bandages are simple andeasily removed.  The patient is laid upon a soft mat, and the fracturedlimb is frequently bathed with cold water.  All abscesses they open withthe actual cautery, and the dressings are composed of either soft leaves,shea butter, or cow’s dung, as the case seems in their judgment torequire.  Towards the coast, where a supply of European lancets can beprocured, they sometimes perform phlebotomy, and in cases of localinflammation a curious sort of cupping is practised.  This operation isperformed by making incisions in the part, and applying to it a bullock’shorn with a small hole in the end.  The operator then takes a piece ofbee’s wax in his mouth, and, putting his lips to the hole, extracts theair from the horn, and by a dexterous use of his tongue stops up the holewith the wax.  This method is found to answer the purpose, and in generalproduces a plentiful discharge.</p><p> </p><p> When a person of consequence dies, the relations and neighbours meettogether and manifest their sorrow by loud and dismal howlings.  Abullock or goat is killed for such persons as come to assist at thefuneral, which generally takes place in the evening of the same day onwhich the party died.  The negroes have no appropriate burial-places, andfrequently dig the grave in the floor of the deceased’s hut, or in theshade of a favourite tree.  The body is dressed in white cotton, andwrapped up in a mat.  It is carried to the grave in the dusk of theevening by the relations.  If the grave is without the walls of the towna number of prickly bushes are laid upon it to prevent the wolves fromdigging up the body; but I never observed that any stone was placed overthe grave as a monument or memorial.</p><p> </p><p> Of their music and dances some account has incidentally been given indifferent parts of my journal.  On the first of these heads I have now toadd a list of their musical instruments, the principal of which are—the_koonting_, a sort of guitar with three strings; the _korro_, a largeharp with eighteen strings; the _simbing_, a small harp with sevenstrings; the _balafou_, an instrument composed of twenty pieces of hardwood of different lengths, with the shells of gourds hung underneath toincrease the sound; the _tangtang_, a drum open at the lower end; and,lastly, the _tabala_, a large drum, commonly used to spread an alarmthrough the country.  Besides these, they make use of small flutes,bow-strings, elephants’ teeth and bells; and at all their dances andconcerts _clapping of hands_ appears to constitute a necessary part ofthe chorus.</p><p> </p><p> With the love of music is naturally connected a taste for poetry; andfortunately for the poets of Africa they are in a great measure exemptedfrom that neglect and indigence which in more polished countries commonlyattend the votaries of the Muses.  They consist of two classes; the mostnumerous are the _singing men_, called _jilli kea_, mentioned in a formerpart of my narrative.  One or more of these may be found in every town.They sing extempore songs in honour of their chief men, or any otherpersons who are willing to give “solid pudding for empty praise.”  But anobler part of their office is to recite the historical events of theircountry; hence in war they accompany the soldiers to the field, in order,by reciting the great actions of their ancestors, to awaken in them aspirit of glorious emulation.  The other class are devotees of theMohammedan faith, who travel about the country singing devout hymns andperforming religious ceremonies, to conciliate the favour of theAlmighty, either in averting calamity or insuring success to anyenterprise.  Both descriptions of these itinerant bards are much employedand respected by the people, and very liberal contributions are made forthem.</p><p> </p><p> The usual diet of the negroes is somewhat different in differentdistricts; in general the people of free condition breakfast aboutdaybreak upon gruel made of meal and water, with a little of the fruit ofthe tamarind to give it an acid taste.  About two o’clock in theafternoon a sort of hasty pudding, with a little shea butter, is thecommon meal; but the supper constitutes the principal repast, and isseldom ready before midnight.  This consists almost universally ofkouskous, with a small portion of animal food or shea butter mixed withit.  In eating, the kafirs, as well as Mohammedans, use the right handonly.</p><p> </p><p> The beverages of the pagan negroes are beer and mead, of each of whichthey frequently drink to excess.  The Mohammedan convert drinks nothingbut water.  The natives of all descriptions take snuff and smoke tobacco;their pipes are made of wood, with an earthen bowl of curiousworkmanship.  But in the interior countries the greatest of all luxuriesis salt.  It would appear strange to a European to see a child suck apiece of rock salt as if it were sugar.  This, however, I have frequentlyseen, although, in the inland parts, the poorer class of inhabitants areso very rarely indulged with this precious article that to say _a man atesalt with his victuals_ is the same as saying _he is a very rich man_.  Ihave myself suffered great inconvenience from the scarcity of thisarticle.  The long use of vegetable food creates so painful a longing forsalt that no words can sufficiently describe it.</p><p> </p><p> The negroes in general, and the Mandingoes in particular, are consideredby the whites on the coast as an indolent and inactive people—I thinkwithout reason.  The nature of the climate is, indeed, unfavourable togreat exertion; but surely a people cannot justly be denominatedhabitually indolent whose wants are supplied, not by the spontaneousproductions of nature, but by their own exertions.  Few people workharder, when occasion requires, than the Mandingoes; but not having manyopportunities of turning to advantage the superfluous produce of theirlabour, they are content with cultivating as much ground only as isnecessary for their own support.  The labours of the field give thempretty full employment during the rains; and in the dry season the peoplewho live in the vicinity of large rivers employ themselves in fishing.The fish are taken in wicker baskets or with small cotton nets, and arepreserved by being first dried in the sun and afterwards rubbed with sheabutter, to prevent them from contracting fresh moisture.  Others of thenatives employ themselves in hunting.  Their weapons are bows and arrows;but the arrows in common use are not poisoned. {92}  They are verydexterous marksmen, and will hit a lizard on a tree, or any other smallobject, at an amazing distance.  They likewise kill guinea-fowls,partridges, and pigeons, but never on the wing.  While the men areoccupied in these pursuits the women are very diligent in manufacturingcotton cloth.  They prepare the cotton for spinning by laying it in smallquantities at a time upon a smooth stone or piece of wood, and rollingthe seeds out with a thick iron spindle; and they spin it with thedistaff.  The thread is not fine, but well twisted, and makes a verydurable cloth.  A woman with common diligence will spin from six to ninegarments of this cloth in one year, which, according to its fineness,will sell for a minkalli and a half or two minkallies each. {93}  Theweaving is performed by the men.  The loom is made exactly upon the sameprinciple as that of Europe, but so small and narrow that the web isseldom more than four inches broad.  The shuttle is of the commonconstruction, but as the thread is coarse the chamber is somewhat largerthan the European.</p><p> </p><p> The women dye this cloth of a rich and lasting blue colour by thefollowing simple process:—The leaves of the indigo, when fresh gathered,are pounded in a wooden mortar, and mixed in a large earthen jar with astrong ley of wood-ashes; chamber-ley is sometimes added.  The cloth issteeped in this mixture, and allowed to remain until it has acquired theproper shade.  In Kaarta and Ludamar, where the indigo is not plentiful,they collect the leaves and dry them in the sun; and when they wish touse them they reduce a sufficient quantity to powder and mix it with theley, as before mentioned.  Either way the colour is very beautiful, witha fine purple gloss, and equal in my opinion to the best Indian orEuropean blue.  This cloth is cut into various pieces and sewed intogarments with needles of the natives’ own making.</p><p> </p><p> As the arts of weaving, dyeing, sewing, etc., may easily be acquired,those who exercise them are not considered in Africa as following anyparticular profession, for almost every slave can weave, and every boycan sew.  The only artists who are distinctly acknowledged as such by thenegroes, and who value themselves on exercising appropriate and peculiartrades, are the manufacturers of _leather_ and of _iron_.  The first ofthese are called _karrankea_ (or, as the word is sometimes pronounced,_gaungay_).  They are to be found in almost every town, and theyfrequently travel through the country in the exercise of their calling.They tan and dress leather with very great expedition, by steeping thehide first in a mixture of wood-ashes and water until it parts with thehair, and afterwards by using the pounded leaves of a tree called _goo_as an astringent.  They are at great pains to render the hide as soft andpliant as possible, by rubbing it frequently between their hands andbeating it upon a stone.  The hides of bullocks are converted chieflyinto sandals, and therefore require less care in dressing than the skinsof sheep and goats, which are used for covering quivers and saphies, andin making sheaths for swords and knives, belts, pockets, and a variety ofornaments.  These skins commonly are dyed of a red or yellow colour—thered by means of millet stalks reduced to powder; and the yellow by theroot of a plant the name of which I have forgotten.</p><p> </p><p> The manufacturers in iron are not so numerous as the _karrankeas_, butthey appear to have studied their business with equal diligence.  Thenegroes on the coast being cheaply supplied with iron from the Europeantraders, never attempt the manufacturing of this article themselves; butin the inland parts the natives smelt this useful metal in suchquantities not only to supply themselves from it with all necessaryweapons and instruments, but even to make it a article of commerce withsome of the neighbouring states.  During my stay at Kamalia there was asmelting furnace at a short distance from the hut where I lodged, and theowner and his workmen made no secret about the manner of conducting theoperation, and readily allowed me to examine the furnace, and assist themin breaking the ironstone.  The furnace was a circular tower of clay,about ten feet high and three feet in diameter, surrounded in two placeswith withes, to prevent the clay from cracking and falling to pieces bythe violence of the heat.  Round the lower part, on a level with theground—but not so low as the bottom of the furnace, which was somewhatconcave—were made seven openings, into every one of which were placedthree tubes of clay, and the openings again plastered up in such a mannerthat no air could enter the furnace but through the tubes, by the openingand shutting of which they regulated the fire.  These tubes were formedby plastering a mixture of clay and grass round a smooth roller of wood,which, as soon as the clay began to harden, was withdrawn, and the tubeleft to dry in the sun.  The ironstone which I saw was very heavy, of adull red colour with greyish specks; it was broken into pieces about thesize of a hen’s egg.  A bundle of dry wood was first put into thefurnace, and covered with a considerable quantity of charcoal, which wasbrought, ready burnt, from the woods.  Over this was laid a stratum ofironstone, and then another of charcoal, and so on, until the furnace wasquite full.  The fire was applied through one of the tubes, and blown forsome time with bellows made of goats’ skins.  The operation went on veryslowly at first, and it was some hours before the flame appeared abovethe furnace; but after this it burnt with great violence all the firstnight, and the people who attended put in at times more charcoal.  On theday following the fire was not so fierce, and on the second night some ofthe tubes were withdrawn and the air allowed to have freer access to thefurnace; but the heat was still very great, and a bluish flame rose somefeet above the top of the furnace.  On the third day from thecommencement of the operation, all the tubes were taken out, the ends ofmany of them being vitrified with the heat; but the metal was not removeduntil some days afterwards, when the whole was perfectly cool.  Part ofthe furnace was then taken down, and the iron appeared in the form of alarge irregular mass, with pieces of charcoal adhering to it.  It wassonorous; and when any portion was broken off, the fracture exhibited agranulated appearance, like broken steel.  The owner informed me thatmany parts of this cake were useless, but still there was good ironenough to repay him for his trouble.  This iron, or rather steel, isformed into various instruments by being repeatedly heated in a forge,the heat of which is urged by a pair of double bellows of a very simpleconstruction, being made of two goats’ skins the tubes from which unitebefore they enter the forge, and supply a constant and very regularblast.  The hammer, forceps, and anvil are all very simple, and theworkmanship (particularly in the formation of knives and spears) is notdestitute of merit.  The iron, indeed, is hard and brittle, and requiresmuch labour before it can be made to answer the purpose.</p><p> </p><p> Such is the chief information I obtained concerning the present state ofarts and manufactures in those regions of Africa which I explored in myjourney.  I might add, though it is scarce worthy observation, that inBambarra and Kaarta the natives make very beautiful baskets, hats, andother articles, both for use and ornament, from rushes, which they stainof different colours; and they contrive also to cover their calabasheswith interwoven cane, dyed in the same manner.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XXII.WAR AND SLAVERY.</p><p> </p><p> A state of subordination and certain inequalities of rank and conditionare inevitable in every stage of civil society; but when thesubordination is carried to so great a length that the persons andservices of one part of the community are entirely at the disposal ofanother part, it may then be denominated a state of slavery, and in thiscondition of life a great body of the negro inhabitants of Africa havecontinued from the most early period of their history, with thisaggravation, that their children are born to no other inheritance.</p><p> </p><p> The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three toone to the freemen.  They claim no reward for their services except foodand clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to thegood or bad disposition of their masters.  Custom, however, hasestablished certain rules with regard to the treatment of slaves, whichit is thought dishonourable to violate.  Thus the domestic slaves, orsuch as are born in a man’s own house, are treated with more lenity thanthose which are purchased with money.  The authority of the master overthe domestic slave, as I have elsewhere observed, extends only toreasonable correction; for the master cannot sell his domestic, withouthaving first brought him to a public trial before the chief men of theplace.  But these restrictions on the power of the master extend not tothe care of prisoners taken in war, nor to that of slaves purchased withmoney.  All these unfortunate beings are considered as strangers andforeigners, who have no right to the protection of the law, and may betreated with severity, or sold to a stranger, according to the pleasureof their owners.  There are, indeed, regular markets, where slaves ofthis description are bought and sold, and the value of a slave, in theeye of an African purchaser, increases in proportion to his distance fromhis native kingdom: for when slaves are only a few days’ journey from theplace of their nativity they frequently effect their escape; but when oneor more kingdoms intervene, escape being more difficult, they are morereadily reconciled to their situation.  On this account the unhappy slaveis frequently transferred from one dealer to another, until he has lostall hopes of returning to his native kingdom.  The slaves which arepurchased by the Europeans on the coast are chiefly of this description.A few of them are collected in the petty wars, hereafter to be described,which take place near the coast, but by far the greater number arebrought down in large caravans from the inland countries, of which manyare unknown, even by name, to the Europeans.  The slaves which are thusbrought from the interior may be divided into two distinct classes—first,such as were slaves from their birth, having been born of enslavedmothers; secondly, such as were born free, but who afterwards, bywhatever means, became slaves.  Those of the first description are by farthe most numerous, for prisoners taken in war (at least such as are takenin open and declared war, when one kingdom avows hostilities againstanother) are generally of this description.  The comparatively smallproportion of free people to the enslaved throughout Africa has alreadybeen noticed: and it must be observed that men of free condition havemany advantages over the slaves, even in war time.  They are in generalbetter armed, and well mounted, and can either fight or escape with somehopes of success; but the slaves, who have only their spears and bows,and of whom great numbers are loaded with baggage, become an easy prey.Thus when Mansong, king of Bambarra, made war upon Kaarta (as I haverelated in a former chapter), he took in one day nine hundred prisoners,of which number not more than seventy were freemen.  This account Ireceived from Daman Jumma, who had thirty slaves at Kemmoo, all of whomwere made prisoners by Mansong.  Again, when a freeman is taken prisonerhis friends will sometimes ransom him by giving two slaves in exchange;but when a slave is taken, he has no hopes of such redemption.  To thesedisadvantages, it is to be added that the slatees, who purchase slaves inthe interior countries and carry them down to the coast for sale,constantly prefer such as have been in that condition of life from theirinfancy, well knowing that these have been accustomed to hunger andfatigue, and are better able to sustain the hardships of a long andpainful journey than freemen; and on their reaching the coast, if noopportunity offers of selling them to advantage, they can easily be madeto maintain themselves by their labour; neither are they so apt toattempt making their escape as those who have once tasted the blessingsof freedom.</p><p> </p><p> Slaves of the second description generally become such by one or other ofthe following causes:—1, captivity; 2, famine; 3, insolvency; 4, crimes.A freeman may, by the established customs of Africa, become a slave bybeing taken in war.  War is of all others the most productive source, andwas probably the origin, of slavery; for when one nation had taken fromanother a greater number of captives than could be exchanged on equalterms, it is natural to suppose that the conquerors, finding itinconvenient to maintain their prisoners, would compel them to labour—atfirst, perhaps, only for their own support, but afterwards to supporttheir masters.  Be this as it may, it is a known fact that prisoners ofwar in Africa are the slaves of the conquerors; and when the weak orunsuccessful warrior begs for mercy beneath the uplifted spear of hisopponent, he gives up at the same time his claim to liberty, andpurchases his life at the expense of his freedom.</p><p> </p><p> In a country divided into a thousand petty states, mostly independent andjealous of each other, where every freeman is accustomed to arms and fondof military achievements, where the youth, who has practised the bow andspear from his infancy, longs for nothing so much as an opportunity todisplay his valour, it is natural to imagine that wars frequentlyoriginate from very frivolous provocation.  When one nation is morepowerful than another, pretext is seldom wanting for commencinghostilities.  Thus the war between Kajaaga and Kasson was occasioned bythe detention of a fugitive slave; that between Bambarra and Kaarta bythe loss of a few cattle.  Other cases of the same nature perpetuallyoccur in which the folly or mad ambition of their princes and the zeal oftheir religious enthusiasts give full employment to the scythe ofdesolation.</p><p> </p><p> The wars of Africa are of two kinds, which are distinguished by differentappellations; that species which bears the greatest resemblance to ourEuropean contests is denominated _killi_, a word signifying “to callout,” because such wars are openly avowed and previously declared.  Warsof this description in Africa commonly terminate, however, in the courseof a single campaign.  A battle is fought—the vanquished seldom think ofrallying again—the whole inhabitants become panic-struck, and theconquerors have only to bind the slaves and carry off their plunder andtheir victims.  Such of the prisoners as, through age or infirmity, areunable to endure fatigue, or are found unfit for sale, are considered asuseless, and, I have no doubt, are frequently put to death.  The samefate commonly awaits a chief or any other person who has taken a verydistinguished part in the war.  And here it may be observed that,notwithstanding this exterminating system, it is surprising to behold howsoon an African town is rebuilt and repeopled.  The circumstance arisesprobably from this: that their pitched battles are few—the weakest knowtheir own situation, and seek safety in flight.  When their country hasbeen desolated, and their ruined towns and villages deserted by theenemy, such of the inhabitants as have escaped the _sword_ and the_chain_ generally return, though with cautious steps, to the place oftheir nativity—for it seems to be the universal wish of mankind to spendthe evening of their days where they passed their infancy.  The poornegro feels this desire in its full force.  To him no water is sweet butwhat is drawn from his own well, and no tree has so cool and pleasant ashade as the _tabba_ tree {104} of his native village.  When war compelshim to abandon the delightful spot in which he first drew his breath, andseek for safety in some other kingdom, his time is spent in talking aboutthe country of his ancestors; and no sooner is peace restored than heturns his back upon the land of strangers, rebuilds with haste his fallenwalls, and exults to see the smoke ascend from his native village.</p><p> </p><p> The other species of African warfare is distinguished by the appellationof _tegria_ (plundering, or stealing).  It arises from a sort ofhereditary feud which the inhabitants of one nation or district beartowards another.  No immediate cause of hostility is assigned, or noticeof attack given, but the inhabitants of each watch every opportunity toplunder and distress the objects of their animosity by predatoryexcursions.  These are very common, particularly about the beginning ofthe dry season, when the labour of the harvest is over and provisions areplentiful.  Schemes of vengeance are then meditated.  The chief mansurveys the number and activity of his vassals as they brandish theirspears at festivals, and, elated with his own importance, turns his wholethoughts towards revenging some depredation or insult which either he orhis ancestors may have received from a neighbouring state.</p><p> </p><p> Wars of this description are generally conducted with great secrecy.  Afew resolute individuals, headed by some person of enterprise andcourage, march quietly through the woods, surprise in the night someunprotected village, and carry off the inhabitants and their effectsbefore their neighbours can come to their assistance.  One morning duringmy stay at Kamalia we were all much alarmed by a party of this kind.  Theking of Fooladoo’s son, with five hundred horsemen, passed secretlythrough the woods a little to the southward of Kamalia, and on themorning following plundered three towns belonging to Madigai, a powerfulchief in Jallonkadoo.</p><p> </p><p> The success of this expedition encouraged the governor of Bangassi, atown in Fooladoo, to make a second inroad upon another part of the samecountry.  Having assembled about two hundred of his people, he passed theriver Kokoro in the night, and carried off a great number of prisoners.Several of the inhabitants who had escaped these attacks were afterwardsseized by the Mandingoes as they wandered about in the woods or concealedthemselves in the glens and strong places of the mountains.</p><p> </p><p> These plundering excursions always produced speedy retaliation: and whenlarge parties cannot be collected for this purpose, a few friends willcombine together and advance into the enemy’s country, with a view toplunder or carry off the inhabitants.  A single individual has been knownto take his bow and quiver and proceed in like manner.  Such an attemptis doubtless in him an act of rashness; but when it is considered that inone of these predatory wars he has probably been deprived of his child orhis nearest relation, his situation will rather call for pity thancensure.  The poor sufferer, urged on by the feelings of domestic orpaternal attachment and the ardour of revenge, conceals himself among thebushes until some young or unarmed person passes by.  He then,tiger-like, springs upon his prey, drags his victim into the thicket, andin the night carries him off as a slave.</p><p> </p><p> When a negro has, by means like these, once fallen into the hands of hisenemies, he is either retained as the slave of his conqueror, or barteredinto a distant kingdom; for an African, when he has once subdued hisenemy, will seldom give him an opportunity of lifting up his hand againsthim at a future period.  A conqueror commonly disposes of his captivesaccording to the rank which they held in their native kingdom.  Such ofthe domestic slaves as appear to be of a mild disposition, andparticularly the young women, are retained as his own slaves.  Othersthat display marks of discontent are disposed of in a distant country;and such of the freemen or slaves as have taken an active part in the warare either sold to the slatees or put to death.  War, therefore, iscertainly the most general and most productive source of slavery, and thedesolations of war often (but not always) produce the second cause ofslavery, _famine_; in which case a freeman becomes a slave to avoid agreater calamity.</p><p> </p><p> Perhaps, by a philosophic and reflecting mind, death itself wouldscarcely be considered as a greater calamity than slavery; but the poornegro, when fainting with hunger, thinks like Esau of old, “Behold, I amat the point to die, and what profit shall this birthright do to me?”There are many instances of freemen voluntarily surrendering up theirliberty to save their lives.  During a great scarcity, which lasted forthree years, in the countries of the Gambia, great numbers of peoplebecame slaves in this manner.  Dr. Laidley assured me that at that timemany freemen came and begged, with great earnestness, _to be put upon hisslave-chain_, to save them from perishing of hunger.  Large families arevery often exposed to absolute want; and as the parents have almostunlimited authority over their children, it frequently happens, in allparts of Africa, that some of the latter are sold to purchase provisionsfor the rest of the family.  When I was at Jarra, Daman Jumma pointed outto me three young slaves whom he had purchased in this manner.  I havealready related another instance which I saw at Wonda; and I was informedthat in Fooladoo, at that time, it was a very common practice.</p><p> </p><p> The third cause of slavery is _insolvency_.  Of all the offences (ifinsolvency may be so called) to which the laws of Africa have affixed thepunishment of slavery, this is the most common.  A negro trader commonlycontracts debts on some mercantile speculation, either from hisneighbours, to purchase such articles as will sell to advantage in adistant market, or from the European traders on the coast—payment to bemade in a given time.  In both cases the situation of the adventurer isexactly the same.  If he succeeds, he may secure an independency: if heis unsuccessful, his person and services are at the disposal of another;for in Africa, not only the effects of the insolvent, but even theinsolvent himself, is sold to satisfy the lawful demands of hiscreditors. {109}</p><p> </p><p> The fourth cause above enumerated is, _the commission of crimes on whichthe laws of the country affix slavery as a punishment_.  In Africa theonly offences of this class are murder, adultery, and witchcraft, and Iam happy to say that they did not appear to me to be common.  In cases ofmurder, I was informed that the nearest relation of the deceased had itin his power, after conviction, either to kill the offender with his ownhand or sell him into slavery.  When adultery occurs, it is generallyleft to the option of the person injured either to sell the culprit oraccept such a ransom for him as he may think equivalent to the injury hehas sustained.  By witchcraft is meant pretended magic, by which thelives or healths of persons are affected; in other words, it is theadministering of poison.  No trial for this offence, however, came undermy observation while I was in Africa, and I therefore suppose that thecrime and its punishment occur but very seldom.</p><p> </p><p> When a freeman has become a slave by any one of the causes beforementioned, he generally continues so for life, and his children (if theyare born of an enslaved mother) are brought up in the same state ofservitude.  There are, however, a few instances of slaves obtaining theirfreedom, and sometimes even with the consent of their masters, as byperforming some singular piece of service, or by going to battle andbringing home two slaves as a ransom; but the common way of regainingfreedom is by escape, and when slaves have once set their minds onrunning away they often succeed.  Some of them will wait for years beforean opportunity presents itself, and during that period show no signs ofdiscontent.  In general, it may be remarked that slaves who come from ahilly country and have been much accustomed to hunting and travel, aremore apt to attempt to make their escape than such as are born in a flatcountry and have been employed in cultivating the land.</p><p> </p><p> Such are the general outlines of that system of slavery which prevails inAfrica, and it is evident, from its nature and extent, that it is asystem of no modern date.  It probably had its origin in the remote agesof antiquity, before the Mohammedans explored a path across the desert.How far it is maintained and supported by the slave traffic which for twohundred years the nations of Europe have carried on with the natives ofthe coast, it is neither within my province nor in my power to explain.If my sentiments should be required concerning the effect which adiscontinuance of that commerce would produce on the manners of thenatives, I should have no hesitation in observing that, in the presentunenlightened state of their minds, my opinion is, the effect wouldneither be so extensive nor beneficial as many wise and worthy personsfondly expect.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XXIII.GOLD AND IVORY.</p><p> </p><p> THOSE valuable commodities, gold and ivory (the next objects of ourinquiry), have probably been found in Africa from the first ages of theworld.  They are reckoned among its most important productions in theearliest records of its history.</p><p> </p><p> It has been observed that gold is seldom or never discovered except in_mountainous_ and _barren_ countries—nature, it is said, thus makingamends in one way for her penuriousness in the other.  This, however, isnot wholly true.  Gold is found in considerable quantities throughoutevery part of Manding, a country which is indeed hilly, but cannotproperly be called _mountainous_, much less _barren_.  It is also foundin great plenty in Jallonkadoo (particularly about Boori), another hilly,but by no means an unfertile, country.  It is remarkable that in theplace last mentioned (Boori), which is situated about four days’ journeyto the south-west of Kamalia, the salt market is often supplied at thesame time with rock-salt from the Great Desert and sea-salt from the RioGrande; the price of each, at this distance from its source, being nearlythe same.  And the dealers in each, whether Moors from the north ornegroes from the west, are invited thither by the same motives—that ofbartering their salt for gold.</p><p> </p><p> The gold of Manding, so far as I could learn, is never found in anymatrix or vein, but always in small grains nearly in a pure state, fromthe size of a pin’s head to that of a pea, scattered through a large bodyof sand or clay, and in this state it is called by the Mandingoes _sanoomunko_ (gold powder).  It is, however, extremely probable, by what Icould learn of the situation of the ground, that most of it hasoriginally been washed down by repeated torrents from the neighbouringhills.  The manner in which it is collected is nearly as follows:—</p><p> </p><p> About the beginning of December, when the harvest is over and the streamsand torrents have greatly subsided, the mansa or chief of the townappoints a day to begin _sanoo koo_ (gold-washing), and the women aresure to have themselves in readiness by the time appointed.  A hoe orspade for digging up the sand, two or three calabashes for washing it in,and a few quills for containing the gold dust, are all the implementsnecessary for the purpose.  On the morning of their departure a bullockis killed for the first day’s entertainment, and a number of prayers andcharms are used to insure success, for a failure on that day is thought abad omen.</p><p> </p><p> The mansa of Kamalia, with fourteen of his people, were, I remember, somuch disappointed in their first day’s washing that very few of them hadresolution to persevere, and the few that did had but very indifferentsuccess: which indeed is not much to be wondered at, for instead ofopening some untried place they continued to dig and wash in the samespot where they had dug and washed for years, and where, of course, butfew large grains could be left.</p><p> </p><p> The washing of the sands of the streams is by far the easiest way ofobtaining the gold dust; but in most places the sands have been sonarrowly searched before, that unless the stream takes some new coursethe gold is found but in small quantities.  While some of the party arebusied in washing the sands, others employ themselves farther up thetorrent, where the rapidity of the stream has carried away all the clay,sand, etc., and left nothing but small pebbles.  The search among theseis a very troublesome task.  I have seen women who have had the skin wornoff the tops of their fingers in this employment.  Sometimes, however,they are rewarded by finding pieces of gold, which they call _sanoobirro_ (gold stones), that amply repay them for their trouble.  A womanand her daughter, inhabitants of Kamalia, found in one day two pieces ofthis kind; one of five drachms and the other of three drachms weight.But the most certain and profitable mode of washing is practised in theheight of the dry season, by digging a deep pit, like a draw-well, nearsome hill which has previously been discovered to contain gold.  The pitis dug with small spades or corn-hoes, and the earth is drawn up in largecalabashes.  As the negroes dig through the different strata of clay orsand, a calabash or two of each is washed by way of experiment; and inthis manner the labourers proceed, until they come to a stratumcontaining gold, or until they are obstructed by rocks, or inundated bywater.  In general, when they come to a stratum of fine reddish sand,with small black specks therein, they find gold in some proportion orother, and send up large calabashes full of the sand for the women towash; for though the pit is dug by the men, the gold is always washed bythe women, who are accustomed from their infancy to a similar operationin separating the husks of corn from the meal.</p><p> </p><p> As I never descended into any one of these pits, I cannot say in whatmanner they are worked underground.  Indeed, the situation in which I wasplaced made it necessary for me to be cautious not to incur the suspicionof the natives by examining too far into the riches of their country; butthe manner of separating the gold from the sand is very simple, and isfrequently performed by the women in the middle of the town; for when thesearchers return, from the valleys in the evening, they commonly bringwith them each a calabash or two of sand, to be washed by such of thefemales as remain at home.  The operation is simply as follows:—</p><p> </p><p> A portion of sand or clay (for the gold is sometimes found in abrown-coloured clay) is put into a large calabash and mixed with asufficient quantity of water.  The woman whose office it is, then shakesthe calabash in such a manner as to mix the sand and water together, andgive the whole a rotatory motion—at first gently, but afterwards morequickly, until a small portion of sand and water, at every revolution,flies over the brim of the calabash.  The sand thus separated is only thecoarsest particles mixed with a little muddy water.  After the operationhas been continued for some time, the sand is allowed to subside, and thewater poured off; a portion of coarse sand, which is now uppermost in thecalabash, is removed by the hand, and, fresh water being added, theoperation is repeated until the water comes off almost pure.  The womannow takes a second calabash, and shakes the sand and water gently fromthe one to the other, reserving that portion of sand which is next thebottom of the calabash, and which is most likely to contain the gold.This small quantity is mixed with some pure water, and, being moved aboutin the calabash, is carefully examined.  If a few particles of gold arepicked out, the contents of the other calabash are examined in the samemanner, but in general the party is well contented if she can obtainthree or four grains from the contents of both calabashes.  Some women,however, by long practice, become so well acquainted with the nature ofthe sand, and the mode of washing it, that they will collect gold whereothers cannot find a single particle.  The gold dust is kept in quillsstopped up with cotton; and the washers are fond of displaying a numberof these quills in their hair.  Generally speaking, if a person usescommon diligence in a proper soil, it is supposed that as much gold maybe collected by him in the course of the dry season as is equal to thevalue of two slaves.</p><p> </p><p> Thus simple is the process by which the negroes obtain gold in Manding;and it is evident from this account that the country contains aconsiderable portion of this precious metal, for many of the smallerparticles must necessarily escape the observation of the naked eye; andas the natives generally search the sands of streams at a considerabledistance from the hills, and consequently far removed from the mineswhere the gold was originally produced, the labourers are sometimes butill-paid for their trouble.  Minute particles only of this heavy metalcan be carried by the current to any considerable distance; the largermust remain deposited near the original source from whence they came.Were the gold-bearing streams to be traced to their fountains, and thehills from whence they spring properly examined, the sand in which thegold is there deposited would no doubt be found to contain particles of amuch larger size; and even the small grains might be collected toconsiderable advantage by the use of quicksilver and other improvements,with which the natives are at present unacquainted.</p><p> </p><p> Part of this gold is converted into ornaments for the women, but ingeneral these ornaments are more to be admired for their weight thantheir workmanship.  They are massy and inconvenient, particularly theearrings, which are commonly so heavy as to pull down and lacerate thelobe of the ear; to avoid which, they are supported by a thong of redleather, which passes over the crown of the head from one ear to theother.  The necklace displays greater fancy, and the proper arrangementof the different beads and plates of gold is the great criterion of tasteand elegance.  When a lady of consequence is in full dress, her goldornaments may be worth altogether from fifty to eighty pounds sterling.</p><p> </p><p> A small quantity of gold is likewise employed by the slatees in defrayingthe expenses of their journeys to and from the coast, but by far thegreater proportion is annually carried away by the Moors in exchange forsalt and other merchandise.  During my stay at Kamalia, the goldcollected by the different traders at that place for salt alone wasnearly equal to one hundred and ninety-eight pounds sterling; and asKamalia is but a small town, and not much resorted to by the tradingMoors, this quantity must have borne a very small proportion to the goldcollected at Kancaba, Kankaree, and some other large towns.  The value ofsalt in this part of Africa is very great.  One slab, about two feet anda half in length, fourteen inches in breadth, and two inches inthickness, will sometimes sell for about two pounds ten shillingssterling; and from one pound fifteen shillings to two pounds may beconsidered as the common price.  Four of these slabs are considered as aload for an ass, and six for a bullock.  The value of Europeanmerchandise in Manding varies very much according to the supply from thecoast, or the dread of war in the country; but the return for sucharticles is commonly made in slaves.  The price of a prime slave, when Iwas at Kamalia, was from twelve to nine minkallies, and Europeancommodities had then nearly the following value:—</p><p> </p><p> 18 gun-flints,                      one minkalli.</p><p> </p><p> 48 leaves of tobacco,</p><p> </p><p> 20 charges of gunpowder,</p><p> </p><p> A cutlass,A musket,                           from three to four minkallies.</p><p> </p><p> The produce of the country and the different necessaries of life, whenexchanged for gold, sold as follows:—</p><p> </p><p> Common provisions for one day, the weight of one _teeleekissi_ (a blackbean, six of which make the weight of one minkalli); a chicken, oneteeleekissi; a sheep, three teeleekissi; a bullock, one minkalli; ahorse, from ten to seventeen minkallies.</p><p> </p><p> The negroes weigh the gold in small balances, which they always carryabout them.  They make no difference, in point of value, between golddust and wrought gold.  In bartering one article for another, the personwho receives the gold always weighs it with his own teeleekissi.  Thesebeans are sometimes fraudulently soaked in shea-butter to make themheavy, and I once saw a pebble ground exactly into the form of one ofthem; but such practices are not very common.</p><p> </p><p> Having now related the substance of what occurs to my recollectionconcerning the African mode of obtaining gold from the earth, and itsvalue in barter, I proceed to the next article of which I proposed totreat—namely, ivory.</p><p> </p><p> Nothing creates a greater surprise among the negroes on the sea-coastthan the eagerness displayed by the European traders to procureelephants’ teeth, it being exceedingly difficult to make them comprehendto what use it is applied.  Although they are shown knives with ivoryhandles, combs and toys of the same material, and are convinced that theivory thus manufactured was originally parts of a tooth, they are notsatisfied.  They suspect that this commodity is more frequently convertedin Europe to purposes of far greater importance, the true nature of whichis studiously concealed from them, lest the price of ivory should beenhanced.  They cannot, they say, easily persuade themselves that shipswould be built and voyages undertaken to procure an article which had noother value than that of furnishing handles to knives, etc., when piecesof wood would answer the purpose equally well.</p><p> </p><p> Elephants are very numerous in the interior of Africa, but they appear tobe a distinct species from those found in Asia.  Blumenbach, in hisfigures of objects of natural history, has given good drawings of agrinder of each, and the variation is evident.  M. Cuvier also has givenin the _Magasin Encyclopédique_ a clear account of the difference betweenthem.  As I never examined the Asiatic elephant, I have chosen rather torefer to those writers than advance this as an opinion of my own.  It hasbeen said that the African elephant is of a less docile nature than theAsiatic, and incapable of being tamed.  The negroes certainly do not atpresent tame them; but when we consider that the Carthaginians had alwaystame elephants in their armies, and actually transported some of them toItaly in the course of the Punic wars, it seems more likely that theyshould have possessed the art of taming their own elephants than havesubmitted to the expense of bringing such vast animals from Asia.Perhaps the barbarous practice of hunting the African elephants for thesake of their teeth has rendered them more untractable and savage thanthey were found to be in former times.</p><p> </p><p> The greater part of the ivory which is sold on the Gambia and Senegalrivers is brought from the interior country.  The lands towards the coastare too swampy and too much intersected with creeks and rivers for sobulky an animal as the elephant to travel through without beingdiscovered; and when once the natives discern the marks of his feet inthe earth, the whole village is up in arms.  The thoughts of feasting onhis flesh, making sandals of his hide, and selling the teeth to theEuropeans, inspire every one with courage, and the animal seldom escapesfrom his pursuers; but in the plains of Bambarra and Kaarta, and theextensive wilds of Jallonkadoo, the elephants are very numerous, and,from the great scarcity of gunpowder in those districts, they are lessannoyed by the natives.</p><p> </p><p> Scattered teeth are frequently picked up in the woods, and travellers arevery diligent in looking for them.  It is a common practice with theelephant to thrust his teeth under the roots of such shrubs and bushes asgrow in the more dry and elevated parts of the country, where the soil isshallow.  These bushes he easily overturns, and feeds on the roots, whichare in general more tender and juicy than the hard, woody branches or thefoliage; but when the teeth are partly decayed by age, and the roots morefirmly fixed, the great exertions of the animal in this practicefrequently cause them to break short.  At Kamalia I saw two teeth, one avery large one, which were found in the woods, and which were evidentlybroken off in this manner.  Indeed, it is difficult otherwise to accountfor such a large proportion of broken ivory as is daily offered for saleat the different factories, for when the elephant is killed in hunting,unless he dashes himself over a precipice, the teeth are always extractedentire.</p><p> </p><p> There are certain seasons of the year when the elephants collect intolarge herds, and traverse the country in quest of food or water; and asall that part of the country to the north of the Niger is destitute ofrivers, whenever the pools in the woods are dried up the elephantsapproach towards the banks of that river.  Here they continue until thecommencement of the rainy season, in the months of June or July, andduring this time they are much hunted by such of the Bambarrans as havegunpowder to spare.  The elephant-hunters seldom go out singly—a party offour or five join together, and having each furnished himself with powderand ball, and a quantity of corn-meal in a leather bag sufficient forfive or six days’ provision, they enter the most unfrequented parts ofthe wood, and examine with great care everything that can lead to thediscovery of the elephants.  In this pursuit, notwithstanding the bulk ofthe animal, very great nicety of observation is required.  The brokenbranches, the scattered dung of the animal, and the marks of his feet arecarefully inspected; and many of the hunters have, by long experience andattentive observation, become so expert in their search that as soon asthey observe the foot-marks of an elephant they will tell almost to acertainty at what time it passed and at what distance it will be found.</p><p> </p><p> When they discover a herd of elephants, they follow them at a distance,until they perceive some one stray from the rest and come into such asituation as to be fired at with advantage.  The hunters then approachwith great caution, creeping amongst the long grass, until they have gotnear enough to be sure of their aim.  They then discharge all theirpieces at once, and throw themselves on their faces among the grass; thewounded elephant immediately applies his trunk to the different wounds,but being unable to extract the balls, and seeing nobody near him, hebecomes quite furious and runs about amongst the bushes until by fatigueand loss of blood he has exhausted himself, and affords the hunters anopportunity of firing a second time at him, by which he is generallybrought to the ground.</p><p> </p><p> The skin is now taken off, and extended on the ground with pegs to dry;and such parts of the flesh as are most esteemed are cut up into thinslices, and dried in the sun, to serve for provisions on some futureoccasion.  The teeth are struck out with a light hatchet which thehunters always carry along with them, not only for that purpose, but alsoto enable them to cut down such trees as contain honey; for though theycarry with them only five or six days’ provisions, they will remain inthe woods for months if they are successful, and support themselves uponthe flesh of such elephants as they kill and wild honey.</p><p> </p><p> The ivory thus collected is seldom brought down to the coast by thehunters themselves.  They dispose of it to the itinerant merchants whocome annually from the coast with arms and ammunition to purchase thisvaluable commodity.  Some of these merchants will collect ivory in thecourse of one season sufficient to load four or five asses.  A greatquantity of ivory is likewise brought from the interior by the slavecoffles; there are, however, some slatees of the Mohammedan persuasionwho, from motives of religion, will not deal in ivory, nor eat of theflesh of the elephant, unless it has been killed with a spear.</p><p> </p><p> The quantity of ivory collected in this part of Africa is not so great,nor are the teeth in general so large, as in the countries nearer theLine: few of them weigh more than eighty or one hundred pounds, and uponan average a bar of European merchandise may be reckoned as the price ofa pound of ivory.</p><p> </p><p> I have now, I trust, in this and the preceding chapters explained withsufficient minuteness the nature and extent of the commercial connectionwhich at present prevails, and has long subsisted, between the negronatives of those parts of Africa which I visited and the nations ofEurope; and it appears that slaves, gold, and ivory, together with thefew articles enumerated in the beginning of my work—viz., bees’ wax andhoney, hides, gums, and dye-woods—constitute the whole catalogue ofexportable commodities.  Other productions, however, have beenincidentally noticed as the growth of Africa, such as grain of differentkinds, tobacco, indigo, cotton-wool and perhaps a few others; but of allthese (which can only be obtained by cultivation and labour) the nativesraise sufficient only for their own immediate expenditure; nor, under thepresent system of their laws, manners, trade, and government, cananything further be expected from them.  It cannot, however, admit of adoubt that all the rich and valuable productions both of the East andWest Indies might easily be naturalised and brought to the utmostperfection in the tropical parts of this immense continent.  Nothing iswanting to this end but example to enlighten the minds of the natives,and instruction to enable them to direct their industry to properobjects.  It was not possible for me to behold the wonderful fertility ofthe soil, the vast herds of cattle, proper both for labour and food, anda variety of other circumstances favourable to colonisation andagriculture—and reflect, withal, on the means which presented themselvesof a vast inland navigation without—lamenting that a country soabundantly gifted and favoured by nature should remain in its presentsavage and neglected state.  Much more did I lament that a people ofmanners and disposition so gentle and benevolent should either be left asthey now are, immersed in the gross and uncomfortable blindness of pagansuperstition, or permitted to become converts to a system of bigotry andfanaticism which, without enlightening the mind, often debases the heart.On this subject many observations might be made, but the reader willprobably think that I have already digressed too largely; and I now,therefore, return to my situation at Kamalia.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XXIV.MOHAMMEDAN CUSTOMS; ARRIVAL AT KINYTAKOORO.</p><p> </p><p> THE schoolmaster to whose care I was entrusted during the absence ofKarfa was a man of a mild disposition and gentle manners; his name wasFankooma, and although he himself adhered strictly to the religion ofMohammed, he was by no means intolerant in his principles towards otherswho differed from him.  He spent much of his time in reading, andteaching appeared to be his pleasure as well as employment.  His schoolconsisted of seventeen boys, most of whom were sons of Kafirs, and twogirls, one of whom was Karfa’s own daughter.  The girls received theirinstruction in the daytime, but the boys always had their lessons, by thelight of a large fire, before day break and again late in the evening;for, being considered, during their scholarship, as the domestic slavesof the master, they were employed in planting corn, bringing firewood,and in other servile offices through the day.</p><p> </p><p> Exclusive of the Koran, and a book or two of commentaries thereon, theschoolmaster possessed a variety of manuscripts, which had partly beenpurchased from the trading Moors, and partly borrowed from bushreens inthe neighbourhood and copied with great care.  Other manuscripts had beenproduced to me at different places in the course of my journey; and onrecounting those I had before seen, and those which were now shown to me,and interrogating the schoolmaster on the subject, I discovered that thenegroes are in possession (among others) of an Arabic version of thePentateuch of Moses, which they call _Taureta la Moosa_.  This is sohighly esteemed that it is often sold for the value of one prime slave.They have likewise a version of the Psalms of David (_Zabora Dawidi_);and, lastly, the Book of Isaiah, which they call _Lingeeli la Isa_, andit is in very high esteem.  I suspect, indeed, that in all these copiesthere are interpolations of some of the peculiar tenets of Mohammed, forI could distinguish in many passages the name of the Prophet.  It ispossible, however, that this circumstance might otherwise have beenaccounted for if my knowledge of the Arabic had been more extensive.  Bymeans of those books many of the converted negroes have acquired anacquaintance with some of the remarkable events recorded in the OldTestament.  The account of our first parents, the death of Abel, theDeluge, the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the story of Joseph andhis brethren, the history of Moses, David, Solomon, etc.; all these havebeen related to me, in the Mandingo language, with tolerable exactness bydifferent people; and my surprise was not greater, on hearing theseaccounts from the lips of the negroes, than theirs on finding that I wasalready acquainted with them; for although the negroes in general have avery great idea of the wealth and power of the Europeans, I am afraidthat the Mohammedan converts among them think but very lightly of oursuperior attainments in religious knowledge.  The white traders in themaritime districts take no pains to counteract this unhappy prejudice,always performing their own devotions in secret, and seldom condescendingto converse with the negroes in a friendly and instructive manner.  Tome, therefore, it was not so much the subject of wonder as matter ofregret to observe that, while the superstition of Mohammed has in thismanner scattered a few faint beams of learning among these poor people,the precious light of Christianity is altogether excluded.  I could notbut lament that, although the coast of Africa has now been known andfrequented by the Europeans for more than two hundred years, yet thenegroes still remain entire strangers to the doctrines of our holyreligion.  We are anxious to draw from obscurity the opinions and recordsof antiquity, the beauties of Arabian and Asiatic literature, etc.; butwhile our libraries are thus stored with the learning of variouscountries, we distribute with a parsimonious hand the blessings ofreligious truth to the benighted nations of the earth.  The natives ofAsia derive but little advantage in this respect from an intercourse withus; and even the poor Africans, whom we affect to consider as barbarians,look upon us, I fear, as little better than a race of formidable butignorant heathens.  When I produced Richardson’s Arabic Grammar to someslatees on the Gambia, they were astonished to think that any Europeanshould understand and write the sacred language of their religion.  Atfirst they suspected that it might have been written by some of theslaves carried from the coast, but on a closer examination they weresatisfied that no bushreen could write such beautiful Arabic, and one ofthem offered to give me an ass and sixteen bars of goods if I would partwith the book.  Perhaps a short and easy introduction to Christianity,such as is found in some of the catechisms for children, elegantlyprinted in Arabic, and distributed on different parts of the coast, mighthave a wonderful effect.  The expense would be but trifling; curiositywould induce many to read it; and the evident superiority which it wouldpossess over their present manuscripts, both in point of elegance andcheapness, might at last obtain it a place among the school-books ofAfrica.</p><p> </p><p> The reflections which I have thus ventured to submit to my readers onthis important subject naturally suggested themselves to my mind onperceiving the encouragement which was thus given to learning (such as itis) in many parts of Africa.  I have observed that the pupils at Kamaliawere most of them the children of pagans; their parents, therefore, couldhave had no predilection for the doctrines of Mohammed.  Their aim wastheir children’s improvement; and if a more enlightened system hadpresented itself, it would probably have been preferred.  The children,too, wanted not a spirit of emulation, which it is the aim of the tutorto encourage.  When any one of them has read through the Koran, andperformed a certain number of public prayers, a feast is prepared by theschoolmaster, and the scholar undergoes an examination, or (in Europeanterms) _takes out his degree_.  I attended at three differentinaugurations of this sort, and heard with pleasure the distinct andintelligent answers which the scholars frequently gave to the bushreens,who assembled on those occasions and acted as examiners.  When thebushreens had satisfied themselves respecting the learning and abilitiesof the scholar, the last page of the Koran was put into his hand, and hewas desired to read it aloud.  After the boy had finished this lesson, hepressed the paper against his forehead and pronounced the word _Amen_,upon which all the bushreens rose, and, shaking him cordially by thehand, bestowed upon him the title of bushreen.</p><p> </p><p> When a scholar has undergone this examination, his parents are informedthat he has completed his education, and that it is incumbent on them toredeem their son by giving to the schoolmaster a slave or the price of aslave in exchange, which is always done if the parents can afford to doit; if not, the boy remains the domestic slave of the schoolmaster untilhe can, by his own industry, collect goods sufficient to ransom himself.</p><p> </p><p> About a week after the departure of Karfa three Moors arrived at Kamaliawith a considerable quantity of salt and other merchandise, which theyhad obtained on credit from a merchant of Fezzan, who had lately arrivedat Kancaba.  Their engagement was to pay him his price when the goodswere sold, which they expected would be in the course of a month.  Beingrigid bushreens, they were accommodated with two of Karfa’s huts, andsold their goods to very great advantage.</p><p> </p><p> On the 24th of January Karfa returned to Kamalia with a number of peopleand thirteen prime slaves whom he had purchased.  He likewise broughtwith him a young girl whom he had married at Kancaba, as his fourth wife,and had given her parents three prime slaves for her.  She was kindlyreceived at the door of the baloon by Karfa’s other wives, who conductedtheir new acquaintance and co-partner into one of the best huts, whichthey had caused to be swept and whitewashed on purpose to receive her.</p><p> </p><p> My clothes were by this time become so very ragged that I was almostashamed to appear out of doors, but Karfa, on the day after his arrival,generously presented me with such a garment and trousers as are commonlyworn in the country.</p><p> </p><p> The slaves which Karfa had brought with him were all of them prisoners ofwar; they had been taken by the Bambarra army in the kingdoms of Wasselaand Kaarta, and carried to Sego, where some of them had remained threeyears in irons.  From Sego they were sent, in company with a number ofother captives, up the Niger in two large canoes, and offered for sale atYamina, Bammakoo, and Kancaba; at which places the greater number of thecaptives were bartered for gold dust, and the remainder sent forward toKankaree.</p><p> </p><p> Eleven of them confessed to me that they had been slaves from theirinfancy, but the other two refused to give any account of their formercondition.  They were all very inquisitive, but they viewed me at firstwith looks of horror, and repeatedly asked if my countrymen werecannibals.  They were very desirous to know what became of the slavesafter they had crossed the salt water.  I told them that they wereemployed in cultivation the land; but they would not believe me, and oneof them, putting his hand upon the ground, said, with great simplicity,“Have you really got such ground as this to set your feet upon?”  Adeeply-rooted idea that the whites purchase negroes for the purpose ofdevouring them, or of selling them to others that they may be devouredhereafter, naturally makes the slaves contemplate a journey towards thecoast with great terror, insomuch that the slatees are forced to keepthem constantly in irons, and watch them very closely, to prevent theirescape.  They are commonly secured by putting the right leg of one andthe left of another into the same pair of fetters.  By supporting thefetters with a string, they can walk, though very slowly.  Every fourslaves are likewise fastened together by the necks with a strong rope oftwisted thongs, and in the night an additional pair of fetters is put ontheir hands, and sometimes a light iron chain passed round their necks.</p><p> </p><p> Such of them as evince marks of discontent are secured in a differentmanner.  A thick billet of wood is cut about three feet long, and, asmooth notch being made upon one side of it, the ankle of the slave isbolted to the smooth part by means of a strong iron staple, one prong ofwhich passes on each side of the ankle.  All these fetters and bolts aremade from native iron; in the present case they were put on by theblacksmith as soon as the slaves arrived from Kancaba, and were not takenoff until the morning on which the coffle departed for Gambia.</p><p> </p><p> In other respects the treatment of the slaves during their stay atKamalia was far from being harsh or cruel.  They were led out in theirfetters every morning to the shade of the tamarind-tree, where they wereencouraged to play at games of hazard, and sing diverting songs, to keepup their spirits; for, though some of them sustained the hardships oftheir situation with amazing fortitude, the greater part were very muchdejected, and would sit all day in a sort of sullen melancholy, withtheir eyes fixed upon the ground.  In the evening their irons wereexamined, and their hand-fetters put on, after which they were conductedinto two large huts, where they were guarded during the night by Karfa’sdomestic slaves.  But, notwithstanding all this, about a week after theirarrival, one of the slaves had the address to procure a small knife, withwhich he opened the rings of his fetters, cut the rope, and made hisescape; more of them would probably have got off had they assisted eachother, but the slave no sooner found himself at liberty than he refusedto stop and assist in breaking the chain which was fastened round thenecks of his companions.</p><p> </p><p> As all the slatees and slaves belonging to the coffle were now assembledeither at Kamalia or at some of the neighbouring villages, it might havebeen expected that we should set out immediately for Gambia; but thoughthe day of our departure was frequently fixed, it was always foundexpedient to change it.  Some of the people had not prepared their dryprovisions; others had gone to visit their relations; or collect sometrifling debts; and, last of all, it was necessary to consult whether theday would be a lucky one.  On account of one of these, or other suchcauses, our departure was put off, day after day, until the month ofFebruary was far advanced, after which all the slatees agreed to remainin their present quarters until the _fast moon was over_.  And here I mayremark that loss of time is an object of no great importance in the eyesof a negro.  If he has anything of consequence to perform, it is a matterof indifference to him whether he does it to-day or to-morrow, or a monthor two hence; so long as he can spend the present moment with any degreeof comfort, he gives himself very little concern about the future.</p><p> </p><p> The fast of Ramadan was observed with great strictness by all thebushreens, but instead of compelling me to follow their example, as theMoors did on a similar occasion, Karfa frankly told me that I was atliberty to pursue my own inclination.  In order, however, to manifest arespect for their religious opinions, I voluntarily fasted three days,which was thought sufficient to screen me from the reproachful epithet ofkafir.  During the fast all the slatees belonging to the coffle assembledevery morning in Karfa’s house, where the schoolmaster read to them somereligious lessons from a large folio volume, the author of which was anArab of the name of Sheiffa.  In the evening such of the women as hadembraced Mohammedanism assembled and said their prayers publicly at themissura.  They were all dressed in white, and went through the differentprostrations prescribed by their religion with becoming solemnity.Indeed, during the whole fast of Ramadan the negroes behaved themselveswith the greatest meekness and humility, forming a striking contrast tothe savage intolerance and brutal bigotry which at this periodcharacterise the Moors.</p><p> </p><p> When the fast month was almost at an end, the bushreens assembled at themissura to watch for the appearance of the new moon, but, the eveningbeing rather cloudy, they were for some time disappointed, and a numberof them had gone home with a resolution to fast another day, when on asudden this delightful object showed her sharp horns from behind a cloud,and was welcomed with the clapping of hands, beating of drums, firing ofmuskets, and other marks of rejoicing.  As this moon is reckonedextremely lucky, Karfa gave orders that all the people belonging to thecoffle should immediately pack up their dry provisions and holdthemselves in readiness; and on the 16th of April the slatees held aconsultation and fixed on the 19th of the same month as the day on whichthe coffle should depart from Kamalia.  This resolution freed me frommuch uneasiness, for our departure had already been so long deferred thatI was apprehensive it might still be put off until the commencement ofthe rainy season; and although Karfa behaved towards me with the greatestkindness, I found my situation very unpleasant.  The slatees wereunfriendly to me, and the trading Moors who were at this time at Kamaliacontinued to plot mischief against me from the first day of theirarrival.  Under these circumstances I reflected that my life in a greatmeasure depended on the good opinion of an individual who was dailyhearing malicious stories concerning the Europeans, and I could hardlyexpect that he would always judge with impartiality between me and hiscountrymen.  Time had, indeed, reconciled me in some degree to their modeof life, and a smoky hut or a scanty supper gave me no great uneasiness;but I became at last wearied out with a constant state of alarm andanxiety, and felt a painful longing for the manifold blessings ofcivilised society.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 19.—The long-wished-for day of our departure was at lengtharrived; and the slatees, having taken the irons from their slaves,assembled with them at the door of Karfa’s house, where the bundles wereall tied up, and every one had his load assigned him.  The coffle, on itsdeparture from Kamalia, consisted of twenty-seven slaves for sale, theproperty of Karfa and four other slatees; but we were afterwards joinedby five at Maraboo and three at Bala—making in all thirty-five slaves.The freemen were fourteen in number, but most of them had one or twowives and some domestic slaves; and the schoolmaster, who was now uponhis return for Woradoo, the place of his nativity, took with him eight ofhis scholars, so that the number of free people and domestic slavesamounted to thirty-eight, and the whole amount of the coffle wasseventy-three.  Among the freemen were six jillikeas (singing men), whosemusical talents were frequently exerted either to divert our fatigue orobtain us a welcome from strangers.  When we departed from Kamalia, wewere followed for about half a mile by most of the inhabitants of thetown, some of them crying and others shaking hands with their relationswho were now about to leave them; and when we had gained a piece ofrising ground, from which we had a view of Kamalia, all the peoplebelonging to the coffle were ordered to sit down in one place with theirfaces towards the west, and the townspeople were desired to sit down inanother place with their faces towards Kamalia.  In this situation theschoolmaster, with two of the principal slatees, having taken theirplaces between the two parties, pronounced a long and solemn prayer,after which they walked three times round the coffle, making animpression in the ground with the ends of their spears, and mutteringsomething by way of charm.  When this ceremony was ended, all the peoplebelonging to the coffle sprang up and, without taking a formal farewellof their friends, set forwards.  As many of the slaves had remained foryears in irons, the sudden exertion of walking quick with heavy loadsupon their heads occasioned spasmodic contractions of their legs; and wehad not proceeded above a mile before it was found necessary to take twoof them from the rope, and allow them to walk more slowly until wereached Maraboo, a walled village, where some people were waiting to jointhe coffle.  Here we stopped about two hours, to allow the strangers timeto pack up their provisions, and then continued our route to Bala, whichtown we reached about four in the afternoon.  The inhabitants of Bala atthis season of the year subsist chiefly on fish, which they take in greatplenty from the streams in the neighbourhood.  We remained here until theafternoon of the next day, the 20th, when we proceeded to Worumbang, thefrontier village of Manding, towards Jallonkadoo.  As we proposed shortlyto enter the Jallonka Wilderness, the people of this village furnished uswith great plenty of provisions, and on the morning of the 21st weentered the woods to the westward of Worumbang.  After having travelledsome little way, a consultation was held whether we should continue ourroute through the wilderness, or save one day’s provisions by going toKinytakooro, a town in Jallonkadoo.  After debating the matter for sometime, it was agreed that we should take the road for Kinytakooro; but asthat town was a long day’s journey distant, it was necessary to take somerefreshment.  Accordingly every person opened his provision-bag andbrought a handful or two of meal to the place where Karfa and the slateeswere sitting.  When every one had brought his quota, and the whole wasproperly arranged in small gourd-shells, the schoolmaster offered up ashort prayer, the substance of which was that God and the holy Prophetmight preserve us from robbers and all bad people, that our provisionsmight never fail us, nor our limbs become fatigued.  This ceremony beingended, every one partook of the meal and drank a little water, afterwhich we set forward (rather running than walking) until we came to theriver Kokoro, a branch of the Senegal, where we halted about ten minutes.The banks of this river are very high, and from the grass and brushwoodwhich had been left by the stream it was evident that at this place thewater had risen more than twenty feet perpendicular during the rainyseason.  At this time it was only a small stream, such as would turn amill, swarming with fish; and on account of the number of crocodiles, andthe danger of being carried past the ford by the force of the stream inthe rainy season, it is called _Kokoro_ (dangerous).  From this place wecontinued to travel with the greatest expedition, and in the afternooncrossed two small branches of the Kokoro.  About sunset we came in sightof Kinytakooro, a considerable town, nearly square, situated in themiddle of a large and well-cultivated plain: before we entered the town,we halted until the people who had fallen behind came up.  During thisday’s travel two slaves, a woman and a girl, belonging to a slates ofBala, were so much fatigued that they could not keep up with the coffle;they were severely whipped, and dragged along until about three o’clockin the afternoon, when they were both affected with vomiting, by which itwas discovered that they had _eaten_ clay.  This practice is by no meansuncommon amongst the negroes; but whether it arises from a vitiatedappetite, or from a settled intention to destroy themselves, I cannotaffirm.  They were permitted to lie down in the woods, and three peopleremained with them until they had rested themselves; but they did notarrive at the town until past midnight, and were then so much exhaustedthat the slatee gave up all thoughts of taking them across the woods intheir present condition, and determined to return with them to Bala andwait for another opportunity.</p><p> </p><p> As this was the first town beyond the limits of Manding, greateretiquette than usual was observed.  Every person was ordered to keep inhis proper station, and we marched towards the town in a sort ofprocession nearly as follows:—In front five or six singing men, all ofthem belonging to the coffle; these were followed by the other freepeople; then came the slaves, fastened in the usual way by a rope roundtheir necks, four of them to a rope, and a man with a spear between eachfour; after them came the domestic slaves; and in the rear the women offree condition, wives of the slatees, etc.  In this manner we proceededuntil we came within a hundred yards of the gate, when the singing menbegan a loud song, well calculated to flatter the vanity of theinhabitants, by extolling their known hospitality to strangers and theirparticular friendship for the Mandingoes.  When we entered the town weproceeded to the bentang, where the people gathered round us to hear our_dentegi_ (history); this was related publicly by two of the singingmen—they enumerated every little circumstance which had happened to thecoffle, beginning with the events of the present day and relatingeverything in a backward series until they reached Kamalia.  When thishistory was ended, the master of the town gave them a small present, andall the people of the coffle, both free and enslaved, were invited bysome person or other and accommodated with lodging and provisions for thenight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XXV.THE JALLONKA WILDERNESS; A WARLIKE TALE.</p><p> </p><p> WE continued at Kinytakooro until noon of the 22nd of April, when weremoved to a village about seven miles to the westward, the inhabitantsof which, being apprehensive of hostilities from the Foulahs of Fooladoo,were at this time employed in constructing small temporary huts among therocks, on the side of a high hill close to the village.  The situationwas almost impregnable, being everywhere surrounded with high precipices,except on the eastern side, where the natives had left a pathwaysufficient to allow one person at a time to ascend.  Upon the brow of thehill, immediately over this path, I observed several heaps of large loosestones, which the people told me were intended to be thrown down upon theFoulahs if they should attempt the hill.</p><p> </p><p> At daybreak on the 23rd we departed from this village and entered theJallonka Wilderness.  We passed in the course of the morning the ruins oftwo small towns which had lately been burnt by the Foulahs.  The firemust have been very intense, for I observed that the walls of many of thehuts were slightly vitrified, and appeared at a distance as if coveredwith a red varnish.  About ten o’clock we came to the river Wonda, whichis somewhat larger than the river Kokoro; but the stream was at this therather muddy, which Karfa assured me was occasioned by amazing shoals offish.  They were indeed seen in all directions, and in such abundancethat I fancied the water itself tasted and smelt fishy.  As soon as wehad crossed the river, Karfa gave orders that all the people of thecoffle should in future keep close together, and travel in their properstation.  The guides and young men were accordingly placed in the van,the women and slaves in the centre, and the freemen in the rear.  In thisorder we travelled with uncommon expedition through a woody but beautifulcountry, interspersed with a pleasing variety of hill and dale, andabounding with partridges, guinea-fowl, and deer, until sunset, when wearrived at a most romantic stream, called Co-meissang.  My arms and neckhaving been exposed to the sun during the whole day, and irritated by therubbing of my dress in walking, were now very much inflamed and coveredwith blisters, and I was happy to embrace the opportunity, while thecoffle rested on the bank of the river, to bathe myself in the stream.This practice, together with the cool of the evening, much diminished theinflammation.  About three miles to the westward of the Co-meissang wehalted in a thick wood and kindled our fires for the night.  We were allby this time very much fatigued, having, as I judged, travelled this daythirty miles, but no person was heard to complain.  Whilst supper waspreparing, Karfa made one of the slaves break some branches from thetrees for my bed.  When we had finished our supper of kouskous, moistenedwith some boiling water, and put the slaves in irons, we all lay down tosleep; but we were frequently disturbed in the night by the howling ofwild beasts, and we found the small brown ants very troublesome.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 24.—Before daybreak the bushreens said their morning prayers, andmost of the free people drank a little _moening_ (a sort of gruel), partof which was likewise given to such of the slaves as appeared least ableto sustain the fatigues of the day.  One of Karfa’s female slaves wasvery sulky, and when some gruel was offered to her she refused to drinkit.  As soon as day dawned we set out, and travelled the whole morningover a wild and rocky country, by which my feet were much bruised, and Iwas sadly apprehensive that I should not he able to keep up with thecoffle during the day; but I was in a great measure relieved from thisanxiety when I observed that others were more exhausted than myself.  Inparticular, the woman slave who had refused victuals in the morning begannow to lag behind, and complain dreadfully of pains in her legs.  Herload was taken from her and given to another slave, and she was orderedto keep in the front of the coffle.  About eleven o’clock, as we wereresting by a small rivulet, some of the people discovered a hive of beesin a hollow tree, and they were proceeding to obtain the honey when thelargest swarm I ever beheld flew out, and, attacking the people of thecoffle, made us fly in all directions.  I took the alarm first, and, Ibelieve, was the only person who escaped with impunity.  When our enemiesthought fit to desist from pursuing us, and every person was employed inpicking out the stings he had received, it was discovered that the poorwoman above mentioned, whose name was Nealee, was not come up; and asmany of the slaves in their retreat had left their brindles behind them,it became necessary for some persons to return and bring them.  In orderto do this with safety, fire was set to the grass a considerable way tothe eastward of the hive, and, the wind driving the fire furiously along,the party pushed through the smoke and recovered the bundles.  Theylikewise brought with them poor Nealee, whom they found lying by therivulet.  She was very much exhausted, and had crept to the stream inhopes to defend herself from the bees by throwing water over her body;but this proved ineffectual, for she was stung in the most dreadfulmanner.</p><p> </p><p> When the slatees had picked out the stings as far as they could, she waswashed with water and then rubbed with bruised leaves; but the wretchedwoman obstinately refused to proceed any farther, declaring that shewould rather die than walk another step.  As entreaties and threats wereused in vain, the whip was at length applied; and after bearing patientlya few strokes she started up and walked with tolerable expedition forfour or five hours longer, when she made an attempt to run away from thecoffle, but was so very weak that she fell down in the grass.  Though shewas unable to rise, the whip was a second time applied, but withouteffect; upon which Karfa desired two of the slatees to place her upon theass which carried our dry provisions; but she could not sit erect, andthe ass being very refractory it was found impossible to carry herforward in that manner.  The slatees, however, were unwilling to abandonher, the day’s journey being nearly ended; they therefore made a sort oflitter of bamboo-canes, upon which she was placed, and tied on it withslips of bark.  This litter was carried upon the heads of two slaves, onewalking before the other, and they were followed by two others, whorelieved them occasionally.  In this manner the woman was carried forwarduntil it was dark, when we reached a stream of water at the foot of ahigh hill called Gankaran-Kooro, and here we stopped for the night, andset about preparing our supper.  As we had only ate one handful of mealsince the preceding night, and travelled all day in a hot sun, many ofthe slaves who had loads upon their heads were very much fatigued, andsome of them _snapped their fingers_, which among the negroes is a suresign of desperation.  The slatees immediately put them all in irons, andsuch of them as had evinced signs of great despondency were kept apartfrom the rest, and had their hands tied.  In the morning they were foundgreatly recovered.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 25.—At daybreak poor Nealee was awakened, but her limbs were nowbecome so stiff and painful that she could neither walk nor stand; shewas therefore lifted, like a corpse, upon the back of the ass, and theslatees endeavoured to secure her in that situation by fastening herhands together under the ass’s neck, and her feet under the belly, withlong slips of bark; but the ass was so very unruly that no sort oftreatment could induce him to proceed with his load, and as Nealee madeno exertion to prevent herself from falling she was quickly thrown off,and had one of her legs much bruised.  Every attempt to carry her forwardbeing thus found ineffectual, the general cry of the coffle was_Kang-tegi_, _kang-tegi_ (“Cut her throat, cut her throat”)—an operationI did not wish to see performed, and therefore marched onwards with theforemost of the coffle.  I had not walked above a mile, when one ofKarfa’s domestic slaves came up to me, with poor Nealea’s garment uponthe end of his bow, and exclaimed, _Nealee affeeleeta_ (“Nealee islost”)!  I asked him whether the slatees had given him the garment as areward for cutting her throat.  He replied that Karfa and theschoolmaster would not consent to that measure, but had left her on theroad, where undoubtedly she soon perished, and was probably devoured bywild beasts.</p><p> </p><p> The sad fate of this wretched woman, notwithstanding the outcry beforementioned, made a strong impression on the mind of the whole coffle, andthe schoolmaster fasted the whole of the ensuing day in consequence ofit.  We proceeded in deep silence, and soon afterwards crossed the riverFurkoomah, which was about as large as the river Wonda.  We now travelledwith great expedition, every one being apprehensive he might otherwisemeet with the fate of poor Nealee.  It was, however, with greatdifficulty that I could keep up, although I threw away my spear andeverything that could in the least obstruct me.  About noon we saw alarge herd of elephants, but they suffered us to pass unmolested; and inthe evening we halted near a thicket of bamboo, but found no water, sothat we were forced to proceed four miles farther to a small stream,where we stopped for the night.  We had marched this day, as I judged,about twenty-six miles.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 26.—This morning two of the schoolmaster’s pupils complained muchof pains in their legs, and one of the slaves walked lame, the soles ofhis feet being very much blistered and inflamed; we proceeded,notwithstanding, and about eleven o’clock began to ascend a rocky hillcalled Boki-Kooro, and it was past two in the afternoon before we reachedthe level ground on the other side.  This was the most rocky road we hadyet encountered, and it hurt our feet much.  In a short time we arrivedat a pretty large river, called Boki, which we forded; it ran smooth andclear over a bed of whinstone.  About a mile to the westward of the riverwe came to a road which leads to the north-east towards Gadou, and seeingthe marks of many horses’ feet upon the soft sand, the slateesconjectured that a party of plunderers had lately rode that way to fallupon some town of Gadou; and lest they should discover upon their returnthat we had passed, and attempt to pursue us by the marks of our feet,the coffle was ordered to disperse and travel in a loose manner throughthe high grass and bushes.  A little before it was dark, having crossedthe ridge of hills to the westward of the river Boki, we came to a wellcalled _Cullong Qui_ (White Sand Well), and here we rested for the night.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 27.—We departed from the well early in the morning, and walked onwith the greatest alacrity, in hopes of reaching a town before night.The road during the forenoon led through extensive thickets of drybamboos.  About two o’clock we came to a stream called Nunkolo, where wewere each of us regaled with a handful of meal, which, according to asuperstitious custom, was not to be eaten until it was first moistenedwith water from this stream.  About four o’clock we reached Sooseeta, asmall Jallonka village, situated in the district of Kullo, whichcomprehends all that tract of country lying along the banks of the BlackRiver, or main branch of the Senegal.  These were the first humanhabitations we had seen since we left the village to the westward ofKinytakooro, having travelled in the course of the last five days upwardsof one hundred miles.  Here, after a great deal of entreaty, we wereprovided with huts to sleep in, but the master of the village plainlytold us that he could not give us any provisions, as there had latelybeen a great scarcity in this part of the country.  He assured us that,before they had gathered in their present crops, the whole inhabitants ofKullo had been for twenty-nine days without tasting corn, during whichtime they supported themselves entirely upon the yellow powder which isfound in the pods of the _nitta_, so called by the natives, a species ofmimosa, and upon the seeds of the bamboo-cane, which, when properlypounded and dressed, taste very much like rice.  As our dry provisionswere not yet exhausted, a considerable quantity of kouskous was dressedfor supper, and many of the villagers were invited to take part of therepast; but they made a very bad return for this kindness, for in thenight they seized upon one of the schoolmaster’s boys, who had fallenasleep under the bentang tree, and carried him away.  The boy fortunatelyawoke before he was far from the village, and, setting up a loud scream,the man who carried him put his hand upon his mouth and ran with him intothe woods; but afterwards understanding that he belonged to theschoolmaster, whose place of residence is only three days’ journeydistant, he thought, I suppose, that he could not retain him as a slavewithout the schoolmaster’s knowledge, and therefore stripped off theboy’s clothes and permitted him to return.</p><p> </p><p> _April_ 28.—Early in the morning we departed from Sooseeta, and about teno’clock came to an unwalled town, called Manna, the inhabitants of whichwere employed in collecting the fruit of the nitta-trees, which are verynumerous in this neighbourhood.  The pods are long and narrow, andcontain a few black seeds, enveloped in the fine mealy powder beforementioned; the meal itself is of a bright yellow colour, resembling theflour of sulphur, and has a sweet mucilaginous taste.  When eaten byitself it is clammy, but when mixed with milk or water it constitutes avery pleasant and nourishing article of diet.</p><p> </p><p> The language of the people of Manna is the same that is spoken all overthat extensive and hilly country called Jallonkadoo.  Some of the wordshave a great affinity to the Mandingo, but the natives themselvesconsider it as a distinct language.  Their numerals are these:—</p><p> </p><p> One        Kidding.Two        Fidding.Three      Sarra.Four       Nani.Five       Soolo.Six        Seni.Seven      Soolo ma fidding.Eight      Soolo ma sarra.Nine       Soolo ma nani.Ten        Nuff.</p><p> </p><p> The Jallonkas, like the Mandingoes, are governed by a number of pettychiefs, who are in a great measure independent of each other.  They haveno common sovereign, and the chiefs are seldom upon such terms offriendship as to assist each other even in war-time.  The chief of Manna,with a number of his people, accompanied us to the banks of the Bafing,or Black River (a principal branch of the Senegal), which we crossed upona bridge of bamboos of a very singular construction.  The river at thisplace is smooth and deep, and has very little current.  Two tall trees,when tied together by the tops, are sufficiently long to reach from oneside to the other, the roots resting upon the rocks, and the topsfloating in the water.  When a few trees have been placed in thisdirection, they are covered with dry bamboos, so as to form a floatingbridge, with a sloping gangway at each end, where the trees rest upon therocks.  This bridge is carried away every year by the swelling of theriver in the rainy season, and is constantly rebuilt by the inhabitantsof Manna, who, on that account, expect a small tribute from everypassenger.</p><p> </p><p> In the afternoon we passed several villages, at none of which we couldprocure a lodging, and in the twilight we received information that twohundred Jallonkas had assembled near a town called Melo, with a view toplunder the coffle.  This induced us to alter our course, and wetravelled with great secrecy until midnight, when we approached a towncalled Koba.  Before we entered the town the names of all the peoplebelonging to the coffle were called over, and a freeman and three slaveswere found to be missing.  Every person immediately concluded that theslaves had murdered the freeman and made their escape.  It was thereforeagreed that six people should go back as far as the last village, andendeavour to find his body, or collect some information concerning theslaves.  In the meantime the coffle was ordered to lie concealed in acotton-field near a large nitta-tree, and nobody to speak except in awhisper.  It was towards morning before the six men returned, havingheard nothing of the man or the slaves.  As none of us had tastedvictuals for the last twenty-four hours, it was agreed that we should gointo Koba and endeavour to procure some provisions.  We accordinglyentered the town before it was quite day, and Karfa purchased from thechief man, for three strings of beads, a considerable quantity of groundnuts, which we roasted and ate for breakfast.  We were afterwardsprovided with huts, and rested here for the day.</p><p> </p><p> About eleven o’clock, to our great joy and surprise, the freeman andslaves who had parted from the coffle the preceding night entered thetown.  One of the slaves, it seems, had hurt his foot, and the nightbeing very dark they soon lost sight of the coffle.  The freeman, as soonas he found himself alone with the slaves was aware of his own danger,and insisted on putting them in irons.  The slaves were at first ratherunwilling to submit, but when he threatened to stab them one by one withhis spear, they made no farther resistance; and he remained with themamong the bushes until morning, when he let them out of irons, and cameto the town in hopes of hearing which route the coffle had taken.  Theinformation that we received concerning the Jallonkas who intended to robthe coffle was this day confirmed, and we were forced to remain hereuntil the afternoon of the 30th, when Karfa hired a number of people toprotect us, and we proceeded to a village called Tinkingtang.  Departingfrom this village on the day following, we crossed a high ridge ofmountains to the west of the Black River, and travelled over a roughstony country until sunset, when we arrived at Lingicotta, a smallvillage in the district of Woradoo.  Here we shook out the last handfulof meal from our dry provision-bags, this being the second day, since wecrossed the Black River, that we had travelled from morning until nightwithout tasting one morsel of food.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 2.—We departed from Lingicotta; but the slaves being very muchfatigued, we halted for the night at a village about nine miles to thewestward, and procured some provisions through the interest of theschoolmaster, who now sent forward a messenger to Malacotta, his nativetown, to inform his friends of his arrival in the country, and to desirethem to provide the necessary quantity of victuals to entertain thecoffle for two or three days.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 3.—We set out for Malacotta, and about noon arrived at a villagenear a considerable stream of water which flows to the westward.  Here wedetermined to stop for the return of the messenger who had been sent toMalacotta the day before; and as the natives assured me there were nocrocodiles in this stream, I went and bathed myself.  Very few peoplehere can swim, for they came in numbers to dissuade me from venturinginto a pool where they said the water would come over my head.  About twoo’clock the messenger returned from Malacotta, and the schoolmaster’selder brother, being impatient to see him, came along with the messengerto meet him at this village.  The interview between the two brothers, whohad not seen each other for nine years, was very natural and affecting.They fell upon each other’s neck, and it was some time before either ofthem could speak.  At length, when the schoolmaster had a littlerecovered himself, he took his brother by the hand, and turning round,“This is the man,” said he, pointing to Karfa, “who has been my father inManding.  I would have pointed him out sooner to you, but my heart wastoo full.”</p><p> </p><p> We reached Malacotta in the evening, where we were well received.  Thisis an unwalled town.  The huts for the most part are made of split cane,twisted into a sort of wicker-work, and plastered over with mud.  Here weremained three days, and were each day presented with a bullock from theschoolmaster.  We were likewise well entertained by the townspeople, whoappear to be very active and industrious.  They make very good soap byboiling ground nuts in water, and then adding a ley of wood-ashes.  Theylikewise manufacture excellent iron, which they carry to Bondou to barterfor salt.  A party of the townspeople had lately returned from a tradingexpedition of this kind, and brought information concerning a war betweenAlmami Abdulkader, king of Foota-Torra, and Damel, king of the Jaloffs.The events of this war soon became a favourite subject with the singingmen and the common topic of conversation in all the kingdoms borderingupon the Senegal and Gambia; and, as the account is somewhat singular, Ishall here abridge it for the reader’s information.  The king ofFoota-Torra, inflamed with a zeal for propagating his religion, had sentan embassy to Damel similar to that which he had sent to Kasson, as hasbeen previously related.  The ambassador on the present occasion wasaccompanied by two of the principal bushreens, who carried each a largeknife fixed on the top of a long pole.  As soon as he had procuredadmission into the presence of Damel, and announced the pleasure of hisSovereign, he ordered the bushreens to present the emblems of hismission.  The two knives were accordingly laid before Damel, and theambassador explained himself as follows:—“With this knife,” said he,“Abdulkader will condescend to shave the head of Damel, if Damel willembrace the Mohammedan faith; and with this other knife Abdulkader willcut the throat of Damel if Damel refuses to embrace it: take yourchoice.”  Damel coolly told the ambassador that he had no choice to make;he neither chose to have his head shaved nor his throat cut; and withthis answer the ambassador was civilly dismissed.  Abdulkader took hismeasures accordingly, and with a powerful army invaded Damel’s country.The inhabitants of the towns and villages filled up their wells,destroyed their provisions, carried off their effects, and abandonedtheir dwellings as he approached.  By this means he was led on from placeto place, until he had advanced three days’ journey into the country ofthe Jaloffs.  He had, indeed, met with no opposition, but his army hadsuffered so much from the scarcity of water that several of his men haddied by the way.  This induced him to direct his march towards awatering-place in the woods, where his men, having quenched their thirstand being overcome with fatigue, lay down carelessly to sleep among thebushes.  In this situation they were attacked by Damel before daybreakand completely routed.  Many of them were trampled to death as they layasleep by the Jaloff horses; others were killed in attempting to maketheir escape; and a still greater number were taken prisoners.  Among thelatter was Abdulkader himself.  This ambitious, or, rather, franticprince, who but a month before had sent the threatening message to Damel,was now himself led into his presence as a miserable captive.  Thebehaviour of Damel on this occasion is never mentioned by the singing menbut in terms of the highest approbation; and it was indeed soextraordinary in an African prince that the reader may find it difficultto give credit to the recital.  When his royal prisoner was broughtbefore him in irons, and thrown upon the ground, the magnanimous Damel,instead of setting his foot upon his neck and stabbing him with hisspear, according to custom in such cases, addressed him asfollows:—“Abdulkader, answer me this question.  If the chance of war hadplaced me in your situation, and you in mine, how would you have treatedme?”  “I would have thrust my spear into your heart,” returnedAbdulkader, with great firmness; “and I know that a similar fate awaitsme.”  “Not so,” said Damel; “my spear is indeed red with the blood ofyour subjects, killed in battle, and I could now give it a deeper stainby dipping it in your own; but this would not build up my towns, norbring to life the thousands who fell in the woods.  I will not,therefore, kill you in cold blood, but I will retain you as my slave,until I perceive that your presence in your own kingdom will be no longerdangerous to your neighbours, and then I will consider of the proper wayof disposing of you.”  Abdulkader was accordingly retained, and worked asa slave for three months; at the end of which period Damel listened tothe solicitations of the inhabitants of Foota-Torra, and restored to themtheir king.  Strange as this story may appear, I have no doubt of thetruth of it.  It was told me at Malacotta by the negroes; it wasafterwards related to me by the Europeans on the Gambia, by some of theFrench at Goree, and confirmed by nine slaves who were taken prisonersalong with Abdulkader by the watering-place in the woods and carried inthe same ship with me to the West Indies.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER XXVI.MEETING WITH DR. LAIDLEY—RETURN TO THE COAST—VOYAGE TO ENGLAND.</p><p> </p><p> ON the 7th of May we departed from Malacotta, and having crossed the _BaLee_ (Honey River), a branch of the Senegal, we arrived in the evening ata walled town called Bintingala, where we rested two days.  From thence,in one day more, we proceeded to Dindikoo, a small town situated at thebottom of a high ridge of hills, from which this district is named_Konkodoo_ (the country of mountains).  These hills are very productiveof gold.  I was shown a small quantity of this metal which had beenlately collected: the grains were about the usual size, but much flatterthan those of Manding, and were found in white quartz, which had beenbroken to pieces by hammers.  At this town I met with a negro whose hairand skin were of a dull white colour.  He was of that sort which arecalled in the Spanish West Indies _albinos_, or white negroes.  The skinis cadaverous and unsightly, and the natives considered this complexion(I believe truly) as the effect of disease.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 11.—At daybreak we departed from Dindikoo, and, after a toilsomeday’s travel, arrived in the evening at Satadoo, the capital of adistrict of the same name.  This town was formerly of considerableextent, but many families had left it in consequence of the predatoryincursions of the Foulahs of Foota-Jalla, who made it a practice to comesecretly through the woods and carry off people from the cornfields andeven from the wells near the town.  In the afternoon of the 12th wecrossed the Falemé River, the same which I had formerly crossed at Bondouin my journey eastward.  This river, at this season of the year, iseasily forded at this place, the stream being only about two feet deep.The water is very pure, and flows rapidly over a bed of sand and gravel.We lodged for the night at a small village called Medina, the soleproperty of a Mandingo merchant who, by a long intercourse withEuropeans, has been induced to adopt some of their customs.  His victualswere served up in pewter dishes, and even his houses were built after thefashion of the English houses on the Gambia.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 13.—In the morning, as we were preparing to depart, a coffle ofslaves belonging to some Serawoolli traders crossed the river, and agreedto proceed with us to Baniserile, the capital of Dentila—a very longday’s journey from this place.  We accordingly set out together, andtravelled with great expedition through the woods until noon, when one ofthe Serawoolli slaves dropped the load from his head, for which he wassmartly whipped.  The load was replaced, but he had not proceeded above amile before he let it fall a second time, for which he received the samepunishment.  After this he travelled in great pain until about twoo’clock, when we stopped to breathe a little by a pool of water, the daybeing remarkably hot.  The poor slave was now so completely exhaustedthat his master was obliged to release him from the rope, for he laymotionless on the ground.  A Serawoolli, therefore, undertook to remainwith him and endeavour to bring him to the town during the cool of thenight; in the meanwhile we continued our route, and after a very hardday’s travel, arrived at Baniserile late in the evening.</p><p> </p><p> One of our slatees was a native of this place, from which he had beenabsent three years.  This man invited me to go with him to his house, atthe gate of which his friends met him with many expressions of joy,shaking hands with him, embracing him, and singing and dancing beforehim.  As soon as he had seated himself upon a mat by the threshold of hisdoor, a young woman (his intended bride) brought a little water in acalabash, and, kneeling down before him, desired him to wash his hands;when he had done this the girl, with a tear of joy sparkling in her eyes,drank the water—this being considered as the greatest proof she couldpossibly give him of her fidelity and attachment.  About eight o’clockthe same evening the Serawoolli who had been left in the woods to takecare of the fatigued slave returned and told us that he was dead; thegeneral opinion, however, was that he himself had killed him or left himto perish on the road, for the Serawoollies are said to be infinitelymore cruel in their treatment of slaves than the Mandingoes.  We remainedat Baniserile two days, in order to purchase native iron, shea-butter,and some other articles for sale on the Gambia; and here the slatee whohad invited me to his house, and who possessed three slaves, part of thecoffle, having obtained information that the price on the coast was verylow, determined to separate from us and remain with his slaves where hewas until an opportunity should offer of disposing of them toadvantage—giving us to understand that he should complete his nuptialswith the young woman before mentioned in the meantime.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 16.—We departed from Baniserile and travelled through thick woodsuntil noon, when we saw at a distance the town of Julifunda, but did notapproach it, as we proposed to rest for the night at a large town calledKirwani, which we reached about four o’clock in the afternoon.  This townstands in a valley, and the country for more than a mile round it iscleared of wood and well cultivated.  The inhabitants appear to be veryactive and industrious, and seem to have carried the system ofagriculture to some degree of perfection, for they collect the dung oftheir cattle into large heaps during the dry season for the purpose ofmanuring their land with it at the proper time.  I saw nothing like thisin any other part of Africa.  Near the town are several smeltingfurnaces, from which the natives obtain very good iron.  They afterwardshammer the metal into small bars, about a foot in length and two inchesin breadth, one of which bars is sufficient to make two Mandingocorn-hoes.  On the morning after our arrival we were visited by a slateeof this place, who informed Karfa that among some slaves he had latelypurchased was a native of Foota-Jalla, and as that country was at nogreat distance he could not safely employ him in the labours of thefield, lest he should effect his escape.  The slatee was thereforedesirous of exchanging this slave for one of Karfa’s, and offered somecloth and shea-butter to induce Karfa to comply with the proposal, whichwas accepted.  The slatee thereupon sent a boy to order the slave inquestion to bring him a few ground-nuts.  The poor creature soonafterwards entered the court in which we were sitting, having nosuspicion of what was negotiating, until the master caused the gate to beshut, and told him to sit down.  The slave now saw his danger, and,perceiving the gate to be shut upon him, threw down the nuts and jumpedover the fence.  He was immediately pursued and overtaken by the slatees,who brought him back and secured him in irons, after which one of Karfa’sslaves was released and delivered in exchange.  The unfortunate captivewas at first very much dejected, but in the course of a few days hismelancholy gradually subsided, and he became at length as cheerful as anyof his companions.</p><p> </p><p> Departing from Kirwani on the morning of the 20th we entered the TendaWilderness, of two days’ journey.  The woods were very thick, and thecountry shelved towards the south-west.  About ten o’clock we met acoffle of twenty-six people and seven loaded asses returning from theGambia.  Most of the men were armed with muskets, and had broad belts ofscarlet cloth over their shoulders and European hats upon their heads.They informed us that there was very little demand for slaves on thecoast, as no vessel had arrived for some months past.  On hearing thisthe Serawoollies, who had travelled with us from the Falemé River,separated themselves and their slaves from the coffle.  They had not,they said, the means of maintaining their slaves in Gambia until a vesselshould arrive, and were unwilling to sell them to disadvantage; theytherefore departed to the northward for Kajaaga.  We continued our routethrough the wilderness, and travelled all day through a rugged countrycovered with extensive thickets of bamboo.  At sunset, to our great joy,we arrived at a pool of water near a large tabba-tree, whence the placeis called Tabbagee, and here we rested a few hours.  The water at thisseason of the year is by no means plentiful in these woods, and as thedays were insufferably hot Karfa proposed to travel in the night.Accordingly about eleven o’clock the slaves were taken out of theirirons, and the people of the coffle received orders to keep closetogether, as well to prevent the slaves from attempting to escape as onaccount of the wild beasts.  We travelled with great alacrity untildaybreak, when it was discovered that a free woman had parted from thecoffle in the night; her name was called until the woods resounded, but,no answer being given, we conjectured that she had either mistaken theroad or that a lion had seized her unperceived.  At length it was agreedthat four people should go back a few miles to a small rivulet, wheresome of the coffle had stopped to drink as we passed it in the night, andthat the coffle should wait for their return.  The sun was about an hourhigh before the people came back with the woman, whom they found lyingfast asleep by the stream.  We now resumed our journey, and about eleveno’clock reached a walled town called Tambacunda, where we were wellreceived.  Here we remained four days on account of a palaver which washeld on the following occasion:—Modi Lemina, one of the slatees belongingto the coffle, had formerly married a woman of this town, who had bornehim two children; he afterwards went to Manding, and remained there eightyears without sending any account of himself during all that time to hisdeserted wife, who, seeing no prospect of his return, at the end of threeyears had married another man, to whom she had likewise borne twochildren.  Lemina now claimed his wife; but the second husband refused todeliver her up, insisting that by the laws of Africa when a man has beenthree years absent from his wife, without giving her notice of his beingalive, the woman is at liberty to marry again.  After all thecircumstances had been fully investigated in an assembly of the chiefmen, it was determined that the wife should make her choice, and be atliberty either to return to the first husband, or continue with thesecond, as she alone should think proper.  Favourable as thisdetermination was to the lady, she found it a difficult matter to make upher mind, and requested time for consideration; but I think I couldperceive that _first love_ would carry the day.  Lemina was indeedsomewhat older than his rival, but he was also much richer.  What weightthis circumstance had in the scale of his wife’s affections I pretend notto say.</p><p> </p><p> On the morning of the 26th, as we departed from Tambacunda, Karfaobserved to me that there were no shea-trees farther to the westward thanthis town.  I had collected and brought with me from Manding the leavesand flowers of this tree, but they were so greatly bruised on the roadthat I thought it best to gather another specimen at this place.  Theappearance of the fruit evidently places the shea-tree in the naturalorder of _Sapotæ_, and it has some resemblance to the _mudhuca_ treedescribed by Lieutenant Charles Hamilton in the “Asiatic Researches,”vol. i., p. 300.</p><p> </p><p> About one o’clock on the morning of the 26th we reached Sibikillin, awalled village; but the inhabitants having the character of inhospitalitytowards strangers, and of being much addicted to theft, we did not thinkproper to enter the gate.  We rested a short time under a tree, and thencontinued our route until it was dark, when we halted for the night by asmall stream running towards the Gambia.  Next day the road led over awild and rocky country, everywhere rising into hills and abounding withmonkeys and wild beasts.  In the rivulets among the hills we found greatplenty of fish.  This was a very hard day’s journey; and it was not untilsunset that we reached the village of Koomboo, near to which are theruins of a large town formerly destroyed by war.  The inhabitants ofKoomboo, like those of Sibikillin, have so bad a reputation thatstrangers seldom lodge in the village; we accordingly rested for thenight in the fields, where we erected temporary huts for our protection,there being great appearance of rain.</p><p> </p><p> _May_ 28.—We departed from Koomboo, and slept at a Foulah town, aboutseven miles to the westward; from which, on the day following, havingcrossed a considerable branch of the Gambia, called Neola Koba, wereached a well-inhabited part of the country.  Here are several townswithin sight of each other, collectively called Tenda, but each isdistinguished also by its particular name.  We lodged at one of them,called Koba Tenda, where we remained the day following, in order toprocure provisions for our support in crossing the Simbani woods.  On the30th we reached Jallacotta, a considerable town, but much infested byFoulah banditti, who come through the woods from Bondou and stealeverything they can lay their hands on.  A few days before our arrivalthey had stolen twenty head of cattle, and on the day following made asecond attempt, but were beaten off and one of them was taken prisoner.Here one of the slaves belonging to the coffle, who had travelled withgreat difficulty for the last three days, was found unable to proceed anyfarther: his master (a singing man) proposed therefore to exchange himfor a young slave girl belonging to one of the townspeople.  The poorgirl was ignorant of her fate until the bundles were all tied up in themorning, and the coffle ready to depart, when, coming with some otheryoung women to see the coffle set out, her master took her by the hand,and delivered her to the singing man.  Never was a face of serenity moresuddenly changed into one of the deepest distress; the terror shemanifested on having the load put upon her head and the rope fastenedround her neck, and the sorrow with which she bade adieu to hercompanions, were truly affecting.  About nine o’clock we crossed a largeplain covered with _ciboa_-trees (a species of palm), and came to theriver Nerico, a branch of the Gambia.  This was but a small river at thistime, but in the rainy season it is often dangerous to travellers.  Assoon as we had crossed this river, the singing men began to vociferate aparticular song, expressive of their joy at having got safe into the westcountry, or, as they expressed it, _the land of the setting sun_.  Thecountry was found to be very level, and the soil a mixture of clay andsand.  In the afternoon it rained hard, and we had recourse to the commonnegro umbrella, a large ciboa-leaf, which, being placed upon the head,completely defends the whole body from the rain.  We lodged for the nightunder the shade of a large tabba-tree, near the ruins of a village.  Onthe morning following we crossed a stream called Noulico, and about twoo’clock, to my infinite joy, I saw myself once more on the banks of theGambia, which at this place, being deep and smooth, is navigable; but thepeople told me that a little lower down the stream is so shallow that thecoffles frequently cross it on foot.</p><p> </p><p> _June_ 2.—We departed from Seesukunda and passed a number of villages, atnone of which was the coffle permitted to stop, although we were all verymuch fatigued.  It was four o’clock in the afternoon before we reachedBaraconda, where we rested one day.  Departing from Baraconda on themorning of the 4th, we reached in a few hours Medina, the capital of theking of Woolli’s dominions, from whom the reader may recollect I receivedan hospitable reception in the beginning of December, 1795, in my journeyeastward.  I immediately inquired concerning the health of my good oldbenefactor, and learned with great concern that he was dangerously ill.As Karfa would not allow the coffle to stop, I could not present myrespects to the king in person, but I sent him word by the officer towhom we paid customs that his prayers for my safety had not beenunavailing.  We continued our route until sunset, when we lodged at asmall village a little to the westward of Kootacunda, and on the dayfollowing arrived at Jindey, where, eighteen months before, I had partedfrom my friend Dr. Laidley—an interval during which I had not beheld theface of a Christian, nor once heard the delightful sound of my nativelanguage.</p><p> </p><p> Being now arrived within a short distance of Pisania, from whence myjourney originally commenced, and learning that my friend Karfa was notlikely to meet with an immediate opportunity of selling his slaves on theGambia, it occurred to me to suggest to him that he would find it for hisinterest to leave them at Jindey until a market should offer.  Karfaagreed with me in this opinion, and hired from the chief man of the townhuts for their accommodation, and a piece of land on which to employ themin raising corn and other provisions for their maintenance.  With regardto himself, he declared that he would not quit me until my departure fromAfrica.  We set out accordingly—Karfa, myself, and one of the Foulahsbelonging to the coffle—early on the morning of the 9th; but although Iwas now approaching the end of my tedious and toilsome journey, andexpected in another day to meet with countrymen and friends, I could notpart for the last time with my unfortunate fellow-travellers—doomed, as Iknew most of them to be, to a life of captivity and slavery in a foreignland—without great emotion.  During a wearisome peregrination of morethan five hundred British miles, exposed to the burning rays of atropical sun, these poor slaves, amidst their own infinitely greatersufferings, would commiserate mine, and, frequently of their own accord,bring water to quench my thirst, and at night collect branches and leavesto prepare me a bed in the wilderness.  We parted with reciprocalexpressions of regret and benediction.  My good wishes and prayers wereall I could bestow upon them, and it afforded me some consolation to betold that they were sensible I had no more to give.</p><p> </p><p> My anxiety to get forward admitting of no delay on the road, we reachedTendacunda in the evening, and were hospitably received at the house ofan aged black female called Seniora Camilla, a person who resided manyyears at the English factory and spoke our language.  I was known to herbefore I had left the Gambia at the outset of my journey, but my dressand figure were now so different from the usual appearance of a Europeanthat she was very excusable in mistaking me for a Moor.  When I told hermy name and country she surveyed me with great astonishment, and seemedunwilling to give credit to the testimony of her senses.  She assured methat none of the traders on the Gambia ever expected to see me again,having been informed long ago that the Moors of Ludamar had murdered me,as they had murdered Major Houghton.  I inquired for my two attendants,Johnson and Demba, and learnt with great sorrow that neither of them wasreturned.  Karfa, who had never before heard people converse in English,listened to us with great attention.  Everything he saw seemed wonderful.The furniture of the house, the chairs, &c., and particularly beds withcurtains, were objects of his great admiration, and he asked me athousand questions concerning the utility and necessity of differentarticles, to some of which I found it difficult to give satisfactoryanswers.</p><p> </p><p> On the morning of the 10th Mr. Robert Ainsley, having learned that I wasat Tendacunda, came to meet me, and politely offered me the use of hishorse.  He informed me that Dr. Laidley had removed all his property to aplace called Kayee, a little farther down the river, and that he was thengone to Doomasansa with his vessel to purchase rice, but would return ina day or two.  He therefore invited me to stay with him at Pisania untilthe doctor’s return.  I accepted the invitation, and being accompanied bymy friend Karfa, reached Pisania about ten o’clock.  Mr. Ainsley’sschooner was lying at anchor before the place.  This was the mostsurprising object which Karfa had yet seen.  He could not easilycomprehend the use of the masts, sails, and rigging; nor did he conceivethat it was possible, by any sort of contrivance, to make so large a bodymove forwards by the common force of the wind.  The manner of fasteningtogether the different planks which composed the vessel, and filling upthe seams so as to exclude the water, was perfectly new to him; and Ifound that the schooner, with her cable and anchor, kept Karfa in deepmeditation the greater part of the day.</p><p> </p><p> About noon on the 12th Dr. Laidley returned from Doomasansa and receivedme with great joy and satisfaction, as one risen from the dead.  Findingthat the wearing apparel which I had left under his care was not sold orsent to England, I lost no time in resuming the English dress anddisrobing my chin of its venerable encumbrance.  Karfa surveyed me in myBritish apparel with great delight, but regretted exceedingly that I hadtaken off my beard, the loss of which, he said, had converted me from aman into a boy.  Dr. Laidley readily undertook to discharge all thepecuniary engagements which I had entered into since my departure fromthe Gambia, and took my draft upon the association for the amount.  Myagreement with Karfa (as I have already related) was to pay him the valueof one prime slave, for which I had given him my bill upon Dr. Laidleybefore we departed from Kamalia; for in case of my death on the road Iwas unwilling that my benefactor should be a loser.  But this goodcreature had continued to manifest towards me so much kindness that Ithought I made him but an inadequate recompense when I told him that hewas now to receive double the sum I had originally promised; and Dr.Laidley assured him that he was ready to deliver the goods to that amountwhenever he thought proper to send for them.  Karfa was overpowered bythis unexpected token of my gratitude, and still more so when he heardthat I intended to send a handsome present to the good old schoolmaster,Fankooma, at Malacotta.  He promised to carry up the goods along with hisown; and Dr. Laidley assured him that he would exert himself in assistinghim to dispose of his slaves to the best advantage the moment a slavevessel should arrive.  These and other instances of attention andkindness shown him by Dr. Laidley were not lost upon Karfa.  He wouldoften say to me, “My journey has indeed been prosperous!” But observingthe improved state of our manufactures and our manifest superiority inthe arts of civilised life, he would sometimes appear pensive, andexclaim, with an involuntary sigh, _Fato fing inta feng_ (“Black men arenothing”)!  At other times he would ask me, with great seriousness, whatcould possibly have induced me, who was no trader, to think of exploringso miserable a country as Africa.  He meant by this to signify that,after what I must have witnessed in my own country, nothing in Africacould in his opinion deserve a moment’s attention.  I have preservedthese little traits of character in this worthy negro, not only fromregard to the man, but also because they appear to me to demonstrate thathe possessed a mind _above his condition_.  And to such of my readers aslove to contemplate human nature in all its varieties, and to trace itsprogress from rudeness to refinement, I hope the account I have given ofthis poor African will not be unacceptable.</p><p> </p><p> No European vessel had arrived at Gambia for many months previous to myreturn from the interior, and as the rainy season was now setting in Ipersuaded Karfa to return to his people at Jindey.  He parted with me onthe 14th with great tenderness; but as I had little hopes of being ableto quit Africa for the remainder of the year, I told him, as the factwas, that I expected to see him again before my departure.  In this,however, I was luckily disappointed, and my narrative now hastens to itsconclusion; for on the 15th, the ship _Charlestown_, an American vessel,commanded by Mr. Charles Harris, entered the river.  She came for slaves,intending to touch at Goree to fill up, and to proceed from thence toSouth Carolina.  As the European merchants on the Gambia had at this timea great many slaves on hand, they agreed with the captain to purchase thewhole of his cargo, consisting chiefly of rum and tobacco, and deliverhim slaves to the amount in the course of two days.  This afforded mesuch an opportunity of returning, though by a circuitous route, to mynative country as I thought was not to be neglected.  I thereforeimmediately engaged my passage in this vessel for America; and havingtaken leave of Dr. Laidley, to whose kindness I was so largely indebted,and my other friends on the river, I embarked at Kayee on the 17th day ofJune.</p><p> </p><p> Our passage down the river was tedious and fatiguing; and the weather wasso hot, moist, and unhealthy, that before our arrival at Goree four ofthe seamen, the surgeon, and three of the slaves had died of fevers.  AtGoree we were detained, for want of provisions, until the beginning ofOctober.</p><p> </p><p> The number of slaves received on board this vessel, both on the Gambiaand at Goree, was one hundred and thirty, of whom about twenty-five hadbeen, I suppose, of free condition in Africa, as most of those, beingbushreens, could write a little Arabic.  Nine of them had become captivesin the religious war between Abdulkader and Damel, mentioned in thelatter part of the preceding chapter.  Two of the others had seen me as Ipassed through Bondou, and many of them had heard of me in the interiorcountries.  My conversation with them, in their native language, gavethem great comfort; and as the surgeon was dead I consented to act in amedical capacity in his room for the remainder of the voyage.  They hadin truth need of every consolation in my power to bestow; not that Iobserved any wanton acts of cruelty practised either by the master or theseamen towards them, but the mode of confining and securing negroes inthe American slave-ships (owing chiefly to the weakness of their crews)being abundantly more rigid and severe than in British vessels employedin the same traffic, made these poor creatures to suffer greatly, and ageneral sickness prevailed amongst them.  Besides the three who died onthe Gambia, and six or eight while we remained at Goree, eleven perishedat sea, and many of the survivors were reduced to a very weak andemaciated condition.</p><p> </p><p> In the midst of these distresses the vessel, after having been threeweeks at sea, became so extremely leaky as to require constant exertionat the pumps.  It was found necessary therefore to take some of theablest of the negro men out of irons and employ them in this labour, inwhich they were often worked beyond their strength.  This produced acomplication of miseries not easily to be described.  We were, however,relieved much sooner than I expected, for, the leak continuing to gainupon us, notwithstanding our utmost exertions to clear the vessel, theseamen insisted on bearing away for the West Indies, as affording theonly chance of saving our lives.  Accordingly, after some objections onthe part of the master, we directed our course for Antigua, andfortunately made that island in about thirty-five days after ourdeparture from Goree.  Yet even at this juncture we narrowly escapeddestruction, for on approaching the north-west side of the island westruck on the Diamond Rock and got into St. John’s Harbour with greatdifficulty.  The vessel was afterwards condemned as unfit for sea, andthe slaves, as I have heard, were ordered to be sold for the benefit ofthe owners.</p><p> </p><p> At this island I remained ten days, when the _Chesterfield_ packet,homeward bound from the Leeward Islands, touching at St. John’s for theAntigua mail, I took my passage in that vessel.  We sailed on the 24th ofNovember, and after a short but tempestuous voyage arrived at Falmouth onthe 22nd of December, from whence I immediately set out for London;having been absent from England two years and seven months.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> NOTE.</p><p> </p><p> THE following passage from James Montgomery’s poem, “The West Indies,”published in 1810, was inspired by “Mungo Park’s Travels in the Interiorof Africa.”  It enshrines in English verse the beautiful incident of thenegro woman’s song of “Charity” (on page 190 of the first of these twovolumes), and closes with the poet’s blessing upon Mungo Park himself,who had sailed five years before upon the second journey, from which hehad not returned, and whose fate did not become known until five yearslater.</p><p> </p><p>     Man, through all ages of revolving time,    Unchanging man, in every varying clime,    Deems his own land of every land the pride,    Beloved by Heaven o’er all the world beside;    His home the spot of earth supremely blest,    A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest.</p><p> </p><p>        And is the Negro outlawed from his birth?    Is he alone a stranger on the earth?    Is there no shed whose peeping roof appears    So lovely that it fills his eyes with tears?    No land, whose name, in exile heard, will dart    Ice through his veins and lightning through his heart?    Ah! yes; beneath the beams of brighter skies    His home amidst his father’s country lies;    There with the partner of his soul he shares    Love-mingled pleasures, love-divided cares;    There, as with nature’s warmest filial fire,    He soothes his blind and feeds his helpless sire;    His children, sporting round his hut, behold    How they shall cherish him when he is old,    Trained by example from their tenderest youth    To deeds of charity and words of truth.    Is _he_ not blest?  Behold, at closing day,    The Negro village swarms abroad to play;    He treads the dance, through all its rapturous rounds,    To the wild music of barbarian sounds;    Or, stretched at ease where broad palmettos shower    Delicious coolness in his shadowy bower,    He feasts on tales of witchcraft, that give birth    To breathless wonder or ecstatic mirth:    Yet most delighted when, in rudest rhymes,    The minstrel wakes the song of elder times,    When men were heroes, slaves to Beauty’s charms,    And all the joys of life were love and arms.    Is not the Negro blest?  His generous soil    With harvest plenty crowns his simple toil;    More than his wants his flocks and fields afford:    He loves to greet a stranger at his board:    “The winds were roaring and the White Man fled;    The rains of night descended on his head;    The poor White Man sat down beneath our tree:    Weary and faint and far from home was he:    For him no mother fills with milk the bowl,    No wife prepares the bread to cheer his soul.    Pity the poor White Man, who sought our tree;    No wife, no mother, and no home has he.”    Thus sung the Negro’s daughters;—once again,    O that the poor White Man might hear that strain!    Whether the victim of the treacherous Moor,    Or from the Negro’s hospitable door    Spurned as a spy from Europe’s hateful clime,    And left to perish for thy country’s crime,    Or destined still, when all thy wanderings cease,    On Albion’s lovely lap to rest in peace,    Pilgrim! in heaven or earth, where’er thou be,    Angels of mercy guide and comfort thee!</p><p> </p><p> A note to the same poem gives the following record of facts,substantiated in a court of justice, in which there can be only oneanswer to the question, “Which were the savages?”</p><p> </p><p>     “In this year (1783) certain underwriters desired to be heard against    Gregson and others of Liverpool, in the case of the ship _Zong_,    Captain Collingwood, alleging that the captain and officers of the    said vessel threw overboard one hundred and thirty-two slaves alive    into the sea, in order to defraud them by claiming the value of the    said slaves, as if they had been lost in a natural way.  In the    course of the trial which afterwards came on, it appeared that the    slaves on board the _Zong_ were very sickly; that sixty of them had    already died, and several were ill and likely to die, when the    captain proposed to James Kelsal, the mate, and others to throw    several of them overboard, stating that ‘if they died a natural    death, the loss would fall upon the owners of the ship, but that if    they were thrown into the sea, it would fall upon the underwriters.’    He selected accordingly one hundred and thirty-two of the most sickly    of the slaves.  Fifty-four of these were immediately thrown    overboard, and forty-two were made to be partakers of their fate on    the succeeding day.  In the course of three days afterwards the    remaining twenty-six were brought upon deck to complete the number of    victims.  The first sixteen submitted to be thrown into the sea, but    the rest, with a noble resolution, would not suffer the offices to    touch them, but leaped after their companions and shared their fate.</p><p> </p><p>     “The plea which was set up in behalf of this atrocious and    unparalleled act of wickedness was that the captain discovered, when    he made the proposal, that he had only two hundred gallons of water    on board, and that he had missed his port.  It was proved, however,    in answer to this, that no one had been put upon short allowance; and    that, as if Providence had determined to afford an unequivocal proof    of the guilt, a shower of rain fell, and continued for three days,    immediately after the second lot of slaves had been destroyed, by    means of which they might have filled many of their vessels with    water, and thus have prevented all necessity for the destruction of    the third.</p><p> </p><p>     “Mr. Granville Sharp (who after many years of struggle first obtained    the decision of a court of justice that there _are_ no slaves in    England) was present at this trial, and procured the attendance of a    shorthand writer to take down the facts which should come out in the    course of it.  These he gave to the public afterwards.  He    communicated them also, with a copy of the trial, to the Lords of the    Admiralty, as the guardians of justice upon the seas, and to the Duke    of Portland, as principal Minister of state.  No notice, however, was    taken by any of these of the information which had been thus sent    them.”</p><p> </p><p> Another incident of the Middle Passage suggested to James Montgomery apoem called “The Voyage of the Blind.”</p><p> </p><p>     “It was that fatal and perfidious bark,    Built in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark.”</p><p> </p><p>                                                        MILTON’S _Lycidas_.</p><p> </p><p> The ship _Le Rodeur_, Captain B., of 200 tons burthen, left Havre on the24th of January, 1819, for the coast of Africa, and reached herdestination on the 14th of March following, anchoring at Bonny, on theriver Calabar.  The crew, consisting of twenty-two men, enjoyed goodhealth during the outward voyage and during their stay at Bonny, wherethey continued till the 6th of April.  They had observed no trace ofophthalmia among the natives; and it was not until fifteen days afterthey had set sail on the return voyage, and the vessel was near theequator, that they perceived the first symptoms of this frightful malady.It was then remarked that the negroes, who to the number of 160 werecrowded together in the hold and between the decks, had contracted aconsiderable redness of the eyes, which spread with singular rapidity.No great attention was at first paid to these symptoms, which werethought to be caused only by the want of air in the hold, and by thescarcity of water, which had already begun to be felt.  At this time theywere limited to eight ounces of water a day for each person, whichquantity was afterwards reduced to the half of a wine-glass.  By theadvice of M. Maugnan, the surgeon of the ship, the negroes, who hadhitherto remained shut up in the hold, were brought upon deck insuccession, in order that they might breathe a purer air.  But it becamenecessary to abandon this expedient, salutary as it was, because many ofthe negroes, affected with _nostalgia_ (a passionate longing to return totheir native land), threw themselves into the sea, locked in each other’sarms.</p><p> </p><p> The disease, which had spread itself so rapidly and frightfully among theAfricans, soon began to infect all on board.  The danger also was greatlyincreased by a malignant dysentery which prevailed at the time.  Thefirst of the crew who caught it was a sailor who slept under the decknear the grated hatch which communicated with the hold.  The next day alandsman was seized with ophthalmia; and in three days more the captainand the whole ship’s company, except one sailor, who remained at thehelm, were blinded by the disorder.</p><p> </p><p> All means of cure which the surgeon employed, while he was able to act,proved ineffectual.  The sufferings of the crew, which were otherwiseintense, were aggravated by apprehension of revolt among the negroes, andthe dread of not being able to reach the West Indies, if the only sailorwho had hitherto escaped the contagion, and on whom their whole hoperested, should lose his sight, like the rest.  This calamity had actuallybefallen the _Leon_, a Spanish vessel which the _Rodeur_ met on herpassage, and the whole of whose crew, having become blind, were under thenecessity of altogether abandoning the direction of their ship.  Theseunhappy creatures, as they passed, earnestly entreated the charitableinterference of the seamen of the _Rodeur_; but these, under their ownaffliction, could neither quit their vessel to go on board the _Leon_,nor receive the crew of the latter into the _Rodeur_, where, on accountof the cargo of negroes, there was scarcely room for themselves.  Thevessels therefore soon parted company, and the _Leon_ was never seen norheard of again, so far as could be traced at the publication of thisnarrative.  In all probability, then, it was lost.  On the fate of _this_vessel the poem is founded.</p><p> </p><p> The _Rodeur_ reached Guadaloupe on the 21st of June, 1819, her crew beingin a most deplorable condition.  Of the negroes, thirty-seven had becomeperfectly blind, twelve had lost each an eye, and fourteen remainedotherwise blemished by the disease.  Of the crew, twelve, including thesurgeon, had entirely lost their sight; five escaped with an eye each,and four were partially injured.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> FOOTNOTES.</p><p> </p><p> {7}  I should have before observed that I found the language of Bambarraa sort of corrupted Mandingo.

When he is found, a meeting is called of the chiefpeople of the place, and the debtor is compelled to ransom his friend byfulfilling his engagements.
