<p>Whilst the Manual of Military Law tended to lump ‘Negroes &c.’ with ‘aliens’, there were, in addition to British-born, domiciled Black Tommies and volunteers from the Empire, some genuine ‘aliens’ from non-British countries. One of the strangest to enlist in His Majesty’s Forces was African American Joseph Howard Lee, born in Baltimore in 1887, a travelling entertainer, vaudeville artist and lecturer, who chose to be known by the African name Bata Kindai Amgoza Ibn LoBagola. A somewhat unwholesome if colourful character, he appears to have voluntarily adopted the status of ‘alien’ in his home country and modified his racial origins and life story throughout his life. He claimed to have been born a black Jew in West Africa who ran away from home, finding his way to Glasgow as a small boy in 1896, but no evidence has been found to substantiate his Scottish childhood. Having enlisted in the US Army on 3 August 1918 as an alien in the US, which he was not, LoBagola now applied for naturalisation, which was granted. LoBagola lasted only five weeks with the US Army before being ‘honourably discharged’ under somewhat unsavoury circumstances. LoBagola’s discharge was not the end of his military career. Within a very short time he enlisted in the British Army under his adopted name in a Jewish Regiment as, following the Balfour Declaration, a British recruiting office in New York City had begun enlisting Jewish recruits for the 38th, 39th and 40th battalions of the Royal Fusiliers.</p>

<p>LoBagola claimed that it was his rejection as a black Jew which caused the social isolation that would lead him to his later conversion to the Roman Catholic Church. When things began to go wrong, LoBagola blamed his stay in the Tanta Roman Catholic School for the heavy drinking that would blight his later life and once more went on his travels, first to Cairo for a time, West Africa, and later to New York in early 1925.</p>
