</p><p> LESSON 6. How to Take Care of the Vocal Organs of Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: TAKE PROPER CARE OF THE ORGANS OF SPEECH. </p><p> Speech is formed by the action of the breath forced more or less strongly from the lungs upon the vocal cords, the sounds being modified by the palate, the tongue, the teeth, and the lips. The mouth, the nasal chambers and different parts of the throat aid in producing resonance. </p><p> The most complicated musical instrument in the world is not us wonderful nor as delicate as is the marvellous combination of the organs of speech. </p><p> To be a good speaker you must take care of every part of the body, but of the speech organs in particular. </p><p> Practise deep breathing, as already suggested, in order to improve the lungs and the throat. </p><p> Avoid all overstraining of the vocal cords. </p><p> Do not take part in prolonged cheering or hurrahing. </p><p> Do not speak for a long time in a forced, unnatural voice. </p><p> Do not make prolonged, unnatural sounds that severely tax the vocal cords. </p><p> Introduction to Book I </p><p> In Book I you are to learn how to speak correctly and! pleasingly, and how to avoid the speech errors that interfere with both the pleasure of social life and the success of business life. </p><p> The 30 lessons in Book I, in an easy and highly condensed form, show you how to master every phase of the elements of speech. Follow these lessons carefully, and you will increase your ability as a speaker tenfold. You. will be unusual in your mastery of speech. </p><p> Follow all directions faithfully. </p><p> Remember: Practice makes Perfect. </p><p> NOW, AT ONCE, BEGIN EARNEST WORK. </p><p> be careful to avoid voice strain. Learn to modulate your voice for effects. </p><p> Breathe habitually through the nose. </p><p> If you are conscious of any throat or nasal trouble, it Will pay you to consult a specialist. </p><p> Deep breathing, nasal breathing, and open air walking are the best care takers of the organs of speech. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Read the following aloud, as an exercise for the throat: Ga ge gi go gu goo gow goi </p><p> 2. Read the following aloud, as an exercise for the tongue: Thathe thi tho thu thoo thow thoi </p><p> 3. Read the following aloud, as an exercise for the teeth and tongue: Sa se si so su soo sow soi </p><p> 
LESSON 7. How to Improve the Quality of Your Voice </p><p> KEY WORDS: MAKE YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR HEALTH SUCH THAT THEY WILL LEAD TO PLEASANTNESS OF VOICE. </p><p> The voice is one of the most characteristic features of personality. Men may forget faces but they seldom forget voices. Every day you hear people speak in voices that please or displease you, and you associate voice characteristics with personal characteristics. </p><p> In other words, you judge character by voice. You are partly right, for character reacts on voice, and voice reacts on character. // you wish a good voice, cultivate a good, honest character. On the other hand, if you cultivate a good voice it will aid you in character development. </p><p> Think of three friends whom you have not seen in many months. Can you remember their voices? </p><p> Think of some person for whom you have much respect. Is the voice pleasing? </p><p> Think of some rascal whom you have known. Was his voice pleasing? </p><p> I know a public speaker who is extraordinarily popular. Crowds go to hear him whenever he speaks. His voice i3 not great and resounding. He uses no oratorical flights. He uses no "tricks" of speech. But his voice has a rich, mellow quality that pleases all; it rises and falls in modulated music, and the voice makes the thought doubly strong. </p><p> In order to cultivate a good voice it is necessary to care for the general health. </p><p> Take a brisk three-mile walk every day, and regular lung exercises, together with habitual deep breathing. That will do more for your voice than will anything else. If you have voice trouble, you may depend upon it that it is due to some lack of physical development that you can easily remedy. </p><p> Sit or stand erect, take two deep breaths, and endeavor to improve the quality of your voice. If you succeed for the moment, repeat the exercise from day to day. </p><p> Test yourself with the tape measure for lung expansion. Make your capacity well above normal. </p><p> Perhaps you have throat or nasal trouble. Give up all attempts at patent medicine cures, and consult a specialist.</p><p> Sit and stand erect; be robust and vigorous. </p><p> Cultivate self-confidence. </p><p> Practise the art of reading aloud. If possible, read to a group of three or four rather than to one. Little by little your voice will gain in power and flexibility. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEM. </p><p> Read any part of this page aloud. Try to improve the quality of your voice. Note your voice defects, and apply proper remedies.</p><p> </p><p> PROBLEM of the voice. Proper remedies. </p><p> 
LESSON 8. How to Cultivate Flexibility of Tone </p><p> KEY WORDS: MAKE YOUR SPEECH MELODIOUS THROUGH INSTANT CHANGE OF TONE. </p><p> Avoid monotony of tone. Speak, or read, with variety and constant change. </p><p> It is said that much of Mr. William J. Bryan's pleasing power of speech in the days when he first a</p><p> eared as a public speaker came from his command of tone effects, rather than from anything else. </p><p> Make your speech musical. </p><p> Avoid constant high notes that break the harmony. </p><p> Avoid deep, guttural speech that does not lend itself to music. </p><p> Avoid all raspiness, harshness, and nasality of voice. </p><p> Make the tones clear, rich, full, and extremely flexible. </p><p> Read aloud the following poem as you would ordinarily read it: </p><p> "Music, when soft voices die. Vibrates in the memory — Odors, when sweet violets sicken. Live within the sense they quicken. Rose leaves, when the rose is dead. Are heap'd for the beloved's bed; And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone, Love itself shall slumber on." </p><p> — Shelley. </p><p> Now re-read the poem, reading the following words in slightly higher tones than you read the rest, but do not increase emphasis: Music, vibrates, odors, sweet violets, live, quicken, rose leaves, thy thoughts, love. </p><p> Emphasize the thought contrasts by changing the tone, and notice how much more meaning you give the poem. </p><p> Now take up a daily newspaper, or a magazine, and read a paragraph aloud, making an effort to make your tones pleasant and varied. </p><p> Without giving your voice too great a range from high notes to low, make it flexible, make it musical, because it constantly changes its quality. Practise this tone flexibility in daily oral reading, and in your speech. </p><p> PROBLEM. Read the following in a low tone: </p><p> "Come away, come away, Death, And in sad cypress let me be laid." </p><p> "Not a flower, not a flower sweet On my black coflan let there be strown." </p><p> — Shakespeare. </p><p> Read the following in a higher tone: </p><p> "Where the bee sucks, there suck I; In a cowslip's bell I lie; There I couch when owls do cry; On the bat's back I do fly After summer merrily." </p><p> — Shakespeare. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 9. How to Avoid Nasality </p><p> KEY WORDS: CULTIVATE FULL, RICH TONES. </p><p> In the United States one of the most common fault* in speaking is nasality — "speaking through the nose," as. it is commonly called. </p><p> As a matter of fact, nasality is caused by not speaking through the nose. Take your thumb and finger, hold the nostrils tightly closed, and say this sentence aloud: "Well^ now, I'm glad you've come down to town." </p><p> You will find that closing your nostrils entirely in this way makes you speak in the dialect and tone often ascribed to up-state, farmers. </p><p> Nasality is caused by the accidental or habitual stopping of the nostrils. // your voice is nasal in tone, practise breathing through your nose. </p><p> Open your mouth more widely than usual when you speak. </p><p> Make an effort to throw the voice forward in full, rich tones. </p><p> When you are practising to avoid nasality, think of a great, round ball when you speak. Think of it so clearly that you can see it. Say this line over and over in as full, round tones as possible: "Oh, the round, round ball, it rolls and rolls around in the merry morn I" </p><p> Then think of a gigantic cannon filling the air with sound. Say aloud in full tones: "Boom! boom! boom! came from the mighty cannon's mouth !" </p><p> Make a firm resolve that you will not speak in nasal tones like a farmer. Train your ear to notice richness and fullness of sound in the speech of others, and try to imitate the most effective speech. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Say the following words, giving your speech all possible resonance: </p><p> Clang! clang! clang! boomed the great gong. </p><p> 2. Repeat the following, holding the sound as long as possible: </p><p> To whoo! To whooo! To whoooo! </p><p> 3. Make a long humming sound as you say the following: </p><p> Hummm, hummm, hummm, buzzed the bumble bee around the king. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 10. How to Pronounce Vowel Sounds Correctly </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE THE DICTIONARY AS A GUIDE TO CORRECT VOWEL SOUNDS. </p><p> Although there are only five vowels, a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes two others, w, and y, in the English language, there are in reality about forty different vowel sounds. </p><p> If you are to speak in a cultured manner you must pronounce these vowel sounds in accordance with general usage. Any good dictional^r will tell you what that general usage is. </p><p> At the bottom or at the top of every page of a good dictionary you will find a list of specimen words containing the vowel sounds. These words are marked with diacritical marks, or symbols, to show different sounds. In the front of the dictionary you will find a full explanation of every mark. </p><p> Take your dictionary now and read over the vowel sounds in the words at the bottom of any page. </p><p> You will do well if you learn the diacritical marks, although that is not necessary. </p><p> When you have read the list at least five times, turn your attention to any complete page of the dictionary. In a parenthesis following every word you will find a phonetic or sound spelling of the word, with the sounds indicated by diacritical marks corresponding to those at the bottom of the page. Read aloud every phonetic spelling on the page, paying attention to nothing but vowel sounds. The exercise is so simple and so short that it . will take only a few minutes. </p><p> Repeat the process of reading a page phonetically every day, and you will soon find, not only that you have unconsciously memorized the diacritical marks, but that you have actually mastered vowel sounds. </p><p> Go through the following vowel exercises: </p><p> 1. Ah. Open the mouth wide, and lower the tongue, holding its tip against the lower teeth. Say the following words: far, mar, car, star, tar, father. </p><p> 2. A. Open the mouth less widely than before, hold the tongue slightly raised, but touch the lower teeth with its tip. Say the following words: ape, cape, lake, rate, state, mate, came, date. </p><p> 3. EE. Hold the tongue as directed in **2'A,** but bring the teeth somewhat closely together. Say the following words: me, see, tree, bee, free, knee, feel, heel. </p><p> 4. Aw. Open the mouth to a fair degree, slightly arch the tongue and extend the lips. Say the following words: paw, daw, raw, saw, law, jaw, brawn, lawn. </p><p> 5. Oh. Bring the lips into a circle, at the same time projecting them forward a little. Touch the lower teeth with the tip of the tongue. Say the following words: dome, home, blow, know, go, low, so, toe, woe, foe. </p><p> 6. Oo. Hold the lips and tongue as just directed hut make the circle of the lips smaller. Say the following words: tooth, woo, coo, loom, boom, moon, balloon. </p><p> 7. Now take eacch of the following consonant combinations, and say it with every one of the six important vowel sounds just given: </p><p> bl 
kl 
si 
sw

Pr 
spr 
wh 
gl 
shr 
St 
gr 
sk 
str </p><p> PROBLEM. </p><p> Read the following list of words, pronouncing every word carefully. Notice that every word calls for a separate and distinct vowel sound. These words are typical of all ordinary vowel sounds in English. </p><p> a pale </p><p> bold </p><p> 00 mood </p><p> palate </p><p> obedient </p><p> good </p><p> dare </p><p> absorb </p><p> rain </p><p> sod </p><p> ou pout </p><p> accede </p><p> loft </p><p> armor </p><p> construct </p><p> oi loiter </p><p> task </p><p> Cora </p><p> u amuse united </p><p> e event </p><p> burn </p><p> lend </p><p> sup </p><p> decent </p><p> stump </p><p> walker </p><p> menu </p><p> i mice </p><p> pill </p><p> 
LESSON 11. How to Pronounce Consonant Sounds Correctly </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE THE DICTIONARY AS A GUIDE TO CONSONANT SOUNDS, </p><p> If you have been accustomed to speaking a foreign language you are likely to have difficulty in pronouncing some of the English consonant sounds. You may not even he aware that you speak incorrectly. </p><p> Turn to the front of any good dictionary, to the part ivhere various sounds are explained. </p><p> Study the formation of consonant sounds. You will find full directions for the use of the tongue, the lips, the teeth, and the speech organs in general. </p><p> Follow those directions faithfully. There are no better directions given anywhere. You may rely upon it that you are consulting a recognized authority that none will dispute. </p><p> For your convenience you will find short directions in this work, in Lesson 13, on pages 53-61. </p><p> When you have mastered the way to use the organs of speech in producing any consonant sound, practise pronouncing the various words given as examples. Be sure you follow the directions for the use of the lips, ieeth, tongue, etc.  </p><p> When this has been done, turn to any page of the dictionary and pronounce the words on that page, trying to pronounce every consonant sound as you have been directed. </p><p> Whenever you are in doubt, refer at once to the directions for the use of the lips, teeth, tongue, etc., for producing the particular sound. </p><p> Repeat the exercise frequently, using the dictionary as a driUmaster, and you will soon speak unusually well. </p><p> 
PROBLEM. </p><p> Read aloud the following combinations of consonants and vowels, saying every sound with unusual distinctness. </p><p> ba be bi bo bu boo bow boi </p><p> da de di do du doo dow doi </p><p> fa f e f i f o f u f oo f ow f oi </p><p> ga ge gi go gu goo gow goi </p><p> ha he hi ho hu hoo how hoi </p><p> ja je ji jo ju joo jow joi </p><p> ka ke ki ko ku koo kow koi </p><p> la le li lo lu loo low loi </p><p> ma me mi mo mu moo mow moi </p><p> na ne ni no nu noo now noi </p><p> pa pe pi po pu poo pow poi </p><p> ra re ri ro ru roo row roi </p><p> sa se si so su soo sow soi </p><p> ta te ti to tu too tow toi </p><p> va ve vi vo vu voo vow voi </p><p> wa we wi wo wu woo wow woi </p><p> ya ye yi yo yu yoo yow yoi </p><p> za ze zi zo zu zoo zow zoi </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 12. How to Master Syllabification </p><p> KEY WORDS: SOUND EVERY SYLLABLE THAT SHOULD BE SOUNDED. </p><p> One of the most common faults in speech is the failure to pronounce every syllable that should be pronounced. </p><p> A great many people speak somewhat as follows: </p><p> ^'Lo, Jim. Wotcha doin?" </p><p> "Nuthin." </p><p> "Lessgo over by the fakry an see if they're playngame." </p><p> **Right. Comelong." </p><p> This is really the speech of hundreds of thousands of people every day. </p><p> The fault lies in the failure to pronounce all the syllables. </p><p> Now let us look at the conversation again. </p><p> "Hello, Jim. What are you doing?" </p><p> "Nothing."  </p><p> "Let's go over by the factory and see if they're playing a game." </p><p> "All right. Come along." </p><p> The black face type indicates the syllables that were omitted originally. Count them. There are thirteen that were not sounded fully, if at sAl, </p><p> Now read the conversation, sounding every syllable as fully as possible. The effect is as displeasing as the first. </p><p> The ride for syllabification is: Sound every syllable that should be sounded, but do not make speech unnatural or artificial. </p><p> Whoever you are, it is almost certain that you slur many of your syllables. </p><p> Bead this page aloud, making sure that you pronounce every syllable fully. Make your -speech somewhat artificial for the reading. </p><p> Read a hundred words in this way every day until you have cured yourself of slurring speech. </p><p> Give thought to the matter and you will easily become correct in syllabification. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEMS: </p><p> Read the following aloud, being careful to sound every syllable in every word: </p><p> My mem-o-ry for per-son-al af -fairs is sat-is-fac-tory, but for com-mer-cial matters it is in-cor-rect. </p><p> Read the following words, carefully sounding every syllable: </p><p> in-tro-duce </p><p> tel-e-gram </p><p> tei-e-phoneoc-ca-sion de-vel-op-ing su-per-in-ten-dent dis-a-gree-a-ble or-gan-i-za-tion il-lus-tra-tion prob-a-bil-i-ty </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 13. How to Master Enunciation </p><p> KEY WORDS: MAKE YOUR ENUNCIATION CLEAR AND DISTINCT. </p><p> When you speak with proper enunciation you produce every sound clearly and unmistakably. </p><p> Proper enunciation calls for care in speaking. Your practice with the dictionary in Lessons 10 and 11 has already taught you how to produce the various sounds. You must now make a determined effort to form the habit of always producing every sound clearly, so that it cannot be mistaken. </p><p> Turn to the exercises on the following pages for directions for the use of the tongue, teeth and lips in producing sounds, and test yourself. </p><p> Find exactly what your individual failure is. </p><p> Make a list of words containing the sounds in which you are deficient. </p><p> Practise on your own list until you believe that you have succeeded. </p><p> Test yourself by the directions for sound formation and by listening to the speech of good speakers. </p><p> Consult any good dictionary for further help. </p><p> Here is a list of speech sounds for every consonant sound common in English. The list has been arranged in the form of paragraphs. </p><p> Read the words in this list over aloud, being careful to give every sound its full value. </p><p> If you find difficulty anywhere, practise all the more along the line of your individual need. </p><p> Read the words in a loud, clear whisper. In that way you will learn quickly and easily how to produce every sound. </p><p> B SOUNDS. Close the lips entirely. Then force the breath through the lips, producing voice. </p><p> The humbled boatman rubbed his brown face in bewilderment. He blamed nobody for the loss of his Bibles, the baneful injury to his back, nor even for the broken ribs of his bark. </p><p> C SOUNDS. </p><p> (See S or K sounds.) </p><p> D SOUNDS. </p><p> Place the point of the tongue on the gums of the u</p><p> er front teeth. With the lips slightly open produce voice. </p><p> Dora dwelt by the dreamy downs. She idled in her garden, with no maids to deck her dutiously with dainty delights. The breadth of the garden was like one of her breadths of brocade. Idle, she wandered with neither needles nor brush. Sadly she murmured: "Thou didst love me once, dear heart, dear knight of mine!" </p><p> F SOUNDS. Place the lower lip gently against the upper teeth and breathe without voice. </p><p> Fancy, the friend of those bereft of all but trifles, flutters like a fairy before them and softens the hard gifts that find their way under the roofs of the poor, not in the twelfth month alone but in every month. By this, forlorn folk, thou laugh'st at poverty. </p><p> G SOUNDS. Bring the hack of the tongue and the hack of the palate together in order to stop voice-producing breath. </p><p> The gold lay in gleaming piles beside the ghastly, grewsome bones. Nevertheless, medals, Georges, bars and slugs we lugged it all aboard our modem galley. </p><p> H SOUNDS. Open the mouth and breathe strongly against the vocal cords, immediately before saying any vowel sound. </p><p> Happiness helps us hold home and hearth, and raises us to heavenly heights, says Hubert Holcomb. </p><p> J SOUNDS. Place the tip of the tongue on the hack of the u</p><p> er front gums as if to say "d/' then combine **d** with **zh," by moving the tip of the tongue a very little back from the gums and breathing with voice. J is a combination of d and zh. </p><p> Judge and jury, prisoner and jailer, all have joined the general silence and stand before the common Judge of all. </p><p> K SOUNDS. </p><p> Bring the back of the tongue and the back of the palate together as in saying "g," but breathe without voice. </p><p> I beckoned and the child crept to me and clung with kisses. She knew her uncle's heart, and coaxed me like a coquette with queer little glances. My heart quickened at her tricks, for my nature weakens whenever the pretty vixen sees me, or has even looked my way. </p><p> L. SOUNDS. </p><p> Put the tip of the tongue on the back upper gums as if to say *'d*' and breathe with voice, letting the breath out ai one side, or both sides, of the tongue. </p><p> Long and lazy days we sprawled in the woods and hills in a wealth of beauty. With bulb and film we pictured the scenes. Then the elf came into our lives and overwhelmed us with joy. Our hearts were swollen, all problems were solved and we lived in castles of air such as love alone builds. Then fate dealt us the blow and convulsed us beyond all help. Our hopes had been false, our castles were engulfed in, despair, and our lives were nothing but broken hulks. The results of our films, put away on dusty shelves, are all that is left of twelve weeks in those foot hills of the Alps. And that explains why, when I had milked the cow, I looked long down the gulch into the distant trees, and gulped down a sob. </p><p> M SOUNDS. </p><p> Put the lips together, and breathe vMh voice, letting the sound into the nasal cavity. </p><p> Man3* an unkempt, unnamed man harS triumphed in some magnanimous deed. Some divine warmth, some reminiscence of early dreams, has turned him from a vagabond and tramp into a man who triumphs. </p><p> N SOUNDS. </p><p> Put the point of the tongue against the gums of the upper teeth as if to say "d" or "t." Lower the soft palate and breathe with voice, letting the sound pass into the nasal cavity, </p><p> The President never winced at his friend's unfriendly and ignoble response. The man's clenched fists, his attitude of one about to lunge and strike, did not move him. For the tenth time the Prince repeated his remark. </p><p> P SOUNDS. </p><p> Close the lips entirely. Then force the breath through the lips without producing voice. </p><p> The porter of the parlor car accepted the professor's apples, put them on a platter, added some grapes, and to</p><p> led down the aisle with the air of a man to whom nothing new ever ha</p><p> ens. But something new happened this time. Not a minute had elapsed, and he was still in the depth of profound calm, when he saw the professor tremble like an aspen and point directly at him. </p><p>  Q SOUNDS. (See K. Q is usually equal to K and W.) (It is sometimes equal to K.) The Queen was a coquette. </p><p> R SOUNDS. Move the tip of the tongue near the hack of the u</p><p> er front teeth, or near the hard palate, producing breath and voice. </p><p> Robert Burns proved that a man of worth deserves rewards, even if not marked by education. He charmed the rich and earned the love of the poor. His works have been preserved while the works of some of his contemporaries have been whirled to oblivion. A third part of the world knows of his work, a nation cherishes his old farm, and the very birds of Scotland chirp the merrier because of him. He lived, as it were, in the suburbs of real life, without having the nervous force to scorn his temptations, trials, and fears. Disturbed in his ideals, he turned from the sod and turf, from rolling moor and country ford, to meet the barbs of life in Edinburgh. The cold heart of the city was the deadly berg on which his career was wrecked. </p><p> S SOUNDS. Put the tongue almost into contact with the teeth so that it will produce friction of the breath. </p><p> Sir Walter Scott basked in the sunshine of fortune. As if on« from another sphere he welcomed his guests into his splendid lidme. Sprightly and swift, dressed in slightly elaborate garments, he was the life of all.'' His fire of hospitality never smouldered. When he spoke in his great square room the very air bristled with interest. The dogs stopped their snarling, the servants stopped their tasks, and everyone hastened to listen. The light of his friendly fire still glistens, and Scotland still clasps his hand. </p><p> T SOUNDS. Place the point of the tongue on the gums of the u</p><p> er front teeth. With the lips slightly open breathe without voice, and immediately pronounce any vowel sound. </p><p> Tennyson, true to the subtle spirit of poetry, startles no one with vulgarity. The twice born greatness of metre and of thought brightens his work. All that he writes is embattled manhood, in array against the vulgar and the evil. Many a recent poet has said to him in his heart, "Tennyson, Thou put'st me to shame.'' </p><p> V SOUNDS. </p><p> Place the lower lip gently against the upper teeth, breathe, with voice, and immediately pronounce any vowel sound. </p><p> Vanity Fair is any place where people are frivolous and more fond of laughter and revel than they are of virtue. The sloven, the depraved, are no more purchasers or vendors at Vanity Fair than are the workers and the virtuous, who buy from its shelves unlimited folly at the cost of character. </p><p> W SOUNDS. Bring the lips almost together, almost but not quite stopping the breath, breathe with voice, and immediately pronounce any vowel sound, saying it with some force. Wednesday is named for Woden, the world god of the warlike, winter loving Northmen. </p><p> X SOUNDS. (X is equal to ks, sh, gz, or z.) </p><p> The box of wax by the mast made him anxious that the King should exhibit no curiosity while on board the </p><p> Y SOUNDS. (Consonant.) Bring the tongue close to the palate, breathe with voice, and immediately pronounce any vowel sound. </p><p> Years and years ago, in the days of yore, the English yeomen used bows of yew. </p><p> Z SOUNDS. Bring the tongue very close to the hack of the gums of the upper teeth, breathe with voice, and immediately pronounce any vowel sound. </p><p> The Zebra, using natural reason, hid in such a way as to puzzle the sailors. The zealous boatswain gazed in a puzzled manner, and then gave vent to his criticism of the hunters, and of zebras in general. </p><p> CONSONANT COMBINATIONS. Notice the different ways in which the same consonant combinations in the following paragraphs are pronounced: </p><p> CH SOUNDS. The child held the watch without a question, for he did not know that human nature is such that all are not righteous. Meanwhile the thief smiled behind his mustache in a somewhat chivalrous way, as if he echoed little Enoch's cherubic soul. </p><p> GH SOUNDS. The ghostly bells of a vanished sleigh came to him in the midst of his daughters' laughter. </p><p> NG SOUNDS. Sing as long as you can, young King. Hard days are coming when your finger will no more make men tremble. </p><p> PH SOUNDS. Stephen went to the pharmacy for diphtheria antitoxine. </p><p> SH SOUNDS. The azure sky over the ocean took away all that was vicious in the man's nature. He was not conscious of the change that had taken place since he had boarded the "Fuchsia". </p><p> TH SOUNDS. "At birth the child can scarcely breathe unaided. The myths of children like Hercules, who strangled serpents, are wholly false.And yet the truths of myths are evident. The breath of idealism is their fundamental truth," says Thomas Carey, of the New Isthmus school. </p><p> WH SOUNDS. "Wh," curiously enough, should most often be pronounced "hw." </p><p> When and where will you go, and whom will you take, and why? </p><p> PROBLEM. </p><p> Read aloud a paragraph from any newspaper, being careful to enunciate every consonant sound correctly and fully. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 14. How to Learn Correct Pronunciation </p><p> KEY WORDS: CULTIVATE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION BY CONSTANT USE OF THE DICTIONARY. </p><p> Now that you have mastered the sounds of the English language, you may easily gain the ability to pronounce wor,ds correctly. </p><p> The method is very simple. Form the dictionary habit. </p><p> Buy an abridged dictionary, such as can be purchased for one or two dollars. </p><p> Place it on your desk, and refer to it in working hours. </p><p> These small dictionaries will give you all the aid you are likely to need, without giving you the burden of handling large, heavy volumes. </p><p> Be proud of your dictionary habit, and speak in accordance with the recognized authority. </p><p> Do not make the mistake of correcting the pronunciation of your friends. Few things are more annoying than to have one's pronunciation constantly questioned. Speak correctly yourself, setting a good example, but do not try to force your pronunciation upon others. </p><p> Be particularly careful in pronouncing foreign names. As foreign names -take their places in the news of the day the current periodicals give their proper pronunciations. Make written or mental note, and be exact in your use of foreign term?. </p><p> Be ready at any time to quote the authority on which you base your pronunciation. </p><p> PROBLEM. </p><p> Look up the pronunciation of every one of the following words, and pronounce every word correctly: </p><p> </p><p> half </p><p> lamentable </p><p> gratis </p><p> sacrifice </p><p> decorous </p><p> neurasthenia </p><p> allies </p><p> banana </p><p> despicable </p><p> municipal </p><p> a</p><p> aratus </p><p> irrevocable </p><p> poem </p><p> champion </p><p> literature </p><p> inexplicable </p><p> Italian </p><p> implacable </p><p> finale </p><p> genuine </p><p> 
LESSON 15. How to Avoid Typical Speech Errors </p><p> KEY WORDS: PRONOUNCE EVERY WORD CAREFULLY. </p><p> In your daily speech you mispronounce many common words. You do this, unconsciously, because of three influences: </p><p> 1. You speak in a hurry. </p><p> 2. You hear ignorant people speak incorrectly. </p><p> 3. You hear foreigners speak incorrectly. Here is what you should do: </p><p> 1. Associate as mtich as possible with people who speak correctly. </p><p> 2. Notice the speech of well-educated people. 8. Speak slowly and carefully. </p><p> 4. Sound every syllable. </p><p> Here is a list of errors that are very common: </p><p> Study the list to find your own errors, and then do all in your power to break your bad speech habits. </p><p> adeen for eiGHTeen afer for af Ter ain't for am not atchel for actUal akracy for accUracy an for and </p><p> aroplane for aEroplane awn for On stonish for A-stonish bat for baD beasly for beasTly bein for beinG berl for boll boddle for boTTle bring-ging for bringing buttah for butteR budder for buTTer capn for capTain charakter for chARacter carrr for caR champeen for champION Cherman for G-erman childern for childRen choined for Joined chon for J-ohn clazzify for claSSify comin for cominG commere for coME HERE coojoo for COULD YOU corpse for corps (Kore) </p><p> coulda for could HAVE </p><p> crick for crEEk </p><p> dat for THat. </p><p> day for THey </p><p> de for THe</p><p> deef for deaf (def) </p><p> den for THen </p><p> dep for depTH </p><p> dere for THere </p><p> dese for THese </p><p> dis for THis </p><p> doncha for don'T YOU </p><p> dunno for don'T KNOW </p><p> dooty for dUty </p><p> draf for draf T </p><p> drawring for draw-ING </p><p> eight for eighTH </p><p> erl for OIL </p><p> erster for OYster </p><p> et for Ate </p><p> everbody for everYbody </p><p> fadder for faTHer </p><p> fi cents for fiVe cents </p><p> fif for fifTH </p><p> figger for fiGUre </p><p> foist for first </p><p> for for f OUr </p><p> fur for f Or </p><p> fren for f rienD </p><p> gimmy for giVe ME </p><p> git for gEt </p><p> goil for girl (gerl) </p><p> goin for goinG </p><p> goink for goinG </p><p> guez for gueSS </p><p> gwan for gO On </p><p> ^ovmunt for govERNmEnt </p><p> hankchicfforhandKERchief </p><p> hat for haD </p><p> hold for hEARd </p><p> histry for histOry </p><p> heist for hOIst </p><p> horspital for hoSpital </p><p> howjedo for how DO YOU do </p><p> idear for ideA </p><p> ijit.for iDiot </p><p> injine for Engine </p><p> inter for intO </p><p> izzy for IS HE </p><p> jedgment for judgment </p><p> jist for jUst </p><p> Joiman for GeRman </p><p> joinal for joUmal </p><p> Joo for Jew (U) </p><p> Jooly for JUly </p><p> joose for jUice </p><p> ketch for cAtch </p><p> kink for kinG </p><p> lanlord for lanDlord </p><p> lanlady for lanDlady </p><p> launress for launDress </p><p> lenth for lenGth </p><p> literachoor for literaTUre </p><p> lookit for look at </p><p> lor for lAw </p><p> mudder for moTHer </p><p> naow for nOW </p><p> noo for nEW (NU) </p><p> nother for A-nother </p><p> orf for oFF </p><p> orf ully for AWf ully </p><p> orfice for oFFice </p><p> orstrich for OStrich </p><p> piper for pAper </p><p> pleasss for pleaSE </p><p> poil for pEARl (perl) </p><p> pome for poEM </p><p> pore for pOOr </p><p> perceed for PROceed </p><p> projeck for projecT </p><p> poopil for pUpil </p><p> put (as in putty) forpUt </p><p> quite for quiET </p><p> repas for repasT </p><p> respeck for respecT </p><p> respeckable for respecTable </p><p> resraunt for resTAUrant </p><p> resoom for resUme </p><p> rink for rinG </p><p> ror for rAw saownd for sOUNd sawr for saW seddle for seTTle seere for see HERE seprate for sepArate sing-ging for singing sompin for someTHing </p><p> onless for Unless utmos for utmosT vriety for vAriety vas for vasT verdick for verdicT vilyon for villain wadder for waTer </p><p> speriment for EXperimEnt wan for One </p><p> strenth for strenGth teayter for THeater thing for thinK ting for THing tink for THink thoid for thIRd tief for THief toin for tUrn toon for tUne Toosday for TUEsday tot for THought tousand for THousand tree for THree troat for THRoat troo for THRough trow for THROW umbreller for umbrelLA </p><p> Buy a small vest-pocket dictionary such as can be bought in any book store. </p><p> Put it in your pocket and use it whenever you are in doubt.

Therefore, we listen with interest. </p><p> Cultivate the changing music of the voice and make your speech melodious. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEM. </p><p> Read the following aloud, making an especial effort to give the voice flexibility and melody: </p><p> "The splendor falls on castle walls And snowy summits famed in story, </p><p> The long light shakes across the lakes. And the wild cataract leaps in glory:— Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying, — Blow, bugle answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying." </p><p> — Tennyson. </p><p> With native-born Americans, or with those who speak without any trace of accent. </p><p> Go to hear the best speakers. </p><p> There are innumerable chances to hear good lectures. Avail yourself of every opportunity. Study speech methods carefully. Notice what methods please you, and what methods bore you. Then imitate the best methods. </p><p> Join a society of some sort, and gain opportunity for public speech. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Name five really good speakers whom you have heard. </p><p> 2. Name five really good addresses that you have read. </p><p> 3. What excellent speakers do you intend to hear soon? </p><p> 4. What book do you possess containing good speeches? </p><p> 5. Of what opportunities for public speaking have you availed yourself recently? </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 30. How to Improve Your Speech by Reading Aloud </p><p> KEY WORDS: FORM THE HABIT OF READING ALOUD EVERY DAY. </p><p> There is no better wait by which to make your speech effective than the practice of reading aloud. </p><p> Suppose you are in your home circle. It is probable that you will have several eager listeners. </p><p> Read aloud short items of interest from the daily papers, or short articles from current periodicals. I </p><p> If you try to read an entire book aloud you will meet with so many interruptions that you will be discouraged. </p><p> There is always the opportunity for reading a short item or article. Avail yourself of that opportunity. </p><p> The psychological effect on yourself will astonish you. You have an audience. </p><p> You wish your audience to hear you; therefore, raise your voice, and gain in reaching power. </p><p> You wish your audience to understand you fully, without asking you to repeat. Therefore, enunciate sounds far more clearly than usual. </p><p> You wish your audience to be interested. Therefore, read with expression. </p><p> Practise reading aloud, whatever else you do. </p><p> The effect of this stimulus day after day is to form a habit of correct enunciation. </p><p> A winter's reading aloud in the home will do more in giving effective speech training than will much hard study. </p><p> You will find also that home reading will lead you naturally to public reading and to public speaking. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. How many minutes in the past month have you given to reading aloud? </p><p> 2. Take up a newspaper and read aloud some humorous item in a way that would interest a child. </p><p> 3. Take up a letter from your desk and read it aloud in such a way that it will reflect the personality of the writer. </p><p> Conclusion to Book I </p><p> 
In Book I you have mastered the details of speech, and have learned how to avoid the faiilts that mark poor speakers. You have now become a far more excellent speaker than is the average person. During the rest of your study in this course return occasionally to Book I, and review the work here presented. In that way you will make your mastery permanent. </p><p> In Book II you will learn how to use words effectively. Book II will show you how easy it is to gain a large vocabulary, and to use words with striking force. </p><p> Book I has made you a master of speech. Book II will make you a master of language. </p><p> 
LESSON 42. How to Use the Eyes While Speaking </p><p> KEY WORDS: LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THOSE TO WHOM YOU SPEAK. </p><p> Answer this question: Why does an animal trainer keep his eyes upon the eyes of the animals he is training? </p><p> Some years ago I gave a lecture in a Coney Island halL On the evening of the lecture I found the hall crowded* To my surprise the person in charge came to me and. said: "We're going to have trouble. We'd better send for the police. In the first two rows there's a gang come to break up the lecture. Don't try to start the lecture now." </p><p> I laughed, because I really liked the situation. Here was an audience that wouldn't go to sleep, whatever else it did. </p><p> I took a common chair, went to the very front of the room, sat down, and looked into the eyes of the men, one after another, in the first two rows. I did not glare — just looked with a friendly smile, as a good-natured wrestler might look at a big opponent. </p><p> Then I arose and began to speak. I spoke directly to the men in the first two rows. I looked into their eyes. I addressed rhetorical questions to them, and I always spoke loudly enough for the entire audience to hear.  </p><p> Two rows of people stood around the walls of the room, every seat was filled, and the quietest, most attentive people in the great avMence were the people in the first two rows. I had my eyes on them in a friendly way, and they knew it! </p><p> And after the lecture "the gang" came to me with questions and handshaking, and said they'd had a "bully" time, better than they had expected. </p><p> A steady, direct look makes speech doubly effective, for it invariably carries the impression of manliness and of power. </p><p> It is pleasing to a person who speaks to you, because it shows him that you are attentive. The fact that you fix your eyes upon his shows him that you are interested in him and in his subject. Your direct look compliments him, and will make him remember you. </p><p> The direct look reacts upon yourself. It concentrates your attention and makes you a good listener. </p><p> The habit of concentration thus established, adds immensely to your personal power. Your memory improves and your judgments become more accurate. </p><p> The direct look places you in a commanding position and you find yourself easily master of any conversation into which you enter. </p><p> You feel a distinct gain in manliness. </p><p> The man who looks into the eyes of those with whom he speaks is always a master of men. </p><p> The clear, direct look searches out and exposes fraud and deception; it looks into character, and shows you the real self of the person with whom you speak. </p><p> If you speak in public, whether to a large or to a small audience, look your audience in the face. If you allow your attention to fix itself upon notes or manuscript, or if you look at some vague point before you, you lose touch with your hearers.' </p><p> Look into the eyes of all — ^not simply of those in the center, but into the eyes of all — at the right, at the left, on the platform with you, and you will establish a magnetic bond that will not easily be broken. </p><p> Whether, with one person or with a thousand, look into the eyes of your hearers. Let your personality meet theirs. Let there he a meeting of souls. </p><p> Speak eye to eye, and heart to heart, not occasionally, but always; not alone with your intimate friends, but with all with whom you speak. It will help in making you a master of speech and a leader of men. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. During the course of a single day observe the eyes of people who talk with you. </p><p> 2. Notice which persons appeal to you as good talkers. </p><p> 3. Notice public speakers whom you hear, and observe the use of the eyes. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 43. How to Make Facial Expression Aid Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: MAKE YOUR LOOKS EXPRESS YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN YOU SPEAK. </p><p> An open countenance that reflects an honest soul pleases everyone. </p><p> As you talk, whether to one person or to a thousand,, let your face light up with the changing emotions of what you say. </p><p> Such looks are contagious, and they aid in carrying your thought to your hearers. They draw attention and thus awaken interest. </p><p> An old man stands every day on one of the crowded streets of New York and sells a cheap mechanical device. As he demonstrates, he talks. His face is a study. As he explains the little contrivance, his countenance lights up, grows serious, changes — ^he looks at you kindly, and you feel that he is explaining one of the marvels of the age. Consciously or unconsciously, he is using his expression as part of his demonstration. </p><p> The man with the speaking countenance will succeed in life far more easily than will one who hides his personality under a real, or an assumed, mask of stolidity. </p><p> When you listen let your face reflect the changing emotions of what you hear. The one who speaks recognizes your understanding and sympathy and comes more fully into touch with you. </p><p> When you speak in public let your face light and change with all the emotions of what you say, and make a double appeal to your audience. In every probability you will carry your hearers with you. </p><p> Nothing in all the world of speech is more delightful than radiancy of countenance. Men commonly associate it with genius. </p><p> Speech is only a sort of telegraph between souls. The lighting countenance is another means of sending the message. It brings personalities close together. </p><p> Some races have priced themselves on stolidity of impression, but such races have lived in an environment where stolidity is necessary to life. Our environment demands free and close communion between men. </p><p> Your success in social, and in business life, largely depends upon your maintenance of a character that is always ready to show itself in both words and looks when you speak. </p><p> Complete harmony between words and looks will make you a good speaker. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. As you go about your daily business notice the expressions of people who say only one or two words to you. Which do you regard as the better speakers? </p><p> 2. Try the experiment of speaking with proper expressiveness of countenance, and note the result. </p><p> 3. Notice the expressions of people*to whom you speak at length. How do they affect you? </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 44. How to Be a Leader in Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: MASTER ANY CONVERSATION OR DISCUSSION IN WHICH YOU TAKE PART. </p><p> The best way to attain leadership in talk is to make everything that you say worthy of being heard. </p><p> I know a keen business man who masters any conversation in which he takes part — but he never appears to be doing so. He speaks directly to the point, with clear common sense. He tells a story that illustrates a point in question. He takes up a remark, and amplifies and illustrates it. He gives a new turn of thought to the -conversation. You feel that there is a world of personal power back of him. As a result, he is head of a great business enterprise. </p><p> A talkative person is not usually a leader. Leadership lies with the one who gives his judgment opportunity to -act before he speaks. </p><p> People are quick to discover sound points of view. It is well not to be too ready to enter into talk. </p><p> Listen, gather evidence, reflect upon it, and speak with weight rather than with glibness. </p><p> Take the lead in introducing topics of discussion. </p><p> If you know with whom you are likely to talk, and under what circumstances, prepare yourself by thinking, ahead of time, of topics that are likely to prove of interest. </p><p> Read newspapers, periodicals, and books of the day, so that you will be able to speak from a full mind. One who has a fund of information at command will be able to make any discussion interesting. </p><p> Take a commanding position in any talk by proposing new lines of thought, or new subdivisions of old lines. </p><p> Avoid letting those with whom you speak give most of the suggestions. </p><p> Do not allow a conversation to close until you have determined that you wish it to close. When you have presented all the lines of thought that you think advisable, bring the talk to a close yourself, with **the last word." </p><p> If you can do all this without bumptiousness or conceit, and with proper regard for the opinions of others, you will soon find yourself talking easily, and masterfully, with those of whom you may once have stood in awe. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. In your next group conversation notice which person takes the lead. What are his methods? What is the effect? </p><p> 2. Try the experiment of mastering a group conversation. What difficulties do you find? How may you overcome the difficulties? </p><p> 3. When you are next called upon for suggestions make an endeavor to say the last word, and notice the difficulties, their remedies, and the result. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 45. How to Make a Point of Contact in Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: IN SPEAKING TO ONE PERSON, TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE, OR TO A LARGE AUDIENCE, FIRST ESTABLISH A DEFINITE POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN YOUR HEARERS AND YOURSELF. </p><p> A point of contact is a common ground of interest on which you meet. </p><p> Make a point of contact by talking about things in which you and your hearers are alike interested. </p><p> There is always some definite point of contact that can be established, even with strangers, or with an audience that is cold, or even openly antagonistic. </p><p> Once I found myself left in a room face to face with Theodore Roosevelt. How could I possibly say something that would be personal and friendly, rather than formal? But there is always a close point of contact between any two people. I turned the conversation to one ^f Mr. Roosevelt's personal friends whom I also knew — President Butler of Columbia University. Mr. Roosevelt at once brightened, and we had a friendly, familiar talk on a subject in which we were both interested. </p><p> Recently, in talking on different occasions with three men in authority, all strangers to me, I found, — within a few minutes in every case, — that one had been born within a block of my own birthplace; that another had two sons in my own college fraternity; and that the third Jiad visited a little country town where I spent my boyhood. In every case I was at once placed upon a more familiar footing, and gained greater opportunity to conduct my interview successfully. </p><p> Much of the so-called mastery of speech, and power of / oratory, is nothing more nor less than the clever establishing of a point of contact. </p><p> The common ground between friends of long standing is what makes the talks of friendship so delightful and appealing. A mere suggestion made by a friend is more convincingly powerful than the most carefully thought out words of a stranger. </p><p> When you speak with anyone whom you particularly wish to interest, find a point of contact from some of the following: </p><p> 1. The memory of pleasant days spent together. </p><p> 2. Acquaintanceships in common. </p><p> 3. Associations in school. </p><p> 4. Associations in business. </p><p> 5. The love of similar objects. </p><p> 6. Similar experiences. </p><p> 7. Life in similar places. </p><p> 8. Generally interesting recent events. </p><p> 9. Recent books. </p><p> 10. Recreations. </p><p> In public speaking, as well as in social and business life, it is as necessary, as vital, to have points of contact. </p><p> If you are to speak to any audience, first, in a few quick sentences, show that audience that you and they are on some basis of common interest in life. You are, as it were, one of them in some one way. </p><p> Listen to some popular speaker and notice how cleverly he establishes the common ground. From that moment he ceases to be a stranger to his audience and becomes, in part, a friend and associate. </p><p> Listen to the talk of some person who is popular among men and notice how he habitually begins any talk by assuming, or by immediately forming, a common Ijond of interest. Such a person adds to his popularity by meeting people on common ground. He also adds to his power over men. .He will be remembered and will be liked. </p><p> Follow his example and, by habit, form points of contact on every occasion. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Think of three different people whom you will talk with soon. What points of contact will you establish with every one? </p><p> 2. You are to give a demonstration of your work. What point of contact can you establish with an ordinary audience? </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 46. How to Take Advantage of the Light While Speaking </p><p> KEY WORDS: PLACE YOURSELF SO THAT THE LIGHT WILL BE ON THE FACE OF THE ONE TO WHOM YOU SPEAK. </p><p> Guide and control any conversation into which you enter. </p><p> You will be best able to do this if you can at all times read the mind of the person to whom you speak. </p><p> Let the light fall upon his face, and observe the effect of your words. See in his face a reflection of his inner thoughts. </p><p> If you have an office and are accustomed to interview people, place your desk in such a way that all who a</p><p> roach you will have the light in their faces. Then, from your point of vantage, study countenances while you hold interviews. </p><p> Look around you now and see what changes will be necessary in your office to give you the advantage of the light. </p><p> When I took the manuscript of this work to Mr. Karl V. S. Rowland, President of the Independent Corporation, he motioned me to a chair. There was no other place in the room where I could sit. The light from three big windows was full in my face. Mr. Howland sat at his desk, with the light behind him. He had arranged his room purposely and strategically for the purpose of talking well There was no way to avoid the position he had arranged, unless I remained standing. </p><p> If you have not been in the habit of thus using the light you will be astonished at the power over conversation that this little device will give you. </p><p> When you visit an office, perhaps as applicant for a favor, do all in your power to stand or sit in such a way that you will gain the advantage of the light. If you do this you are far more likely to speak easily and convincingly, and to gain your point. </p><p> Consider the last interview you had with some man who was in some way your superior. How could you have gained the advantage of light? </p><p> It is just as important in social and business affairs as it is in military campaigns to gain a position of advantage. </p><p> Even in a friendly talk, where you and your friend meet as perfect equals, follow the rule of gaining the light, for it will help you to talk to advantage. </p><p> In public speaking you will find it far easier to speak in the light than in the dark, as when exhibiting stereopticon pictures. You will speak to best advantage if the hall is so well lighted that you can study the faces of your hearers.  </p><p> In all cases seek the advantage of the light and mould your speech accordingly. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Observe the eyes of some public speaker who has real power over his hearers. How does he take advantage of the light? </p><p> 2. Repeat to yourself the principles of speech that have been given thus far concerning (a) The eyes, (b) The expression, (c) Leadership, (d) Point of contact, and (e) The light. </p><p> 8. Consider how you can apply the principles to the following cases: (a) You appeal to a man for a position in his employ, (b) A man appeals to you for a position that you have advertised as open. </p><p> 
LESSON 47. How to Master Unforeseen Circumstances in Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: MASTER CIRCUMSTANCES BY MAINTAINING COMPOSURE AT ALL TIMES. </p><p> In talk of every sort you are certain to meet situations that you could not have foreseen. </p><p> There are two possible courses of action: </p><p> 1. You may be so overwhelmed by the new and altogether unexpected situation that you will be confused and put to loss. </p><p> 2. You will meet the situation as though you had fully expected it to arise. </p><p> The latter is, of course, the method you should follow. </p><p> The greatest mastery of circumstances in public speech was shown by Henry Ward Beecher in his address at Liverpool, October 16, 1863. Mr. Beecher had been sent to England to encourage sentiment in favor of the Union. The fate of the United States depended upon his success. At Liverpool he faced an almost entirely hostile audience. In spite of interruptions of all sorts of a kind that would have driven most speakers from the platform, he made an address that was all powerful. He met the situation by a</p><p> ealing to two things that every Englishman loves —courage and fair play. "One thing," said he, "is very certain, if you do permit me to speak here tonight you will hear "^ very plain talking." Hooting, hisses, * and cries interrupted him throughout the speech, but he kept his temper, held the platform, and put his thoughts hefore the audience. </p><p> Expect the unexpected, and meet conditions gladly. </p><p> It may be that the very unexpectedness of the conditions will be the stimulus you need in order to succeed. </p><p> . Edwin Booth, the great actor, when on a tour with his company, once failed to receive his baggage containing the necessary costumes. Rather than abandon an important engagement, Mr. Booth and his company, wearing ordinary traveling clothes, presented one of Shakespeare's plays. Knowing that they had no appropriate costumes on which to rely, the company acted the parts with such zest that they made the performance an unequalled success. They met an unexpected situation, mastered it, and increased their reputation. </p><p> A diplomatic American tried to flee from a foreign city in the midst of riots. His coachman drove into a street filled with rioters. ' They surrounded the carriage and entered into angry words with the coachman. There was grave danger. The American met the situation by stepping from the carriage, tipping his hat to the leaders of the mob, and saying: "Gentlemen, I don't like to drive on crowded streets. I think I'll go back." The crowd laughed and let him go. </p><p> In business life there are innumerable times when interruptions occur in the midst of most important talks, times when important matters seem to go contrary in every way, times when it is well nigh impossible to keep composure. Those occasions are opportunities for the man of real ability in speech. </p><p> Do not give way to anger. </p><p> Do not lose all sense of balance and of proportion. </p><p> Do not even feel that things are going wrong. </p><p> Continue to speak as though you had expected the situation. </p><p> Make the interrupted talk, the sudden commotion, the absolutely unexpected circumstance, the opportunity for which you have been waiting. Master any and every situation. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. You have long waited for a time when you could confer with a certain influential man on a matter of great importance to you. You have just a</p><p> roached the subject, when one of his friends joins him and entirely, turns the conversation. How will you master the situation? </p><p> 2. A man accuses you unfairly, becomes more and more angry, and says many insulting things. How should you master the situation? </p><p> 3. Recall some case of a public speaker who met with most unexpected interruptions while speaking. How did he meet the situation? Was he successful? </p><p> 4. You are giving an illustrated lecture in the midst of which the lantern operator first misplaces many of your slides, and finally drops and breaks several. How can you speak in order to master the situation? </p><p>  </p><p> LESSON 48. How to Maintain Good Nature in Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: BE GOOD NATURED. </p><p> One of the greatest means of gaining power in speech is to continue good natured in spite of almost every temptation to give way to bad nature of some sort. </p><p> There are times and occasions when anger may be so justified that one should be blamed if he did not become angry. These times are so rare that, as a rule, you should keep your speech free from every ill natured, or angry word. </p><p> No one really respects a man who allows his speech to become habitually unbalanced by temper or even by ill nature. </p><p> It is easy to growl and grumble and complain, to speak disparaging words, and to burst into fits of anger at all sorts of trifles. </p><p> The effect is bad in two directions. In the first place complaint, bitterness, disparagement and anger convey impressions of weakness rather than of strength. </p><p> People who hear such speech, even when not directed at them, immediately, consciously or unconsciously rate the speaker lower than before. </p><p> In the second place, complaining or angry words react on the speaker, making him less able to make correct </p><p> judgments, to master circumstances, and maintain composure when he would really like to do so. </p><p> Most important of all, good nature is a powerful element in speech. </p><p> The most dangerous fighter is always the one who keeps himself unruffled, and balanced in mind. To be an effective business talker follow these rules: </p><p> 1. Hold your complaint and your anger in check. </p><p> 2. Maintain a spirit of such good nature that it will conquer anything. </p><p> A subordinate took offense at the methods of his^ superior. One day when the superior had called his attention to some fault, he burst into violent anger, and abusive speech. He called his superior "every name in the calendar," voicing the vexation of months. The superior proved his right to a superior position. He kept good natured under the situation, recognized the value of the subordinate's position, and made no abusive or complaining retort. The subordinate might have been discharged, important work might have been disturbed, and the two men might have become enemies. Today they are firm friends. </p><p> - Instead of complaint, give constructive advice. </p><p> Instead of anger keep calm and cool, and make your speech effective through its reflection of your own good nature. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. You walk with a friend who speaks contemptuously of many people whom you know. How may it work to your advantage if you keep yourself from any ill-natured remarks? </p><p> 2. You find, in your daily life, that many things go wrong, and that you have many real troubles. Most people grumble about, such conditions. How can you make your daily conversations with friends a real help? </p><p> 3. Think of some person who habitually gives way to sudden anger. In what ways is that person's anger a hindrance to success? </p><p> 4. When you are next tempted to angry speech control your words and inhibit anger. Notice if you gain or lose by such speech. </p><p> 5. Think of some one who habitually controls his speech. How much has his self -controlled speech added to his. success in life? </p><p> </p><p> 
LESSON 49. How to Read the Minds of Those to Whom You Speak </p><p> KEY WORDS: PUT YOURSELF IN HIS PLACE </p><p> If a person could have such wisdom that he could see fully into the minds of other people he would almost never be at a loss for effective speech. </p><p> He would know the situation fully and would therefore be prepared to meet it. </p><p> No one can ever hope to have such wisdom, but he can at least approach it. </p><p> When a parent talks to a child he very largely understands what is passing in the child's mind. This gives the parent an advantage that commands the full respect of the child. </p><p> In business life approach the ability that a parent has in dealing with a child. Know what is passing in the minds of those with whom you talk. </p><p> Gain that knowledge by putting yourself in the position of those with whom you talk. </p><p> All people, under exactly similar conditions, act somewhat alike. You may easily assume a situation and the attitude toward the situation. </p><p> Do not assume that you are in the other person's place. Assume that you actually are the other person. </p><p> It is said that George M. Cohan writes his plays for an imaginary newsboy named "Bill," who sits in the 'top gallery." As he writes, he puts himself in "Bill's" place, and looks at the play. If the imaginary "Bill" doesn't like the scene, Mr. Cohan rewrites it. "I wonder if Bill will like that," he says, and by thus putting himself in the audience, makes his plays successes. </p><p> We are all of us so naturally gifted with understanding of human nature that we can easily, in mind, act the part of another. </p><p> You have something to sell. Your prospective customer is a man very different from yourself in mind and in circumstances. Put yourself in his place. Imagine that you are he, with all his likes and dislikes. </p><p> Think what kind of speech would best induce you to purchase. Then make that kind of speech. </p><p> On the contrary, think what kind of speech would be least successful with you. Avoid that kind of speech. </p><p> Forget yourself, and try to understand the influences that affect the person to whom you talk— the difficulties, the anxieties. </p><p> You will find such understanding will guide your speech to success. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. You wish to obtain a charitable subscription from a busy man who is subject to constant interruptions. What kind of speech will be most effective? </p><p> 2. A workman in your employ makes frequent costly errors. You do not wish to discharge him. What words ivill help him most? </p><p> 3. You are chairman of a committee to ask for an increase of wages? How will you best a</p><p> roach your employer? </p><p> 
LESSON 50. How to Make Use of Compliment </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE COMPLIMENT WHEN IT IS DESERVED. </p><p> There is an old proverb that says: "You can catch more flies with sugar than with vinegar." </p><p> The meaning is clear. The sugared word is attractive to men and women; the harsh word is disagreeable. </p><p> A married man found his wife's temper so unruly that he could endure it no longer. He asked his lawyer to draw up papers of separation. </p><p> "Why not change her temper?" said the lawyer. </p><p> "It can't be done," was the reply. </p><p> "Compliment her, compliment her," advised the shrewd old lawyer. "She surely does or says something that you like. Tell the truth, but compliment her."</p><p> It was hard work at first, but, to his surprise, the man found more and more to compliment, and the wife less and less about which to be angry. </p><p> Carried to a reasonable and moderate degree compliment is peculiarly effective. </p><p> When extravagant, ill-timed, or hypocritical, nothing could be worse. People naturally despise too much compliment. They realize that it is forced, or aimed at a purpose, it then ceases to be compliment at all and becomes an insult. </p><p> Everyone has a. close knowledge of his limitations* He knows when compliment becomes hypocritical flattery, and he distrusts the person who uses it. </p><p> Make quick, natural, well-timed and genuine compliment a part of your daily speech. </p><p> Give compliment by means of pleasant facial expressions. </p><p> Give compliment by helpful acts. Give compliment in a few words. </p><p> AU people are child-like in their love of praise. They know when they have done well, and they like to have their good work recognized. </p><p> The greatest man is pleased by the genuine compliment of the humblest. </p><p> In your daily speech — social, business, or public — be quick to recognize excellence and give it its due reward of praise. </p><p> Use frequently such words as "That's right," 'Tour judgment is good," "I like your plans," "I can always rely on you," "This is an excellent piece of work," and a thousand other quick words of appreciation or compliment. </p><p> Such words add grace to speech, and, at the same time, give command over men. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. How did Napoleon Bonaparte use compliment as a means of increasing his power over men? </p><p> 2. What man of your acquaintance has gained power by use of honest compliment? What is his method? </p><p> 3. What is the effect of genuine compliment upon you? Do you think that it affects others likewise? </p><p> 4. How could a spirit of recognition of excellence affect the work in which you are now engaged? </p><p> 5. Why do the addresses and messages of commanding military officers contain so much compliment? </p><p> 6. In your next important talk introduce the spirit of honest compliment and note the result. </p><p> 
LESSON 51. How to Be a Good Listener </p><p> KEY WORDS: BE A GOOD LISTENER IN ORDER TO GAIN THE OTHER PERSON'S POINT OF VIEW. </p><p> Curiously enough, one of the best means of talking is not to talk. </p><p> The person who monopolizes all the time and hardly allows the other person to say a word is a bad talker. </p><p> Good talking always presupposes two parts, </p><p> 1. A speaker. </p><p> 2. A listener. </p><p> It also presupposes a constant alternation of speaking and listening. </p><p> If you speak all, or most, of the time, you thereby express yourself, but under a disadvantage. You will not have heard the responses that should have been given, and you will not be fully informed of .the state of mind of the other person. You may speak to your own disadvantage. </p><p> In the "Sherlock Holmes" stories Conan Doyle very acutely makes the famous detective a good listener. </p><p> Watson, who has less logical ability, is always interrupting, or ready for action before all the facts have been presented. Sherlock Holmes asks quick questions, listens, and gives his visitors full sway. </p><p> Many dramatic moments in plays have been built on this sort of speech. </p><p> 1. In every social or business talk, give your friend or associate an opportunity for self-expression. </p><p> 2. In general, practise the habit of listening, which is a form of compliment that is always appreciated. </p><p> 3. At times make your speech effective by restricting it to almost no speech at all. </p><p> 4. On such occasions give your associate full play, as a good fisherman gives play to a fish but at no moment looses him from the hook. Let him express himself freely and fully while you listen. </p><p> Such a method will be as effective for you as it is for the fisherman. </p><p> A popular story is founded on the conception that "Everybody's Lonesome." Another might be founded on the idea that "Everybody likes to be heard." </p><p> 5. Practise the art of being a sympathetic listener. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. You wish to sell a life insurance policy to a man. with whom you are not well acquainted. How will it aid you to sell the policy if you give him o</p><p> ortunity to speak fully and often? </p><p> 2. You have an important business matter to lay before an influential man, and you have little time at your disposal. You are tempted to do all the talking in order to complete the matter in the limited time. Why will it be to your advantage to give him full time for speech? </p><p> 8. A friend begins to reminisce. How will it affect your relations with him if you speak very little? </p><p> 
LESSON 52. How to Gain the Power of Silence </p><p> KEY WORDS: CULTIVATE THE POWER OF siLENCE. </p><p> Some of the world's most powerful men have been noted for silence. </p><p> They have communed with their own souls and have lived, as it were, in a great silence. And yet they have done great things, and have said great things. </p><p> As a result, the world has come to think that a silent man is a man of power. </p><p> You need not go back to the career of William the Silent, the great Dutch patriot, one of the strongest and most powerful men who ever lived, or even to the lives of General Grant and General Lee, both of whom were men of silence. </p><p> Look around you at men of today with whom you associate. You see many who chatter idly and frivolously, saying nothing with much seriousness, and often, with thoughtless words, saying something harmful. </p><p> It was such a person whom Shakespeare ridiculed when, in "The Merchant of Venice," he said "Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice." </p><p> No one admires such a person. Such a one is amusing but not substantial. </p><p> On the other hand, you see a few of your associates who are **men of silence." Like Colonel House, they say little but they think much. Their opinions are worth knowing. When they do speak they are likely to speak wisely. • </p><p> In college I knew a thin, red-haired youth who maintained an almost unbroken silence during four years. When called upon he spoke well and to the point, but otherwise was silent. He became a lawyer — ^and was silent. They made him mayor of Northampton, Mass. He still was remarkably silent. They sent him to the Massachusetts Legislature. Silent on all ordinary times, he spoke wonderfully well when necessary. They sent him to the State Senate. He became President of the Senate, then Lieutenant Governor, and finally Governor, of Massachusetts, and now he is mentioned for the Presidency. Calvin Coolidge is a silent man — yes, but one of his short orations on the war has been sent broadcast through the land. By never uttering a foolish, trivial word he saves himself from censure. In the silence he gathers strength, so that when he does speak all are glad to hear. </p><p> You n^ay not make silent people your boon companions for gay larks and excursions, but you go to them for advice in your difficulties. </p><p> Their power over men comes largely from concentration. </p><p> 1. Do not waste energy in idle, flippant speech. </p><p> 2. Do not form habits of speaking thoughtlessly. </p><p> 3. Make silence lead to good judgment. </p><p> 4. Resolutely practise the art of silence so that you may speak wisely when you do speak. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Think of some person for whose judgment you have very great respect. Is he talkative or silent? </p><p> 2. Think of some person who is notably talkative. Have you found his judgment reliable? </p><p> 3. Make a list of five great historic characters. Find from their biographies if they were talkative or silent. </p><p> 4. What powers must be associated with "silence" if ''silence" is to be worth while? </p><p> 6. How may you best cultivate the power of silence? </p><p> 
LESSON 53. How to Use the Power of Brevity </p><p> KEY WORDS: SPEAK BRIEFLY AND TO THE POINT. </p><p> Novelists and play writers have made much fun with characters who speak with "total recall," that is, with characters who talk on forever, giving all related details, and taking a long time to arrive at a point. </p><p> You meet such people, not only in the pages of Dickens and of George Eliot, but in life. </p><p> Most frequently those who are most roundabout in speech, and least likely to go directly to the point, are illiterate and ignorant people. </p><p> Lawyers who have questioned such people on the witness stand find it hard to keep testimony within proper limits. Such people find it almost impossible to speak directly to the point. </p><p> The Parables in the New Testament are remarkable examples of brevity. The Great Teacher had certain truths that He wished to teach, and He expressed those truths in terse, original stories that are full of point and emphasis. He seems, at all times, to have spoken briefly. </p><p> Trained, educated people, and especially those who have the management of large affairs, habitually speak briefly and to the point. </p><p> They have no time and no inclination for petty details and for roundabout expressions. One who would be a good talker must follow the example of the man of large affairs. </p><p> 1. Learn to speak briefly and directly. </p><p> Modern life is so complex, so full of demands for time, that men have little patience with one who rambles on in an endless way. </p><p> 2. Avoid prolixity, talking at length. </p><p> 3. Take time to establish your point of contact, and to develop your subject, but limit your speech as much as possible. </p><p> 4. Avoid all distinctly non-essential, or subordinate details. </p><p> 5. In particular, avoid being turned away from the subject in hand to some other slightly related subject. </p><p> 6. Be insistent in following your line of thought clearly and quickly to a definite point. Then, and not till then, turn aside, if you wish, to some other topic. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Recall some example of 'total recall" on the witness stand, or in literature. How did it impress you toward the person concerned? </p><p> 2. You are talking with a business man on a most important matter. He has the habit of turning the subject without knowing that he is doing it. How should you talk? </p><p> 3. You find that you are accustomed to interrupt your friends with irreflevant remarks. What is the effect? </p><p> 4. You are a lawyer examining a witness who, purposely or unconsciously, speaks indirectly and at length. What should you do? </p><p> 5. Consider your own habits of speech with regard to brevity and point. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 54: How to Arouse Interest in What You Say </p><p> KEY WORDS: AROUSE INTEREST BY POINT OF CONTACT AND BY AVOIDING THE COMMONPLACE. PROSINESS IS FATAL TO TALK OF EVERY KIND. </p><p> 1. Establish a bond of interest of some kind in every talk. </p><p> That bond is found through a clear understanding of the circumstances. There are times when what would add to interest on one occasion would interfere with interest on another. </p><p> 2. Adapt yourself to circumstances. </p><p> It is a mistake to think that there is any one way of creating interest. There are as many ways of creating interest as there are occasions for speaking. </p><p> 3. Establish a good point of contact and you are certain to create interest. </p><p> The relationship between mother and child is so close that the mother is keenly interested in anything whatever that the child says or does. The child's acts and words may be of the most trivial sort, utterly uninteresting to any but the mother. The point of contact, the warm relationship, creates interest. </p><p> In business talking you should create interest by establishing as close a point of contact as possible. </p><p> 4. Create interest by arousing curiosity. </p><p> All people have curiosity in a high degree. That is why crowds collect so quickly when anything unusual occurs. A public speaker, by exhibiting objects, or by promising to do or say certain. things, arouses curiosity, and therefore arouses interest. </p><p> Some years ago I heard a street fakir speak in a country village. He said: "'Gentlemen, I am a notorious swindler. I have come here to swindle you. If you have any money in your pockets, go home. Here is what I did in other places." And he read newspaper accounts proclaiming him a dangerous swindler. His words interested everyone. The crowd increased. His power of talking maintained interest, and he actually swindled the entire crowd just as he had said he would do. He had aroused interest because he had appealed to curiosity. </p><p> 5. In conversation arouse curiosity. Lead to your point by degrees; make your speech take the effect of climax. </p><p> 6. Do or say that which is unusual, new, or in any way out of the ordinary. </p><p> 7. Avoid the commonplace. </p><p> 8. Use humor freely as a means of creating interest </p><p> 9. Use exaggeration in a whimsical manner, 10« Use distinctive or unusual gesture. </p><p> 11. Give a few specific details. </p><p> 12. Exhibit specimens, samples, pictures, maps, or any object. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Think of some particular person with whom you intend to talk. What point of contact will interest him in what you have to say? </p><p> 2. You are to speak to a small audience. How can you employ curiosity as a means of creating. interest? </p><p> 8. You are a traveling salesman. What objective illustrations will awaken interest in your goods? </p><p> 4. What reasons prompt the employment of demonstrations? How may you follow similar methods in your business talks? </p><p> 5. Think of the most interesting speaker you have heard. How did he gain interest? </p><p> 6. You have a friend who has the power to interest people in all that he says. What are his methods? </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 55. How to Speak Humorously </p><p> KEY WORDS: MAKE FREE USE OF ALL HUMOR EXCEPT THAT WHICH IS VULGAR OR SATIRICAL. </p><p> Few gifts add more delight to conversation, and to public speaking in general, than the ability to use wit and humor. </p><p> Some one has said that if a man has the gift of humor and employs it well, he can easily make a fortune. The example of Mark Twain is notable. </p><p> I know a man who has a remarkable gift of humor. In whatever company he finds himself he is delightfully spontaneous. Story after story comes to his lips, and his fund of anecdotes seems unlimited. He tells of ordinary events in a way to provoke laughter. I have known him many years, but I have never heard him vulgar or profane, nor have I heard him turn the laugh on others. It is needless to say that he is popular, and that he has advanced from a small salary to a large salary, and an important position in life. </p><p> It is certain that a man who makes proper use of hum^r will attract friends, </p><p> A public speaker who uses humor will attract large audiences. </p><p> Even the most serious talks may be enlivened by humor. Think of Henry Ward Beecher in Plymouth Church, of Russell H, Conway, the famous lecturer, and of Billy Sunday,, the Evangelist. These men all spoke on most serious topics, but they used humor for interest and for emphasis. </p><p> Humor has a great value in all talks as a means of relief. </p><p> People who are suffering keenly from physical injury, or who are oppressed with grief or anxiety, frequently fall into expressions of humor, merely to gain momentary relief. </p><p> In this way humor was one of the elements of strength in Abraham Lincoln in the. darkest days of the Civil War. </p><p> 1. Form the habit of speaking with a smile. </p><p> 2. Form the habit of laughter. </p><p> 3. Cultivate the ability of telling a story well. </p><p> 4. Note down ten good humorous anecdotes. </p><p> 5. Fix them in memory by the use of key words, and be ready to use them at a moment's notice. </p><p> 6. Change your list of anecdotes frequently. You will soon gain the reputation of being a man who can tell a good story welL </p><p> 7. Always avoid the coarse, vulgar or profane story, which really pleases no one. </p><p> 8. Avoid humor that satirizes, ridicules, or brings annoyance to another. </p><p> 9. Base humor on your own experiences. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. What public speaker do you most like to hear? How does he make use of humor? </p><p> 2. What persons of your acquaintance do you consider the most brilliant talkers? How do they employ humor? </p><p> 3. Do you know some person who habitually tells coarse, vulgar, or profane -stories? What is your real opinion of the effect of these stories on tiiose who hear them? </p><p> 4. Why did Shakespeare have humorous scenes in some of his greatest tragedies? </p><p> 6. How many humorous anecdotes can you relate now? Prepare a list of ten such anecdotes and use them frequently. Change the list often. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 56. How to Be Epigrammatic in Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: MAKE FREE USE OF EPIGRAMS. </p><p> Some of the most noted talkers in the world have added greatly to their reputations by the use of epigrams, proverbs, and hon mots of all sorts. </p><p> An epigram is a short, pithy saying that is easily remembered. </p><p> Such an expression is the famous line, "To err is human; to forgive, divine." Such also is President Wilson's powerful saying, "We must make the world safe for democracy." </p><p> For some time The Independent has printed a column of "Remarkable Remarks," a series of epigrammatic sayings by people of the day. </p><p> 1. Read that column week by week. </p><p> 2. Quote from it in your daily speech. </p><p> One of the most influential epigrams, "Carry the Message to Garcia," was created by Elbert Hubbard. The New York Central Railroad printed hundreds of thousands of copies of the story that emphasizes the epigram, "Carry the Message," that is. Do the thing you are told to do, and do it well. Man after man on that great railroad system said to his fellows: "Carry the Message," and the epigram, striking home every time, added to railroad efficiency. </p><p> People like all kinds of epigrammatic sayings because such expressions are packed with wisdom. They contain much in little. </p><p> It is exceedingly difficult to make new epigrams, but it is an easy matter to collect and memorize a large number of such sayings that have come down to us from the past or that arise in the present. </p><p> 3. Notice such sayings as they appear in current literature. </p><p> 4. Write them in note books. </p><p> 5. Use them when the occasion arises. </p><p> 6. Whenever you use epigrams be careful to use such ones as will be understood immediately without explanation. </p><p> Benjamin Franklin owed much of his fame as a speaker and a writer to the use of epigrammatic material. When the colonists were discussing the danger of resisting by force, and some one, seeing the need of united action, said: "We must hang together," Franklin at once replied with the epigrammatic repartee: "Yes, if we don't hang together we shall all hang separately." </p><p> Franklin, in the course of his long life, collected hundreds of old maxims and proverbs, the wise sayings of the ages. </p><p> 7. Follow Franklin's example. Collect epigrams. </p><p> Epigrams and proverbs are expressions of established wisdom. </p><p> 8. Refer to epigrams as to recognized authority. </p><p> 9. Employ such references in your speech, and you will soon gain a reputation of wisdom, an air of authority, that will add power to your speech. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Make a list of fifteen proverbs that you will be able to use in business talking. </p><p> 2. Make a list of ten good epigrams that will help you in general speech. </p><p> 3. When you hear some popular speaker, notice if he uses epigrams. If he does, note down two or three of his best sayings. </p><p> 4. Read some important speech of the day. Underline the epigrammatic sayings. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 57. How to Use Slogans in Speech </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE PERSONAL SLOGANS IN DAILY SPEECH. </p><p> In the middle ages the knights inscribed upon their shields mottoes such as the famous "Esperance" — "Hope" — of the house of Percy. Such mottoes, or battle cries, did much to increase the reputations of the ones who employed them. At the same time, they were influences toward courage and perseverance. </p><p> Our own "In God We Trust" and "E Pluribus Unum" are of similar nature. </p><p> The business world has found it advantageous to use similar "battle cries" or slogans. </p><p> The most noted just now is the familiar "Safety First," a slogan that has done much. in recent years to save life and limb. </p><p> The United States, in selling Liberty Bonds, and in prosecuting the war, found it advantageous to publish, hundreds of brilliant slogans, the best of all, perhaps, being the famous "Do Your Bit." </p><p> "Women and Children First" is a slogan of the seals that illustrates remarkably well the value of such expressions. It is, first, a quick, highly condensed statement of the chivalry that has marked our sailors. It is. Secondly, an appealing message strongly encouraging the maintenance of that chivalry. </p><p> The slogan takes such. quick hold on thought, and is so effective in every way, that it is of especial value in business. </p><p> The effect is twofold— </p><p> (a) On the one who uses it. </p><p> (b) On those who hear it. </p><p> 1. Use some personal slogan to suit your individual needs. </p><p> I know a man who has for his personal slogan the words, "I do everyrthing I set out to do." The result has been a strengthening of determination that has led him to turn many failures into successes. In some instances he has been thwarted for years, but he succeeds ultimately in nearly everything he undertakes. </p><p> One of the most respected men I ever knew had for his slogan, "I believe in being careful" As a result, from being quite poor he became a master of finance, and a man to whom others went for good judgment. </p><p> 2. Use some of the following personal slogans: "I never act hastily."  "I keep every promise that I make."  "I am always on time." "I act on principle." "You can rely upon me." "I try to be systematic." </p><p> 3. Find some particular slogan that you can use to peculiar advantage. </p><p> 4. Use it frequently in your business talks. </p><p> 5. Live up to it to the very letter. </p><p> You will find that this simple expedient of talk will at once make you stronger and more successful. </p><p> 
PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Make a list of advertising slogans. What is the advantage of every one? </p><p> 2. Notice the use of personal slogans in business life. Make a list of the most effective that you hear from day to day. </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 58. How to Gain Power in Speech by Questioning </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE QUESTIONS AS A MEANS OF POWER OF SPEECH. </p><p> The hero of Arnold Bennett's novel, "Denry the Audacious," attains success in a curious way. Not having advantages of wealth or of education, he found a way to riches and fame through the medium of speech. He always asked the question: "Do you?" Little by little he gained a reputation for wisdom and ability, without having any very large share of either. </p><p> The fantastic story teaches a good lesson. Few people like to assume the burden of statement. It is unwise to contradict what another has said. It is easy to ask questions. The hero of the story did not notice contradiction, nor did he answer questions. He put the full burden upon the ones with whom he talked. His constant questions were: </p><p> "Do you think so?" </p><p> "What do you think?" </p><p> "Is that your opinion?" </p><p> Few people can resist it. It has the advantage of being entirely non-committal as far as you are concerned and it draws the full thought of the one with whom you speak. </p><p> One of my friends, consciously or unconsciously, employs this method. Again and again I have heard his direct questions: "Do you?", "Do you think so?", and they always search out logical weaknesses, and call for thought. </p><p> 1. Never contradict. </p><p> 2. Never argue. </p><p> 3. Give your companion the opportunity to assume the full burden. </p><p> In almost every case you will win your point. </p><p> There are times when it would be impolite or offensive if you immediately expressed your opinion. </p><p> 4. Be wholly non-committal, and give full sway to the one who speaks. Put him, as it were, in your power. </p><p> There are times when your associates speak hastily or thoughtlessly. You do not wish to contradict them openly. </p><p> 5. Say quietly: "Do you think so?" and you give opportunity for thought and revision. </p><p> This method is one of the most successful methods of speech when you wish, </p><p> (a) To gain a temporary advantage: </p><p> (b) To show the weakness of an argument. </p><p> (c) To talk with an angry or quarrelsome person. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. You have certain political views. A friend, who has opposite views, questions you and shows evidence of beginning a quarrel. How will you speak in order to avoid trouble? </p><p> 2. You are speaking with an old lady whose views are radically different from your own. You do not wish to disturb her peace of mind. How will you talk with her? </p><p> 3. You wish to show a friend where he is wrong, but you do not wish to offend him. How will you talk with him? </p><p> </p><p> LESSON 59. How to Speak Inductively </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE INDUCTIVE SPEECH WHEN YOUR HEARERS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS. </p><p> In the beginning, in true induction, we have little or no idea of the principle at which we shall arrive, nor do we even know that we are moving towards a principle. </p><p> A merchant, more or less by accident arranges his goods in a certain way. An increased sale follows, but he is not certain to what the sale is due. When an increased sale has several times followed a similar arrangement, he comes to the conclusion that that arrangement has enlarged the sales. </p><p> Induction is a development from many details to a conclusion. It is, as it were, the result of experiment. </p><p> The one who follows an inductive course of thought, makes his own experiments, makes his own observations, and comes to his own conclusions. He accepts nothing on hearsay. Everything is the result of his own observation and thought. He therefore comes to his conclusions slowly, but he will hold those conclusions firmly. </p><p> The president of a great company supplied his salesmen with complete outfits showing the raw materials from which his goods were made, and the steps in the •manufacture. He told the men to show these one by one to prospective purchasers, and to explain that the material was the best in the market, and that the various steps in manufacture were well taken. The result showed that he was justified. The customers put the facts together, acknowledged that the goods were the best, and made the purchases. </p><p> 1. In sales talks, in political discussions, and in argument of every kind, where your hearers are not likely to accept your own conclusions, </p><p> Call their attention to some fact that they will admit. </p><p> Then to a second related fact. </p><p> Then to a third. </p><p> And so on, every fact being one that will lead your hearers to put two and two together, and to come, of their own accords, to the conclusion that you wish. </p><p> 2. Do not state that conclusion first. </p><p> 3. Your hearers must observe blindly, until the conclusion flashes upon them. Then it is irresistible — ^for it is their own thinking that has brought them to your point of view. </p><p> 4. Use this form of speaking, or questioning, and you will win many a victory in speech. </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Think of some specific article that you might sell. Prepare a series of inductive steps that will lead a prospective customer to make a purchase. </p><p> 2. Think of some scientific instrument or appliance that you wish to explain. Frame a series of inductive questions that will lead your hearer to dii^over the principle involved </p><p> 3. You are engaged in a political discussion. Present a series of facts that will lead your hearers to make an induction that you yourself have already made. </p><p> </p><p> 
LESSON 60. How to Speak Deductively </p><p> KEY WORDS: USE DEDUCTIVE SPEECH IN ALL ORDINARY SALES TALKS OR ARGUMENTS. </p><p> Deduction is a process of reasoning by which one proceeds from a known principle, or conclusion, to the recognition that a certain fact falls under that principle,, or conclusion. </p><p> Most of the famous detective stories are based on deduction. The detective knows, for example, that certain calluses are produced by certain types of work. He sees a man whose hands have calluses of the type concerned. He therefore concludes, reasonably, that the stranger is employed in the particular type of work. </p><p> There are three steps in his reasoning. </p><p> 1. Major Premise: All workers in potteries have certain calluses on the hands. </p><p> 2. Minor Premise: This stranger has those particular calluses. </p><p> 3. Conclusion: This stranger works in a pottery. </p><p> If the major premise is true, and if the minor premise is true, and is properly related to the major premise, the conclusion is irresistible. In Edgar Allan Poe's story,. "The Purloined Letter," a brilliant investigator is given the task of recovering a letter that is in the possession of a shrewd criminal. </p><p> The investigator says: </p><p> 1. An ordinary criminal would hide the letter in a very secret place. </p><p> 2. This man is not an ordinary criminal. </p><p> 3. Therefore he will not hide it in a. very secret place. </p><p> 1. He will hide the letter where no one will look for it. </p><p> 2. Some place in full view is where no one will look for it. </p><p> 3. Therefore the letter is in some place in full view. </p><p> He thereupon visited the criminal's house, looked about the room, and saw the letter fully exposed to view, as he had anticipated by deductive reasoning. </p><p> 1. Use deductive reasoning in all public and private discussions. There are innumerable general principles upon which the world is agreed. </p><p> 2. Select one such principle and show that the case in hand falls under it. </p><p> 3. Then draw your conclusion. </p><p> You may proceed somewhat as follows in a sales talk: </p><p> 1. Remind your prospective purchaser that certain new styles have become popular, a premise that he wilL accept </p><p> 2. Prove to him by specific example, by reference, or by any other means, that your goods are in full accordance with new styles. </p><p> 3. He will then agree with you that your goods are worthy of consideration. </p><p> In deductive reasoning it is necessary: </p><p> 1. To state the principle first. </p><p> 2. To prove that a specific fact falls under the principle. </p><p> 3. Proceed clearly, slowly, and emphatically, keeping the three steps in mind, and you are certain to achieve success. </p><p> </p><p> PROBLEMS. </p><p> 1. Prepare a sales talk based on deductive reasoning. </p><p> 2. Prepare a political argument in which you refer ta a well recognized principle as basis for your belief. </p><p> 3. Make a nomination speech in which you use deductive steps to show that your candidate is the one whoshould be elected. </p><p>

Speak briefly and to the point. </p><p> 16. Be interesting. </p><p> 17. Make use of humor. </p><p> 18. Be epigrammatic. </p><p> 19. Use personal slogans. </p><p> 20. Use the direct question instead of using criticism, or expressing doubt. </p><p> 21. Use inductive speech when your hearers are not likely to accept your own conclusions. </p><p> 22. Use deductive speech in all ordinary sales talks and arguments. </p><p> </p><p> In the first three books of this course you have mastered the three foundations of all good speech for any purpose whatever. You have learned: </p><p> 1. The physical foundations of speech. </p><p> 2. The correct and effective use of words. </p><p> 3. The general psychology of speech. </p><p> Now you are to turn to the practical uses of speech. In Book IV you will learn how to use speech effectively in daily business life. </p><p> </p><p>
