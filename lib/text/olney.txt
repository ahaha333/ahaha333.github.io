Making the past live again in the present and for a future that would otherwise know nothing of it is similar to describing the African world for an outsider otherwise altogether less ignorant of it. One may surmise that this desire to inform the world outside provides a major motive in African autobiography by the fact that the great majority of the autobiographies were originally written in either English or French, that is, in one of the languages of the outside world. This mediation between two worlds (cf. the title of Mugo Gatheru’s autobiography—Child of Two Worlds—and Dilim Okafor-Omali’s biography of his father—A Nigerian Villager in Two Worlds) has provided the African intellectual and writer with his special role and his most common theme in fiction as in autobiography. Also, however, because the African world has been so utterly unknown to the West, the mediatorial and informative function, especially when performed by an unscrupulous and non-intellectual autobiographer, has led to some eminently grotesque results. The autobiography called Alice Princess, for example, (introduced and given its prevailing tone of simpering idiocy by Ralph Edwards), describe the great humanitarian act that brought Alice Princess (Msumba) Siwundhla from ‘primitive,’ ‘heathen,’ ‘superstitious,’ ‘filthy,’ ignorant,’ ‘tribal’ Africa (specifically Nyasaland) to wonderful, warmhearted, generous, Christian, clean, modern America (specifically Los Angeles and Alabama) to appear on ‘This is Your Life.’ More wonderful perhaps than Alice Princess’ memories, but no less grotesque, are some of the events of African life retailed to an amazed foreign public by Bata Kindai Amgoza ibn LoBagola (whose book, LoBagola: An African Savage’s Own Story, Jahn and Dressler rudely bibliography as a forgery). LoBagola is a sort of Gulliver’s Travels, except that it is supposedly written by a ‘savage, fitted out with some very strange customs indeed, surrounded by such frightening creatures as pygmy cannibals, and capable of throwing in snatches of odd language now and then for the sake of verisimilitude. LoBagola tells how and why he married, ‘Gooma, the Princess’ (because she ‘had saved my life from the wounded man-eating lion, by stopping it in its course with a poisoned assegai’) but he says he was not allowed to consummate the marriage because the clever and courageous but unfortunate Gooma had committed a ritual offense; however, somewhat later—at the age of eleven or twelve—he married five other wives in a single ceremony and by them produced fourteen boys (he neglects to say how many girls) in less than two years from the date of marriage. It is a matter of interesting speculation what the child-wonder LoBagola might have been able to accomplish if he had been allowed his favorite, ‘Gooma, the Princess,’ among his other wives. LoBagola comments, more in sorrow and disbelief than in anger, on the extreme skepticism of an Englishman who dared to doubt the story that LoBagola produced regularly on demand for paying audiences: “It is the same in the United States today. People all over the country try to show that I am deceiving people in this story of my life. They have told me to my face that I never saw Africa; that I was born somewhere in western Pennsylvania or in some place in the South (pp. 257-58). Whether he was born in western Pennsylvania, in the South, or in the French Sudan, as he claimed, LoBagola’s story, though sometimes entertaining, clearly does not give the reader the secure sense that he gets from the autobiographical writings of Joseph Seid, Jomo Kenyatta, Ezekiel Mphalele, or Mbonu Ojike of being informed about a real, historical, and existent Africa.

The formal variety of African autobiography is more quickly dealt with. At one extreme there is the factual and chronological record of a certain part of a life, with no attempt to impose a thematic pattern or to discover any significance in what happened: Antera Duke’s diary provides one kind of example, Equiano’s Narrative and Cole’s Kosoh Town Boy another. A step removed from this, and perhaps the most common variety of autobiography from Africa (or anywhere), is the factual but “plotted,” or thematically arranged, narrative: for example, Mugo Gatheru’s Child of Two Worlds, Alfred Hutchinson’s Road to Ghana, Boubou Hama’s Kotia-Nama. Cultural autobiography takes advantage of the fact that the life of the individual African is so closely related to the life of those around him; it describes a community existence in conjunction with a personal narrative: Kenyatta’s Facing Mount Kenya, for example, or Akiga’s Story or Mbonu Ojike’s My Africa. The autobiographical novel—say Mphalele’s The Wanderers or Dadié’s Climbié or Selormey’s The Narrow Path—transfers the personal experience of the writer more or less directly into the material of fiction. In a larger body of fictional work, taking a longer, multi-generational view of his experience, a writer like Chinua Achebe dramatizes the cultural autobiography of his people. The last step in this circle of expanding significance, which begins in individual autobiographical experience and moves outwards toward a fictional embrace of family, clan, culture, and Africa, is taken in a novel like Yambo Ouologuem’s Bound to Violence, where the person whose “autobiography” is attempted is no less than the symbolic African and the content of the autobiographical presentation is no less than the whole of African history. Though they need not detain us, one should mention those “autobiographical” books in which not only the events are imaginary rather than historical but the authors are a fiction as well—that is, those works which purport to be written by Africans but which either certainly were not or probably were not: “Akosua Abbs,” Ashanti Boy (by M. E. Nockolds); “Georges Diallo,” La nuit de destin (by le Révérend Père Georges Janssens); and, of course, “LoBagola,” LoBagola (by God knows whom).
