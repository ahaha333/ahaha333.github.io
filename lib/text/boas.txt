INTRODUCTION </p><p>
Subject matter: History of mankind. The science of anthropology deals with the history of human society. It differs from history in the narrower sense of the term in that its inquiries are not confined to the periods for which written records are available and to peoples who had developed the art of writing. Anthropological researches extend over the whole of humanity regardless of time and space. Historical inquiry reaches out hesitatingly beyond the domain of written records. Archaeological and later remains, and survivals of early times that persist in modern culture, are utilized to extend the span of time and to fill in details for which written records are not available. In these inquiries the fields of anthropology and history are in close contact.</p><p>
Since anthropology deals with mankind as a whole, the problem of the earliest appearance of man and his rise from lower forms, the differentiation of human races, and the development of languages and of cultural forms are included in its field of researches. Every manifestation of human life must be utilized to clear up the inarch of historical events.</p><p>
In anthropological research relating to early times and primitive people the individual appears rarely, if ever. For prehistoric times no record of individual activity exists, and the tradition of illiterate peoples gives no clue of considerable value or reliability throwing light upon the influence of individuals upon historical events. In the general history of humanity the individual disappears in the social group to which he belongs. Among illiterate peoples the dynamic processes that shape history must be studied mainly by observation of the living generations.</p><p>
Methods: Archaeology. It may well be asked whether a history of mankind can be reconstructed when no written records of events are available. Archaeological remains may be placed in chronological order by a study of the sequence of deposits in which they ate found. Under favorable conditions, as for instance in Scandinavia, the regularity of deposits permits even a fairly accurate chronological de-</p><p>
termination of the age of deposits. In other cases also an approximate absolute chronology is made possible by means of geological or other evidence.</p><p>
Sometimes remains may be dated through affiliation with objects of known age that belong to neighboring cultures for which written records are available. Thus many of the remains of past cultures of Europe have been dated with a fair degree of certainty. The written records of Egypt and western Asia throw light upon the history of contemporaneous European peoples who lacked the art of writing.</p><p>
Archaeology, however, can do no more than give us a very partial record of the life qf man. The earlier the time of deposit and the more unfavorable the climate for the preservation of objects, the more fragmentary will be the remains, for only the most resistant material will outlast the ravages of time. Even under the most favorable conditions only the remains of the material culture of man will be preserved. Nothing pertaining to the intangible aspects of life can be rescued with the help of the spade. Thus we may learn about skeletal types, about implements and utensils used, about the steps in their manufacture; but no information is forthcoming to tell us about languages, customs, and beliefs. These are evanescent, and there would be no way of recovering them if they did not leave traces in the lives of later generations.</p><p>
Methods: Comparative. The science of linguistics shows most clearly how and to what extent conditions found at the present time may be utilized for reconstructing the past. The written history of some European languages carries us back to periods that lie centuries before our era. Sanskrit is known for even earlier periods. Linguistic science, by comparing the present forms of speech and their known development, has enabled us to reconstruct the history of words and of grammatical forms and to demonstrate that most of the languages of Europe and many of those of western Asia are derived from a common fundamental source which in course of time has given rise by differentiation to the modern languages. The ancient language cannot be reconstructed, but the probable forms of many roots and in part the manner of their grammatical treatment can be discovered. Comparison of related forms throws light upon the history of their differentiation. Experience has shown that studies of this kind, particularly in languages for which no historic records exist, must be carried on with great caution, because accidental similarities occurring in the speech forms of remote parts of the world may easily give a</p><p>
deceptive impression of relationship. For this reason geographical contiguity is not unimportant in the interpretation of isolated similarities in vocabulary or grammar.</p><p>
Limitations of comparative method. The study of cultural forms may avail itself of similar methods. The geographical distribution of the same or decidedly similar cultural traits may be utilized for a reconstruction of cultural dissemination and development. When only slight and incidental cultural similarities occur, caution is necessary in assuming historical connections.</p><p>
It is one of the important methodological problems of anthropology to investigate how far geographical distribution. of cultural phenomena may be used for historical reconstruction. The mere fact of historical connection may be interpreted in diverse ways, for ordinarily there is no evidence of chronological sequence. Dissemination may have occurred in one of at least two opposite directions, so that it may be impossible to determine the source of cultural elements. Neither is it possible to be sure whether a particular phase of culture is not rather the local development of a widely spread ancient trait that has flourished than the source from which the more generalized trait sprang.</p><p>
Similar problems confront us, although not to the same extent, in the study of bodily form. When the same bodily type occurs among the inhabitants of neighboring countries there is little doubt as to their common origin. When slight similarities are found in regions far apart it is conceivable that this may be due to common origin or to parallel biological development.</p><p>
The study of the geographical distribution of similarities, if used with due caution, is a means of clearing up part of the history of mankind. The materials secured by these methods reveal a fragmentary picture at least of its course.</p><p>
Problems of laws of historic development. When these data are assembled the question arises whether they present an orderly picture, or whether history proceeds haphazardly; in other words, whether an orthogenetic development of human forms may be discovered and whether a regular sequence of stages of historical development may be recognized. If this were true, definite laws governing historical sequences could be formulated.</p><p>
Historic sequences. These problems may be attacked from two points of view. We may compare the observed sequences and see whether in all parts of the world they fall into regular order or whether each area has its own peculiar character that is not comparable with the sequences observed in other districts.</p><p>
Dynamics of change. We may also study the changes that are happening under our eyes in various countries and observe how they are brought about. If homologous sources of change are found, they may be called laws of social change and we may expect that they manifest themselves in every country and among every people. Biological, linguistic, and cultural change may be studied from this angle. For these inquiries we have to understand the interrelations between individual and society: the life of the individual as controlled by his social experience, and the modifications that society undergoes through the actions of individuals. We must also inquire whether society as a whole undergoes autonomous changes, biological, linguistic, and cultural, in which the individual plays a passive role. We might call this subject the dynamics of cultural change.</p><p>
Problems of anthropology. These considerations enable us to define three great problems of anthropology:</p><p>
1. The reconstruction of human history.</p><p>
2. The determination of types of historical phenomena and their sequences.</p><p>
3. The dynamics of change.</p><p>
These problems have to be investigated in the domains of biological and of social phenomena. The latter include language, the study of which, on account of its technical requirements, is best separated from other cultural manifestations.</p><p>
Aspects of culture: Man and nature. Culture itself is many-sided. It includes the multitude of relations between man and nature; the procuring and preservation of food; the securing of shelter; the ways in which objects of nature are used as implements and utensils; and all the various ways in which man utilizes or controls, or is controlled by, his natural environment: animals, plants, the inorganic world, the seasons, and wind and weather.</p><p>
Man and man. A second large group of cultural phenomena relate to the interrelation between members of a single society and between those belonging to different societies. The bonds of family, of tribe, and of a variety of social groups are included in it, as well cs the gradation of rank and influence; the relations of sexes and of old and youne; and in more complex societies the whole political and religious organization. Here belong also the relations social groups in war and peace.</p><p>
Subjective aspects. A third group consists of the subjective reactions of man to all the manifestations of life contained in the first two groups. These are of intellectual and emotional nature and may be expressed in thought and feeling as well as in action. They include all rational attitudes and those valuations which we include under the terms of ethics, esthetics, and religion.</p><p>
Interrelations between the various aspects of social life. In a systematic presentation of the data of anthropology we are compelled to treat these subjects separately. Nevertheless the biological and cultural life of man is a whole, and we cannot do justice to all the important problems of human history if we treat social life as though it were the sum of all these separate elements. It is necessary to understand life and culture as a whole.</p><p>
Descriptive anthropology. A descriptive anthropology would represent the lives of all the peoples of the world and of all times. Certain types may be selected, and a number of peoples will appear as varieties of such types. According to the purpose of the presentation, the order may be geographical, if primarily intended to elucidate the order of cultural phenomena in space and time; or it may be according to types, if the object is the study of laws of sequence or the investigation of dynamic relations.</p><p>
Anthropology, history, and sociology. While the results of the former arrangement connect anthropology with history, those of the latter connect it with sociology. If regular cultural sequences could be found, these would represent an orderly historical cycle. If laws of sequence and of social dynamics could be found, these would be sociological laws. It is one of the important tasks of anthropology to determine how far such regular sequences and sociological laws exist.</p><p>
When this task has been achieved the principal problem remains, that of understanding a culture as a whole. Neither history nor sociological laws are of considerable help in its solution. History may tell us the sources from which bodily form, customs, and beliefs have been derived, but it does not convey any information regarding the way in which a people will behave owing to the transmitted characteristics. Sociology may teach us the morphology and general dynamics of society; it will give us only a partial insight into the complex interaction of forces, so that it is not possible to predict the behavior resulting from the historical events that made the people</p><p>
what they are. This problem is essentially a psychological one and beset wit'h all the difficulties inherent in the investigation of complex mental phenomena of the lives of individuals.</p><p>
Purpose of book. The purpose of the present book is to present those data that are necessary for an intelligent handling of the problems here outlined.</p><p>

CHAPTER III</p><p>
RACE</p><p>
FRANZ BOAS</p><p>
Races and local types. In descriptions of the anatomical characteristics of the principal races, only those traits are discussed which set off one large group from the other and which are common to all its members. The lesser differences between individuals and between neighboring local groups are naturally disregarded. Thus a somewhat schematic view of the bodily characteristics of the varieties of mankind is obtained unless the characteristics of the individuals composing a local group or a race are clearly understood. We have to consider the characteristics of a population before we can take up a description of races.</p><p>
Variability of local types. A description of a population cannot be given in a summary way, but must consist of an enumeration and description of all its component forms. Their frequency distribution is the only way by which an exhaustive description can be given. When alternative forms are distinguished, such as blue eyes and those not blue, or blood of distinct chemical behavior, the frequency of occurrence of each type must be given. Since in most cases the differences between the observed forms, like stature or headforms, are of such character that differences between the individuals of a population who are alike in form are minute, verbal descriptions are no longer satisfactory; numerical values must take their place. For this reason the description of a population is largely based on anthro-pometric studies. The dimension of the body, grades of pigmentation, numerical values of chemical constituents, frequency and grade of development of characteristic anatomical traits, are substituted for vaguer descriptions. For these reasons the method to be used is analogous to the one employed in the study of any type of variable quantities. It is the statistical method.</p><p>
Methods of observations. Detailed methods of the study of the human body have been elaborated. These are based in part on morphological observations but much more on quantitative determinations</p><p>
of various measures of linear extent, area, and volume of the body and its organs; on the frequency of occurrence of various forms; on attempts at quantitative studies of the chemical properties and physical functions of the organism.</p><p>
By far the greatest attention has been paid to a determination of form by means of measurements, and more attention has been given to the bony structure than to any other part of the body. The reason for this is not that the bony structure is more important, but that nothing else remains of past generations, and a comparison between present and past can be based only on comparisons of skeletons. The comparative study of soft parts is receiving increasing attention in anatomical institutes but has not been elaborated to the same extent as the observation of the skeleton and of easily ascertainable measures on the living, many of which depend largely upon the dimensions of bony structures.</p><p>
The size of the body is measured by stature (the height standing in erect posture), by weight, and sometimes by volume. The length of the limbs is measured on the skeleton by the length of the long bones; on the living, by the determination with the greatest possible accuracy of the corresponding lengths. The transversal measures of the body are determined at the shoulder girdle, in connection with the length of arms by the span between the tips of the second fingers of the horizontally extended arms, on various points of the chest, and on the hips. Antcroposterior measures are taken on chest and pelvis. Further information regarding size and form of the body, in conjunction with the linear measures, is given by the determination of the circumference at various levels.</p><p>
A comprehensive system of measurements of the head, respectively of the skull, has been developed. The head measures most commonly used on the living are length of head, measured from the glabella (the point between the eyebrows) to the most distant point of the occiput; the greatest transversal diameter of the head; and the greatest width of the face measured between the zygomatic arches. These are preferred on the living, because they can be taken with the greatest accuracy since the points from which the measurements have to be taken are well defined and the soft parts covering these regions are rather thin. Height of nose and face are determined with much greater difficulty. Measurements on the skull may be taken with much greater accuracy, since the bone is unyielding and the points may be accurately determined.
 
On account of the importance of obtaining accurate and comparable measurements, it has been found advantageous to define and name those points which are utilized. Figure shows the points, and the legend gives their definition.</p><p>
When comparing the conformation of two skulls it is obviously important to bring them into homologous positions, because the apparent slope of the forehead or the apparent degree of prognathism will depend upon the position chosen. Generally the attempt is made to place the skull as nearly as possible in its natural position when looking straight ahead, and two planes are principally used as nearly coinciding with this position: namely, the plane passing along the lowest points of the occipital condyles and the prosthion (alveolar point), or the one passing on each side of the head through the central point of the upper rim of the meatus auditorius and the lowest point of the lower rim of the orbit. By giving to these pairs of points a stable position, all other points are made the more variable the farther removed they are. In a purely morphological study the two objects studied should be made to approach each other as near as possible in all points.</p><p>
The natural horizontal position is particularly important for determining the characteristic physiognomic angles of the face and forehead. The alveolar arch and the teeth appear more prominent, the forehead flatter, when the skull is tilted back more than it is in normal position; the reverse is true when it is tilted forward. On account of the uncertainty of the normal position, some of these angles are more safely determined by means of measurements of lines drawn between fixed points of the skull.</p><p>
Observations on other points can also be made with much greater accuracy on the skeleton than on the living. Here also exact measurements of dimensions and angles have been made exhibiting differences between individuals and racial groups. Thus the relative lengths of the extremities show considerable differences both individually and in racial groups. Details of form and curvature of single bones have also been described by means of metrical methods.</p><p>
The soft parts of the body may be studied with a fair degree of accuracy on plaster casts, partly because the material is unyielding, partly because lines may be studied that are not readily observed on the living. As an example the cross section of the faces of two Indian tribes may be given (Fig. 11).</p><p>
Besides measurable dimensions and angles many significant forms occur which cannot be readily represented by numerical values. Irregularities in the development of bones, such as the persistence of the suture dividing the two frontal bones and the occurrence of a ridge along the middle of the palate, may be described according to their frequency and intensity, but are not readily measured. This is even more true of such complex configurations as the fingerprints which may be classified and occur with varying frequency in local groups.</p><p>
Types. The anatomical characteristics of individuals may be described by many measurements. Some of these may be related, so that the one determines, at least in part, the other one. Thus among the members of the same population a wide face may be found together with a wide head; broad shoulders with broad hips; a long arm with a long leg. Others are very slightly related, if at all. Transversal measures are in general slightly those in a line from feet to head. The width Indians of coast of of the foot is hardly related at all to the length of the head, and so on. </p><p>
If we describe individuals composing a population by a number of measurements that are not related, and count how many will have the most frequent measurements, it appears that only very few are what we might call typical specimens of the population. When we count the one half who have the normal length of head, and of these the one half who have the normal length of foot, meaning by this that we consider as "normal" those who belong to the middle half of the population, we see that only one fourth of the total number will have the normal form in regard to both characteristics. If new independent measures are added, the third one will be found combined with the first two with only one half of one fourth, or one eighth of the whole number. If ten such measures are considered, then only one individual among will have the normal measures in all these ten traits. Since a type has many characteristics, some of which are unrelated while others are more or less closely or loosely related, it follows that very few individuals will correspond to what we might call the norm of the population. The norm is an abstraction which is hardly ever found realized in any single individual.</p><p>
There are, however, cases in which a population is so uniform in regard to special traits that these impress themselves as the prominent characteristics. Examples are the blondness in some parts of Sweden and the flat occiput in parts of Asia Minor.</p><p>
Types are also subjectively construed in another manner. When the observer has become familiar with two populations and has formed his impression of their "types" and turns his attention to a third population in which both of these types may be recognized, he will be inclined to consider this new population as mixed, although there is nothing to prove that it may not be genetically a type quite analogous to those previously studied. The taxonomic classification thus obtained would not necessarily represent a genetic fact which would have to be investigated by the study of family lines (see also p. 19).</p><p>
Phenotypes and genotypes. The whole population consists of families, and the bodily form of each individual depends not only upon the characteristics of the population as a whole, but primarily upon those of the family (genotype) to which he belongs- In a population of absolutely uniform descent all the constituent families would be alike. This would be expressed by the fact that the averages and variabilities of each family line, provided there were very many children, would be the same. These values can be computed. Experience shows that there is not a single population in which the family lines are identical. Their uniformity is the greater the more the community has for a long time been inbred, while a recent intermingling of different lines of descent results in considerable differences between family lines. Since the population as a whole is composed of many family lines, the characteristics of every one of these are not those of the whole population. The population as a whole, representing many family lines or genotypes, is called a phenotype. The brothers and sisters constituting one genotype would also differ the less among themselves, the more uniform the ancestry of the population. On the other hand, in an inbred population of mixed descent the family lines may be very much alike, while the brothers and sisters, designated as fraternities, may be very unlike among themselves. 1</p><p>
Graphically this may be represented in the following way: Families of approximately the middle type will be frequent, while those divergent from the middle family lines will be rare. In each family line there will be differences between the members of the fraternity; and on the whole, the amount of variability in each fra-</p><p>
ternity will be about equal. This will result in a distribution as indicated in Figure 12, for clarity's sake in somewhat exaggerated form. Generalized types. If it were possible to reconstruct generalized types, we might obtain a better insight into the origin of the modern local races. Pronounced local types develop with age and are clearest in the adult male, somewhat less so in the female, and least of all in infants. In prenatal stages the differences are still slighter. It is well known that the study of embryology throws much light upon the morphological significance of the parts of the body, for there are decided similarities of structure between the early stages of the organs in different species and even orders. In other words, the most generalized forms may be recognized in the earliest stages of individual development. We may therefore conclude that the early stages of development show the more generalized forms which in later life become differentiated.</p><p>
This may readily be observed in the development of the individual. Very young children do not exhibit all the pronounced characteristics of the race to which they belong. The Negro foetus may be distinguished from the White foetus in proportions of the body, but the differences are less than those found among adults. The children of European types with dark hair are often light blond as young children. The form of the nose of children of most races does not exhibit the pronounced differences found among adults, because the bridge of the nose develops only during maturity.</p><p>
Another approach to the problem is through an investigation of those traits which are most constant in larger groups. It seems plausible that traits which are common to large groups of mankind must be very ancient, while those showing similar types of variation in distinct groups have presumably developed independently and at a later time.</p><p>
Among the most constant forms that belong to large divisions of mankind are forms of hair, pigmentation, and form of nose, while most of the proportions of the body are more variable. This justifies the attempt to classify mankind on this basis and to distinguish as ancient ancestral forms the Negro, including Negroes of Africa and Melanesia, with dark skin and frizzly black hair; the Australian, with dark skin and wavy black hair; the Mongolian, including the American Indian, with straight hair, slighter pigmentation, and somewhat elevated bridge of nose; and the European, with varying form and color of hair, slight pigmentation, and narrow nose. There are other bodily traits that coincide more or less strictly with this classification, such as the form of the eye â€” wide open among Negroes and Europeans, with a heavy fold of the upper eyelid in the Mongolians; thickness of lips â€” greatest among Negroes and Australians, less so among Mongolians, least among the Whites.</p><p>
In contrast to these the form of the head as seen from above shows wide variations in each race; elongated in one Negro group, rounded in another. Certainly this type cannot belong to the fundamental racial traits. It would seem that this is rather a parallel development which occurred independently in various racial types.</p><p>
Parallel development. The genealogical grouping of races is made difficult by the possibility of occurrence of parallel traits in different groups of mankind. A difficulty of this kind is found in the interpretation of the bodily forms of the Ainu of northern Japan. They differ from their Mongoloid neighbors in certain traits that approach the bodily forms of the Europeans. Particularly the abundant hairiness of the body sets them off strongly from their neighbors, and it has been inferred that they must be descendants of a European group that migrated east to the Pacific Ocean. A similar case is that of the Tlingit and Haida of the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia. While most Indians are characterized by dark hair, deep pigmentation of the eye, and a moderate pigmentation of the skin, we find here individuals of very light skin color, red hair, and light brown eyes. This is not due to intermingling with Whites, for Shakes, the Tlingit chief who met the first European vessel that touched this coast, was characterized by these traits, a fact still remembered by his descendants. The "blond Eskimo" of Coronation Gulf present a similar variant. It seems therefore likely that the loss of pigmentation may be a trait which occurs sporadically among the Mongoloid type among groups that have no immediate genetic relation to Europeans. It follows from these remarks that we must be cautious in assuming a necessary genetic relationship between forms showing similarities that jpay be due to parallelism of development.</p><p>
Selection. Whenever the mating between genetic types is entirely due to chance â€” in other words, whenever an individual of one type may mate with equal probability with any one of the other types, and when the population has been stable for a long time, the distribution of forms in the population will also be stable. In modern populations these conditions do not prevail. In New York, for instance, a person of European descent is much more likely to mate with another European, a Negro with another Negro, than is a European to mate with a Negro. To a lesser extent this is true of other groups. There is a decided social selection between the social groups. The probability that an Italian of the first generation will marry a Scandinavian of the first generation is not equal to the probability that an Italian will marry an Italian. Since the social groups such as Italians, Irish, Poles, Scandinavians, are not genetically identical, we have to take into consideration this inequality which results in changes of the genetic composition and which lasts until the selective mating disappears.</p><p>
Similar conditions prevail in every population in which selective mating occurs, unless the genetic lines are equally distributed in all the classes in which selection occurs. Such equality does not exist in modern populations. Since in every population, even in small tribes, a number of distinct genetic lines occur, preferential cross cousin marriages, such as are found in many tribes, together with avoidance of parallel cousin marriages, must also be a disturbing element in the distribution of genetic traits.</p><p>
It follows from all this that in most cases the distribution of genetic types, and hence that of physical types, in a population is not constant, but that gradual changes due to hereditary causes must be frequent. The character of these changes is due to the differences in physical form among the genetic types upon which the selective processes are at work. When there is no relation between social grouping and the genetic character of each group, no change due to selective mating will occur.</p><p>
Environmental changes. Environmental conditions bring about slight modifications of human forms. Their influence is clear so far as the bulk of the body is concerned. The constant vigorous use of muscles of the arm results in forms different from those brought about by</p><p>
disuse. Ample nutrition and semi-starvation affect the form of the body. Diseases of early childhood may even result in modifications of the skeleton. It is necessary to determine how far the body responds to the differences of environment.</p><p>
In a single individual it would be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between environmental and hereditary causes. The bulk of the body, for instance, may be due to either cause. It may be influenced by favorable conditions of growth and adequate nutrition, or it may be largely determined by hereditary causes. At the present time a distinction between the two causes is in most cases impossible.</p><p>
Population and race. Since populations consist of many distinct family lines, the question arises: What is a race? The genotypes are stable within a population. They form a continuous series, and while the extremes may be quite distinct, they are connected by many transitional forms. Apparently identical individuals are found in populations that live in contiguous territories. It is not possible to assign with any degree of certainty any individual, judged by his bodily form, to a particular population, excepting extreme forms and unusually marked local differences. Still, when areas far apart are compared, the two populations appear as decidedly distinct. A comparison of Europe and Africa illustrates this.</p><p>
In general usage local forms â€” that is, populations â€” are described as local races, but it must be understood that this is merely a convenient way of describing the characteristics of a local form and that it does not prove that the local form is descended from an ancient fundamental variety of mankind. All we find at the present time are populations each containing markedly distinct family lines or genotypes which appear in ever-changing combinations.</p><p>
In a strict sense a race must be defined as a group of common origin and of stable type. In this sense extreme forms like the Australians, Negroes, Mongolians, and Europeans may be described as races because each has certain characteristics which set them off from other groups, and which are strictly hereditary. Difficulties arise if forms are considered in which the racial characteristics are not pronounced. Since each population consists of many different genotypes, the problem arises whether it is possible to analyze the genotypes in such a way as to determine constituent fundamental races. In such an attempt we are all too ready to consider the extreme types as fundamental forms, without considering that these are established on the purely subjective impression of their striking</p><p>
differences. It is not necessary to assume that the intermediate types are always mixed types. They may well be the fundamental forms of which the extremes are variants. The simple description of the population does not answer this question. In mixed races like the Mulattoes, the parental types of which are known, the individuals and their family lines may be grouped according to their greater or lesser resemblance with the one or the other race. When they are so grouped, the pure types, Whites and Negroes, stand at the ends of these series.</p><p>
When the original intermingling types are unknown, the analysis of the descriptive features cannot lead to a similar result, because according to the laws of Mcndelian inheritance the individual traits separate and recombine, and it is not possible to reconstruct with any degree of certainty the "pure" ancestral types. All that can be done is to distinguish arbitrarily certain morphological forms as "pure" types, arid then arrange all the others statistically in intermediate groups which will contain the more ancestors of the alleged "pure" types the more their forms resemble one or the other "pure"</p><p>
type.</p><p>
The problem is quite the same as that of the study of varieties of strongly varying animals or plants living in distinct localities. The farther they are removed from one another the more they are likely to differ. Sharp lines between the varieties cannot be drawn, and a reconstruction of ancestral forms is not possible.</p><p>
In some cases it can be shown that a population is actually mixed. In a perfectly homogeneous group the size of an individual will influence all his measurements. They will all increase with size, although not necessarily at the same rate. If the population is descended from two types having different measurements, these relations may be disturbed. Thus we find in northern France a population with rather long and narrow heads, and in central France one with larger short and broad heads. The effect of their mixture in Paris is that long heads are often narrow, short heads broad; in other words, the normal correlation is disturbed and considerably lower than in populations descended from a more uniform ancestry. Nevertheless, the component elements could not be reconstructed, unless they were actually found in some locality. The success of such an analysis would require an exact knowledge of the manner in which the traits in question are inherited.</p><p>
Local races. </p><p>
We have seen that the characteristics of variable traits of local races can be accounted for in several ways. These may be due to a mixture of closely allied but by origin distinct forms; differentiation may be due to isolation, local selection, or to environmental influences.</p><p>
Mixture. The history of mankind proves that mixture of different populations has been going on for thousands of years. The distribution of implements dating back to the end of the glacial period suggests that, even at this early time, extended migrations occurred. They cannot be proved, because cultural traits may be disseminated by imitation without migration. In later times, when the elements of language or skeletal remains allow us to trace wanderings, the proof can be given. In Europe the Greeks invaded the Mediterranean at the end of the second millenium before our era. The people of Thrace migrated into Asia Minor, the Celts expanded their territory into Italy and wandered as far as Asia Minor; the Roman traders established colonies over a large part of Europe; the Germanic tribes migrated from the Black Sea into western and southern Europe, and into North Africa; the Arabs swept over North Africa and settled with North Africans in Spain; the Slavs superseded the Finnish people of Russia; the Bulgarians migrated from the Black Sea into the Balkan Peninsula; the Magyars into Hungary; Mongolian invasions of Europe followed. The European populations were almost constantly on the move until individual landholding developed and the people became attached to the soil. Remote parts, like Spain and England, were not spared the effects of such intermingling. The Jewish and Armenian diaspora were, notwithstanding their social isolation, undoubtedly accompanied by intermingling. The expulsion of people like that of the Moors and Jews from Spain could not obliterate the results of previous mixture. In Portugal plantations were worked by Negroes, but the Negro element has disappeared in the modern population. After the great Greek, Celtic, and Teutonic migrations, the Crusades and the numerous wars must have contributed to this process. In recent times the development of large cities has given a new stimulus to the process of intermingling of distinct local types. It has received its strongest impulse through the colonization of America, Australia, and South Africa.</p><p>
Early conditions on other continents were not different. Although we have no historical data for Africa, America, and Polynesia, the linguistic and anatomical evidence is clear. The Bantu tribes of Africa spread over the greater part of the continent, and presumably supplanted an old pygmy or pygmoid population. In the Sudan there occurred invasions of people from the Mediterranean border of Africa; Abyssinia was peopled by Semitic invaders. In North America the sporadic distribution of Athapascan tribes from Alaska and the MacKenzie area along the Pacific coast to Arizona and New Mexico, the occurrence of Algonquian languages along the Western Plains and in the East, the relationship between the Cherokee of North Carolina and the Iroquois of New York, are proofs of extended migrations. In South America the distribution of the Caribs and Arawak shows displacements which extended over thousands of miles. In Asia historical, linguistic, and anthropological evidence gives clear proofs of migrations. The Malay crossed the Indian Ocean and settled in Madagascar. The Aryans in India, the Central Asiatic invasions southward and westward, the extension of the Turks westward into Europe and northward into Siberia, are a few examples. Owing to these conditions we may expect to find practically everywhere intermixture between various ancestral types which cannot be reconstructed by means of an analysis of the morphological traits of a population.</p><p>
Isolation. It seems likely that, notwithstanding the mobility of the human race, there have been periods of isolation of small bands. In early times populations must have been sparse, and opportunities for isolation, partly for geographical and partly for social reasons, must have been frequent. Even in recent times there have been such areas of isolation, as for instance among the Eskimo tribe of Smith Sound in Greenland, in Australia, and on remote islands of the Pacific Ocean. Biological evidence shows that in cases of isolation with long-continued inbreeding well-defined types develop, no matter whether they are all descended from one ancestral type, or whether they are of mixed origin. Examples of such divergence of locally circumscribed variations are found in the Galapagos Islands, where lizards and birds of each island have well-marked characteristics that set them off from those of neighboring islands; or in some of the Polynesian islands where the snails of each valley have their own characteristics. We may discover such phenomena in man. Thus the Indians of some valleys of California differ in type from their neighbors, and in the Austrian Alps the inhabitants of the remote villages are markedly individualized.</p><p>
It therefore seems admissible to assume that early isolation was a means of establishing distinctive types which persist in the more local races. This is illustrated also by the frequent occurrence of certain anomalies in small local groups. In the adult the parts of the occipital bone of man are fused, but sometimes the upper portion, the squama, which forms the occiput, is separated from the lower part (Fig. 13). This conformation is remarkably common among some Pueblo tribes of New Mexico. It must be considered a family trait which, on account of inbreeding, has become unusually prevalent in these communities. This is analogous to hereditary pathological forms which occur with unusual frequency in some family lines or
communities. The smaller and the more strictly inbred the community, the more we are likely to find a pronounced local type.</p><p>
Differences of this kind can never be greater than the whole range of variations which occurred in the original population from which the isolated group became separated. It may therefore well be that the ancestral type contained a great number of variants that are now found with greater frequency in one locality which possesses local characteristics.</p><p>
Domestication. For a clear understanding of the significance of racial differentiation we must not lose sight of the conditions in which man lives in all parts of the world.I Man is the oldest domesticated form, self-domesticated by his inventions. The fundamental characteristics of the life of domesticated animals consist in the artificial control of food supply, in the modification of food consumed, and in artificial protection against enemies. The careful inbreeding of selected stable strains which characterizes modern methods of raising domesticated animals does not belong to early domestication and, except in a few cases, has not been an important clement in the history of mankind. It can hardly be adduced as a factor in race formation.</p><p>
The foundation for domestication was laid when man developed the use of tools for his protection, and particularly when he discovered the use of fire and began to modify his food by roasting and cooking and gave up the habits of a roaming animal that lived on the food that his hands and teeth could procure for him. Fire was used by man in middle Paleolithic times, about 35,000 or 50,000 years ago, long before animals became associated with him in his</p><p>
camp. The first to draw attention to the domestication of man were Johannes Ranke and Eduard Hahn.</p><p>
It is therefore not surprising to see that man participates in those traits that differentiate domesticated animals from wild forms. Perhaps most striking are the changes in pigmentation and hair forms that are concomitants of the transition from wild life to domesticated life. There are hardly any wild forms known that have the peculiar pigmentation characteristic of blondness, often accompanied by loss of pigmentation of the iris which results in blueness of eye. The microscopical structure of the blue eye of the "Nordic" is, so far as pigmentation is concerned, identical with that of the blue-eyed rabbit. The blondness of hair is identical with that of the blond horses and pigs. On the other hand, blackness is also rare among wild mammals. The fur coats of the black panther and black bear are among the exceptions. Almost all domesticated forms â€” cattle, horses, dogs, cats â€” have black varieties. Furthermore, the form and amount of hair of domesticated forms is unusually variable. Most wild animals have straight hair, and except among the anthropoid apes all parts of the body are well covered. Some domesticated varieties, like angora cats and Pekinese dogs, have an excessive amount and unusual length of hair, while others, like Mexican dogs, are almost hairless. The form of the hair is also variable. The hair of wild animals is almost always straight. Forms like that of the hair of the poodle dog do not occur. A form analogous to the frizzly Negro hair is not found in nature. In domesticated fowl similar curvatures of the feathers may be observed.</p><p>
The development of the long head hair of man is inconceivable in a wild species. It would make the arboreal life of the predecessor of man impossible and would be equally a hindrance in life in the open, unless man had learned to dress it. No mane of wild animals reaches the same excessive length.</p><p>
Another trait of domesticated animals is great variation in size. The small Shetland pony may be contrasted against the heavy dray horse, the Pekinese dog against the great Dane. In man we find similar variations in size: on the one hand the pygmy Bushman, on the other hand the tall Scotchman or the Patagonian. It is true that the great variants in domesticated animals have been raised by careful breeding, but the fact remains that such variants do not develop among wild animals. In man, we may assume, isolation played a role similar to inbreeding of domesticated animals.</p><p>
There are other characteristics of animals that are due to domestication, some of which are paralleled by traits in man, and some not. To the former group belongs the permanence of the female breast, to the latter the enlargement of the outer ear seen for instance in some races of dogs. Eugen Fischer and B. Klatt have studied in detail the analogies between the anatomy of domesticated animals and of man.</p><p>
It is not possible to decide whether the great differences between races are rather the late effect of domestication, which seems to accelerate the process of formation of distinct varieties, or whether the origin of the modern races must be looked for in remote antiquity, previous to appreciable effects of domestication. Practically all the distinguishing features of races may be paralleled by modifications that occur in domestication. The elongation of the Negro face forward and the reduction of the European face find their parallels in breeds of dogs, horses, and pigs. Variations in the relative length of limbs as compared to length of the body, and concomitant variations in the form of shoulder girdle and pelvis are common.</p><p>
Paleontological evidence, as described in the preceding chapter, does not yet give us a satisfactory clue by which we can determine the age of the existing principal races, much less the way in which they developed from a common root.</p><p>
Internal secretions. Sir Arthur Keith bases his theory of racial origins first of all upon the action of the ductless glands. It has been found that harmonious growth depends upon the proper action of a number of glands. The pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain, when overdeveloped gives rise to enlarged nose, chin, hands, and feet. The thyroid gland, which is located in front of the neck, controls growth. Its subnormal functioning causes poorly developed nose and hair and a flat face, and in extreme cases idiocy. The adrenal glands affect the color of the skin. The thymus seems to control rapidity of development. Its effect upon generation after generation is cumulative. The character of the individual is strongly influenced by the activity of these glands. Sir Arthur Keith assumes that racial differences may be due to differences in their chemical behavior. Less energetic activity of the thyroid gland may thus have influenced the somatic appearance of whole populations like the Mongols, Bushmen, and Hottentots. Deficiency of the adrenals, which control hairiness in addition to</p><p>
mentation, may be responsible for the meager growth of body hair of the Mongol and Negro as against its abundance in the European and the Australian. If this assumption is correct, the outer appearances of races might in part be influenced by the activity of the glands; but this would not give us any clue to the origin of races, since we should then be required to search for the origin of the differentiation of behavior of the glands.</p><p>
The actual changes due to environment that have been observed may well be caused by slight modification in the chemical activity of the body. This seems the more likely, since some of the changes seem to become the stronger the longer the mother has been exposed to a new environment. In recent years Sir Arthur Keith has emphasized again the influence of isolation upon the rise of local types. He even sees in modern nationalism with its concomitant isolation a process by which new types originate.</p><p>
Races of man. On account of the actual condition of modern populations a genetig^classification of mankind presents peculiar difficulties. While it is possible to describe taxonomically both the fundamentally distinct varieties which may properly be called races and local populations, we have no means at present to account for their genesis. Minor local differences may be due to early isolation and inbreeding, to intermingling of types in varying ratios, and to selection. In his migrations man has reached almost every part of the habitable world and has been exposed to the greatest variety of external conditions. This also may have been an important cause of racial differentiation. The more fundamental differences between large groups, such as the Negroes and Chinese, must be looked for in earlier differentiation.</p><p>
To a certain extent geographical distribution may give a clue to racial history. When we consider the land mass as a whole, remembering the early connection between the Old World and America in the region of Bering Sea, we recognize that a type with a moderate degree of pigmentation, straight hair, broad face, fairly large nose, rather small lips, and an eye form characterized by a heavy upper eyelid covering the inner corner of the eye inhabits a large part of Asia and America, while another type with dark pigmentation, frizzly or wavy hair, low nose, protruding face, thick lips, open eyes, and long limbs inhabits Africa, Australia, and the chain of islands stretching from New Guinea southeastward, and occurs sporadically in southern Asia. It might be said that the one group lives all around the Pacific Ocean, calling the whole of both Americas the east coast and a large part of Asia, including central Asia and Siberia, the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. The other group lives around the Indian Ocean, considering Africa as the west coast and southern Asia and Australia with the adjoining islands as the north and east coasts. Thus, at least two groups may be distinguished which, both geographically and morphologically, are fairly well defined.</p><p>
Each of these groups contains many elements that seem to possess marked individuality, and their relations to the main groups are not by any means clear. The Europeans, Australians, and African pygmies offer the greatest difficulties.</p><p>
In many respects the Australians seem to be a more generalized type and might therefore be considered as an older form that has developed in its own way. Since Australia has been separated from Asia for a long geological period, so that man and the dog are the only higher mammals existing there, it must be assumed that Australian man did not reach there until after he had learned to navigate the waters separating Asia from Australia. This accords with the observation made by Huxley that many of the South Asiatic types have Australoid characteristics. This refers for instance to the Vedda of Ceylon and other South Indian tribes. The Negroid Papua of New Guinea and many other isolated spots in southern Asia would have to be assumed, according to their geographical position, as a still later wave of migration.</p><p>
The South African pygmies are lighter in color than the Negroes. Their skin color resembles that of tanned leather. The forms of hair, face, and nose are decidedly Negroid and they are most closely affiliated with the Negro type.</p><p>
The European type is set off from all the others by the greatest degree of depigmentation. Nearest to him in this respect is the East Asiatic type, which in a number of localities exhibits the tendency to strong depigmentation. Some of the East Asiatic and American tribes are very light, and brown, wavy hair is found in a number of regions â€” for instance, in British Columbia. The nose tends to attain large size. In most cases it is rather low and heavy with wide alae, but in many regions its elevation over the face is very great â€” for instance, among the Indians of the Mississippi valley. While generally the hairiness of the body is very slight, the Ainu, who are otherwise of the same general appearance, have an abundance of body hair. Wide face and prominent cheek bones are</p><p>
a fairly general characteristic of this type, although in some localities they are quite narrow. The development of the so-called " oblique " eye, such as may be observed among the Chinese, is often much weakened. The blue lumbar spot which is probably ever present in newborn infants of this race is sporadically observable among the Europeans also. All in all, it may be said that the East Asiatic type tends to produce here and there variations that approach European types, while variations in the direction of Negroid types are exceedingly rare. Increase in pigmentation, lower noses, and protruding mouth parts are also found locally, but hardly to a greater extent than they are found in varieties of the European type. I am therefore inclined to associate the European type most closely with the East Asiatic type.</p><p>
Our picture of the principal races would thus be that of two groups of doubtful affiliation inhabiting the shores of the Indian Ocean, and of another large group inhabiting the shores of the Pacific Ocean, including both Americas and a large part of Asia, with the affiliated European type. It is obvious that this is an unduly generalized picture, because the numerous important local varieties and their morphological characteristics have been disregarded.</p><p>
Earlier classifications are based partly on morphological traits, partly on geographical location. Thus Linng distinguished and described the European, American, Asiatic, and African races; Blumenbach the Caucasian (European), Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, and Malayan.</p><p>
These divisions are based on characteristics of color and hair, and on descriptive features of the skull and face. In later classifications the form of the nose, shape of the skull, form of hair, and color were taken as the principal criteria by which races were distinguished. According to the number of elements which were considered as important, three or four or a great many more races were distinguished. Huxley establishes five races â€” Australoid, Negroid, -Mongoloid, xanthochroic, melanochroic. By a similar method Duckworth established seven principal races, based mainly on the length-breadth index of the skull, the degree of prognathism, and the cranial capacity. These are the Australian, African Negro, Andamanese, Eurasi-atic, Polynesian, Greenlandish, and South African. Roland B. Dixon used a highly artificial classification, dividing the individuals of each race, regardless of other characteristics, into fundamental types according to threefold groupings: those with long, medium round heads; with high, middle, low heads; with narrow, middle and flat noses. Thus he obtained according to the possible combination of the extreme forms eight fundamental types, such as long- and high-headed, narrow-nosed; long- and flat-headed, narrow-nosed; long- and high-headed, flat-nosed; long- and Iow-headed flat-nosed; etc. These he considered as fundamental and derived the middle forms from mixtures. There is no evidence that these mathematically derived forms have any biological significance. A. C. Haddon uses as the basis of his classification hair, skin color, stature, length of head (length-breadth index), and forms of face, nose, and eyes. J. Deniker established on similar principles six major groups and twenty-nine races.</p><p>
The latest attempt at a classification of mankind is that made by E. von Eickstedt, who distinguishes with Eugen Fischer the Euro-pid, Negrid, and Mongolid races. He divides these as follows:</p><p>
The types of Europe have been described in particular detail. The divisions made by W. Z. Ripley on the basis of previous work are still much used. He describes the blue-eyed, tall, long-headed Nordic; the darker, short-headed Alpine; and the short, longheaded Mediterranean. Later investigators have tried to establish finer divisions based largely on physiognomic traits.</p><p>
It is but natural that a finer division of human types will give varying results according to the features which are considered as of prime importance in making a classification. A division of human types that is of value for determining the genetic relations must necessarily be based on significant hereditary traits not subject to environmental modification. For this reason stature can be used only in extreme cases, since we know that individuals growing up under changed conditions may differ considerably in stature from their parents. Thus, the average stature of European populations has increased almost everywhere during the last century. Still clearer is the result of comparisons between parents and their own</p><p>
children, or between brothers and sisters growing up in different surroundings. Thus, it has been shown that the sons of one generation of Harvard students excel the stature of their own parents by 3.4 centimeters. Similar observations have been made in regard to the cephalic index, which shows considerable change in a changed environment. Thus, the average cephalic index of immigrating East European Jews is 83.0, that of their children born in America 81.4, and that of their grandchildren 78.7. The width of face also is not stable in varying environments. In Europe a gradual narrowing of the face seems to occur. If, therefore, populations are classified as tall, or of medium stature, or short; as long-, medium-, or round-headed; as broad- or narrow-faced, arbitrary limits being set for the groupings of these measures, we have a classification of taxonomic, not of genetic, value. It is entirely inadmissible to assume such classes in any sense as fundamental racial groups. The assumption of a long-headed or round-headed race can only be made when it is possible to demonstrate that these features are stable.</p><p>
It must be understood that these traits are hereditary in family lines. The genetic tendency of each individual is modified by environmental conditions. Unless the proof of stability can be given, these classes are no more than descriptions of certain populations without any implication as to the significance of the observed differences. The results of such classification will depend entirely upon the traits selected and upon the limits assumed for the arbitrary classification. If, for instance, the limits of headform are set at and less for long-headed, 75-80 as medium form, and more as round-headed, and if in another classification these limits are shifted, the results will be different. The same is true when the varying frequency of occurrence of each of these groups in each population is made the basis of classification.</p><p>
The differences between the more fundamental racial types cannot be so interpreted that one of them would be higher than the other in the sense that the differences between one type and the higher apes would, be greater than the analogous differences observed in others. On the contrary, every human type shows excessively human characteristics in certain directions. Thus the Eskimo have the largest brains and a slight amount of body hair; but proportions of limbs are not as excessively human as those of the Negroes, who also excel in development of the lips. The European has a marked narrowing of the face and elevation of the nose, most pronounced among the Armenians. At the same time their body hair is much more fully developed than that of the East Asiatics or Negroes. A scale of races in regard to their similarity to animals cannot be formed.</p><p>
Theories of the origin of modern races. It has been shown before how selection may bring about changes in the numerical frequency of types represented in a population. Without the assumption of additional causes it cannot produce new types. Darwin sought these in the cumulative effects of selection, which would establish new variants of better adaptation to the environment that would survive and crowd out the older forms. This general theory has been applied specifically to human races by assuming as essential cause the climatic changes during the Pleistocene and the migrations that were forced by them. Othenio Abel u points out the effect of the gradual desiccation and increasing elevation of central Asia upon the migration of fauna and flora westward into Europe and eastward into America. A great change occurred at the end of the Miocene. Europe before that time consisted of a number of islands. Now the continent was formed, and at the same time the gradual rise and the increasing scantiness of vegetation in central Asia brought about the first great migration of mammals westward and eastward. The characteristic fossil of this period is the three-toed horse, Ilipparion. The process of desiccation and the general rise of land continued into the glacial period. In central Asia woods had disappeared, and the higher apes substituted for the life in trees that of rock climbers like the modern baboon. In these forms Abel sees the ancestor of man and believes that at this early time when man first entered Europe with one of the late migrations the racial differentiation was already established. lie bases this opinion on the observation that the chimpanzee and other apes show considerable variations in color of skin.</p><p>
Ilalfdan Bryn J2 assumes three fundamental racial groups none of which can be derived from any one of the others but all of which go back to a human (or subhuman) ancestor of Tertiary time. The earliest, he thinks, are a number of pygmy races, each developing its own type after isolation. From these developed the lower races. Finally the higher races developed in Asia from an ancient uniform type before the rise of the Himalayas and the other chains of mountains and plateaus which brought about isolation and divergent development in each area.</p><p>
Another highly speculative system is that of T. G. Taylor, who assumes that the most primitive races must be found in the marginal areas of the continuous land mass. Consequently he assumes the Tasmanians, Bushmen, Eskimo, and the people of the southern parts of South America as the earliest types which w r ere driven back by more and more highly developed races spreading eastward from central Asia.</p><p>
Other attempts to account for the origin of races have been made on the basis of morphological characteristics. Gustav Fritsch distinguished three fundamental races and derived from these meta-morph or mixed races. Similar ideas were developed by C. II. Stratz and H. Klaatsch, who considered the Australians as representatives of the earliest surviving stage of human development from which the Negroid, Mongoloid, and European races developed by differentiation. In he had changed his opinion and advocated a polygenetic origin of the races of man. He tried to prove that gorilla, Neanderthal man, and Negro, on the one hand; and orang, European, Malay, Australian, and Mongol, on the other, go back to two separate anthropoid branches. Still other Negro types are associated with the chimpanzee. These views can hardly be maintained.</p><p>
Racial physiology and psychology. The anatomical characteristics of an adult individual may be described with an accuracy that depends solely upon the refinement of measurement. They remain almost the same for a number of years. This is true at least for the skeleton, although the size of muscles, the amount of fat, of water contained in the tissues, and consequently weight, may undergo considerable fluctuations. Examples of dependence of form upon function are, for instance, found in the hand. Those of the blacksmith, clerk, and violin virtuoso differ on account of the development of the groups of muscles and their lesser or greater independence in use. Still, under the same conditions and for a reasonable length of time the forms and dimensions of the body are fairly stable.</p><p>
Not so with bodily functions. These are much more subject to fluctuations. Attempts to obtain basal values for any physiological function, like heart beat, blood pressure, metabolism, require the most painstaking observance of physiological conditions, and even when all precautions are taken they fluctuate more or less. There is no one value for one individual, but each individual has his own value which is variable and changes from moment to moment according to the conditions of life. For this reason the mode of life</p><p>
and the environmental conditions are infinitely more strongly reflected in physiological function than in anatomical form. An individual who leads an inactive life will change his physiological behavior when he is compelled to assume a life of continued strenuous exertion. It follows that people of the same descent who live in different environments and pursue types of occupation that are diverse in their influence upon the body will also differ in their physiological functions. Thus it happens that genetic differences are easily overlaid by environmental influences.</p><p>
For this reason the results of racial studies of physiological functions are often contradictory, and the contrasts between occupational groups in the same population are often much greater than the contrasts between racial groups. It also happens that groups of distinct genetic descent but living under the same environmental conditions function alike. In a few cases the influence of environment may increase the differences in type â€” for instance, in the effect of sunburn, which emphasizes the difference in pigmentation between very light and more strongly pigmented types, the former becoming reddish, the latter turning dark. Similar differences occur in reaction to epidemics against which one group has acquired partial immunity while another one has never been exposed.</p><p>
The influence of environment upon physiological function may be observed in the reaction of the body to high altitude. The rarefied air and the lesser amount of oxygen supply secured by each breath require a readjustment on account of the demands upon the respiratory system. The exhausting influence of hot and humid weather in summer as against the bracing clear winter air is well known. The same individuals exposed to different climatic environment exhibit material changes in their physiological behavior.</p><p>
Social conditions have a similar effect. The physiological functions of an undernourished, overworked individual differ from those of a well-nourished person whose bodily strength is not overtaxed. The Bushman and the South Sea Islander represent such a contrast, and it is not possible to determine how far the differences between their physiological reactions may be due to their descent, how far to environmental causes. Even their bodily forms must be in part an expression of the influence of these conditions upon their bodies during the period of growth.</p><p>
The variability <ef mental reactions of the individual is also strongly affected by environmental causes. Even simple psychophysical phenomena depend upon the closeness of attention paid to the stimuli. Reaction time, acuteness of hearing and sight, and other sense impressions are subject to modifications. Not even the maximum or minimum values obtained with the greatest possible precautions intended to secure uniform conditions under which the tests are made remain the same at all times, and their variability is not the same in all individuals. While some react with a fair degree of constancy, others are quite variable. More complex mental reactions are even less constant. Everyday observation proves the variability of emotional tone. The influence of fatigue and rest upon mental reactions is well known and has been the subject of many observations, particularly on school children. On account of the variability of mental traits under varying conditions, it is difficult to determine how far they are genetically or environmentally determined. There is no doubt that for each individual there exists a certain biological, genetically determined basis of mental behavior. If we had no other evidence, the contrasts between the mental behavior of the extremes, between the idiot and the genius, would be sufficient proof; but we have also every reason to believe that the differences between mentally stable and unstable, between artist and logical thinker, if not organically determined, are at least so influenced.</p><p>
The actual problem lies in the differentiation between the two sources of mental behavior, the organic and the environmental. Two methods are open for this inquiry. On the one hand the same individual, or individuals organically identical, may be investigated under different conditions; or individuals of distinct genetic descent may be studied under the same environment. Observations on the mental behavior of the same individual are not easily made, because time must elapse before mental habits change. For this reason the behavior of identical twins â€” that is, of twins originated from a single ovum â€” has received particular attention. Cases in which identical twins are brought up under different conditions since the time of birth are very rare, and since we do not know the length of the period required for the establishment of habits, a considerable amount of doubt is involved in the results of the few available cases. On the whole, identical twins seem to show a higher degree of similarity of behavior than dizygotic twins. The difficulties of interpretation of these observations have been set forth by Lancelot Hogben.</p><p>
Environmental determination of mental behavior is clearer in the study of larger groups than in the study of individuals, because sharper contrasts in social and cultural background are found in groups of similar descent than among individuals of the same group. The cultural changes among North American Indians due to the intrusion of modern civilization have brought about fundamental changes in behavior even among Indians of pure descent.</p><p>
Quantitative studies based on various kinds of tests also show that a population of the same descent changes its reactions according to changes in its environment. Thus Otto Klineberg has shown that Negro children transferred from rural districts to cities improve in the formal intelligence tests given to them in such a manner that those who have lived in the city longest approach other city children in their performance, while those newly arrived are decidedly inferior. Similar observations have been made in regard to Italian immigrants in North America.</p><p>
If a decided difference existed between types like those inhabiting Europe and living under the same social conditions it ought to show when a socially homogeneous group is classified according to anthropological form. No such proof is available. On the contrary, Karl Pearson's investigation of Europeans in regard to a possible correlation between bodily form and mental characteristics has given negative results.</p><p>
As in the state of bodily form we recognized the existence of many distinct genetic lines in each population and the occurrence of similar lines in related populations, so we find the same degree of variability in physiological and mental functioning and the same kind of overlapping, but added to these dependence upon environmental conditions, both geographical and social, that obscures the biological determinants of behavior.</p><p>
If in closely related populations it is impossible to speak of racial heredity, this is still more the case in regard to physiological and mental functions.</p><p>
No proof has been given that the distribution of genetic elements, that may determine personality is identical in different races. It is probable that limited differences of this kind exist, provided the differences between races are sufficiently fundamental. The differences which occur within each race are, however, equally important. The study of cultural forms in relation to the distribution of bodily types makes it more than probable that the racial differences, particularly in closely related forms, are irrelevant when compared with</p><p>
the powerful influence of the cultural environment in which the group lives. The behavior of the whole group conforms to its cultural standards to which each individual reacts in his own way.</p><p>
The frequently made assumption that bodily build and mental behavior are closely related is based on the observation of the characteristic distribution of types and cultures, both of which occur in locally circumscribed areas, so that each region is characterized by a somewhat unique type and culture. In modern society similar conditions prevail among social classes. This locally determined correlation is taken without further proof as evidence of a causal relation although the two phenomena are subject to entirely distinct influences, the one to purely biological, the other perhaps to a slight extent to biological, but much more to cultural conditions. The inference that the correlation between bodily form and culture is due to the dependence of the latter upon the former would require the proof that, without regard to cultural environment and to location, the same type must always produce the same mental characteristics.</p><p>
Eugenics. Experience gained in raising breeds of domesticated animals has shown that it is possible to produce stable varieties that fulfill certain requirements, like the production of an ample milk supply in cows or speed in horses. Theoretically it would be possible to breed also societies of men of definite qualities. While this ideal is held only by a few extremists, the thought that the quality of a population can be improved by encouraging the mating and fertility of healthy individuals and the gradual elimination of the unfit holds wide sway. The efficacy of such means is limited. The theory presupposes that certain stigmata are always hereditary and spring up independently either not at all or with extreme rarity. It lies in the nature of the case that families in which a hereditary disease exists can be found; while the negative evidence, that among the relatives of a person so affected no others affected are discovered, is not convincing. The assumption that such diseases do not spring up independently would lead to the absurd assumption that there must have existed one pathological and one normal race which intermingled, the ratio of the two depending upon the frequency of occurrence of the disease. A considerable number of hereditary diseases are assumed to be recessive according to the simplest Mendelian rules. If these did not originate spontaneously over and over again, we should have to assume such a large number of intermarrying pathological types that no healthy type could have existed among our progenitors.</p><p>
It can also be shown by a simple statistical consideration that the effect of excluding the hereditarily affected individuals from propagation would reduce their relative number so slowly that many generations would pass before any effect could be felt. If conditions of life are of a low standard we may safely assume that the number of those eliminated would be filled largely by those spontaneously developing new deficiencies. The problem involved is the determination of the causes that lead to the spontaneous development of hereditary diseases. Are these dependent upon more or less favorable social conditions, or what other factors may be at work in forming pathological mutations? True eugenic measures relating to hereditary diseases can be taken only when these questions have been answered.</p><p>
The question is quite different in those cases in which studies of heredity prove beyond cavil that a certain percentage of the offspring of a couple must be imbeciles or affected by incurable diseases which make them a burden to themselves, to their families, and to the community. What is to be done in those cases is a question of social ethics, not of anthropological inquiry. Anthropology can determine the effect of their presence upon the constitution and certain aspects of the functioning of society. It can be shown that individual suffering may be eliminated; but the general distribution of pathological forms in the population will not be greatly modified. The prevailing cultural ideals will decide what is to be done.</p><p>

CHAPTER IV</p><p>
LANGUAGE FRANZ BOAS</p><p>
General characteristics of language. Language, in the widest sense of the term, embraces the means by which the sensory, emotional, and volitional experiences of an individual are expressed and conveyed to others. Body movements, touch, and sound, conveying visual, tactile, and auditory impressions, may be used for this purpose.</p><p>
Communication between animals. Animals convey their emotions by means of cries, touch, and visible movements, and in so far as these are related to experiences exciting fear, anger, or pleasure they are significant. The cry of the leader of a herd serves as a warning of approaching danger. The display of the plumage of the male bird affects the female. The touch of the antennae of an ant conveys a message upon which its comrade reacts. Some animals have a considerable number of distinct cries with which they react to different emotional states or by which they call their fellows. The grimaces of the monkey indicate the nature of its mental excitement.</p><p>
In so far as a specific bodily reaction is related to similar sense experiences, it will excite in other animals of the same group, but not necessarily of the same species, the memory of similar situations, of an emotional rather than of a specific descriptive character. The range of experiences is very wide. The animal cry may convey the memory of danger and flight, of food and satiation of hunger, but nothing more definite. No case has been observed in which an animal represents a specific experience by visual, tactile, or auditory signs.</p><p>
Certain movements of the body or changes in posture of animals are also indicative of situations that may be understood by other individuals. The direction of the gaze toward an object that excites interest, the rigid position of the body in close attention, the movements when a scent is taken, the erection of the hair in excitement, the wagging of the tail of dogs when in a pleasant mood, are cer-</p><p>
tainly understood by other individuals who react to similar stimuli in the same manner. Movements of one individual solicit definite reactions in others. Here belong particularly the behavior of the male that intends to attract the attention of the female, such as the exhibition of the feathers in birds, and those movements that may be well described as dance; also the movements of animals, particularly of young ones, who invite others to play.</p><p>
Man uses movements and sound in the same manner, but in addition to vague expressions there are others by means of which specific experiences are indicated. Both animal and man turn their heads in the direction of an object exciting their attention, but in addition to this, man has the free use of his hands, which point and follow the movement of the object. Emotional attitudes are accompanied by inncrvations corresponding to actions. When the stimulus is strong enough these follow, but when weak they lead only to expressive movements, such as a call, shrinking away from some object, or a hostile repulsion.</p><p>
With the clearer differentiation of situations, these movements have multiplied and led to a gesture language which in its primitive form presumably consisted solely of intensified innervations but which has developed everywhere in such a manner that it accompanies articulate speech. We cannot tell whether gesture language preceded speech or developed with it. In its simpler forms it consists of movements which correspond to the weak innervation accompanying thought and speech. For the development of both gesture language and speech it was necessary that man should have acquired the ability to express specific experiences. To make this possible the number of significant symbols must have increased enormously. The situations that present themselves in the course of life are so varied that differentiation never proceeded to such a degree that each experience was expressed by means of a single acoustic or visual symbol, except in cases in which the same situation, distinct from all others, presented itself with great frequency. In fact such differentiation would be impossible on account of the uniqueness of every experience. In gestures as well as in spoken language large numbers of situations are expressed by the same formal expression. In other words, a grouping together of similar experiences persisted, and these have found their representation in symbols. Thus dog, water, running, sleeping, expressed either by gestures or by sound, include each large numbers of varied experiences, all understood under a single vague symbol. Other aspects of the same experiences may be expressed in similar ways. By means of the combination of these symbols, the whole situation is described from various angles and is thus communicated.</p><p>
It may be presumed that the possibility of calling attention to specific situations acted as a stimulus to further developments of communication by both gestures and sound. In many cases speed of communication must have been desired. Gesture presents the advantage that by pictorial movements a whole situation may be described at once, and it is still used when spoken language is not understood, as in the intercourse between individuals speaking different languages, or in the natural sign language of deaf mutes. It has the disadvantage that it must be seen and is therefore useless in darkness and in many other situations. Articulate sound has its precedents in the sounds uttered by animals. Its symbolic significance is not so apparent as that of imitative gesture, but must have developed from the significant signal. Articulate sound has proved so much more flexible than gesture that the latter is used only exceptionally as a means of communication, but occurs commonly accompanying speech.</p><p>
Gestures and cries like those of animals still survive. They are immediate reactions to situations replete with emotion, like cries of pain, pleasure, anger, or fear. These lack the specific connotation of speech, even if the symbols themselves are derived from specific words. Here belong interjections like ouch! on the one hand, and heavens! on the other.</p><p>
Categories of classification. The number of words â€” that is, of groups of sound symbols â€” used in any one language for various aspects of experiences cannot be unlimited. Recognition of a new situation implies that part of it is experienced as sufficiently similar to a previous sense impression, so that it merges with it. Many of the different forms in which water appears are combined in the same category and expressed by the same word. If a specific experience is to be communicated these wide categories must be specified and so limited that they apply to the particular situation. This is done by supplementing them by other categories. When I say, "The dog is barking," I do not add a new idea to the concept dog, but I express my single sense perception by denoting distinct aspects of my experience by means of a number of words sufficiently exhaustive to convey to the hearer its contents.</p><p>
In other words, in language the experience to be communicated is classified from a number of distinct aspects, each expressed by certain groups of phonetic units or words. This implies that these units must be coordinated according to some system in order to express the way in which they are related. "The man killed the bull" and "The bull killed the man" exemplify the importance of the way in which the elements are put into relation.</p><p>
These considerations show that every language must have a vocabulary, determined by the universe of experience, and the categories applied in its classification; and a grammar by means of which these elements are brought into relation. Language without both vocabulary and grammar is impossible. What is true of articulate language is equally true of gesture language. The single experience must be viewed from various points of view, and gestures expressing each aspect must be coordinated. Actually every spoken language has its vocabulary and its grammar, and every gesture language its signs and a rudimentary grammar in so far as the order of signs is significant. "The large dog bit me" would be expressed by signs as "Dog large bit me," or according to emphasis, "Me dog large bit."</p><p>
Phonetics. Articulate language is produced by action of the lungs, larynx, tongue, palate, lips, and the posterior nares. By these, sounds of short duration are produced, some retaining a constant character during their production, others changing in character. Each is clearly set off against its neighbor. Thus it becomes possible to recognize each sound as a unit. Stable sounds are the vowels of many languages, or consonants like t or s. Unstable sounds are gliding, diphthongized vowels and consonants like is or those with a gliding vocalic resonance. On account of the movability of the vocal cords and the organs of the oral cavity, particularly of the tongue, the number of sounds that can be produced is unlimited, although according to their acoustic qualities they may be combined in readily recognized groups, such as our vowels, and sounds similar to t, k, s, etc. Voluntary movements of the organs of articulation can be produced much more easily than those of any other part of the body. Complex combinations of positions producing various sounds can be produced with great rapidity. In slow speech a single sound requires hardly more than 0.07 of a second. Virtuosos may attain similar rapidity of movement by the successive use of fingers. The use of such rapidity of movement for conveying ideas</p><p>
is made possible by the sensitiveness of the ear, which can discriminate between sense impressions of shortest duration. Visual or tactile impressions could not be conveyed with equal rapidity because the momentary impressions would become blurred. Only with the development of reading has a means of communication been found that exceeds in rapidity the spoken word.</p><p>
Selection of material wed for expression. Articulate sounds, w r hile physiologically unlimited in number, can be recognized only when the number of those habitually produced in speech is limited. Single sounds or assemblies of sounds seldom repeated would not impress themselves upon the memory. Furthermore, the rapidity of utterance is tied up with the automatic repetition of the same movements. Thus it becomes intelligible that each language employs a limited number of sounds, forming a system of phonemes. An unlimited number would make the language unpronounceable and unintelligible. </p><p>
The same may be said of words. An infinite number of words, one for each sense experience, would make language impossible, because the same experience is never repeated in an identical way. It has been pointed out that classification is unavoidable. The same dog in different positions or activities, or every individual dog as it appears at different times, is not designated, each by a specific word; rather, all kinds of dogs in all conditions and activities may be classed under one term.</p><p>
While a limitation of sounds and of words is a necessity for the formation of speech, there is no reason to suppose that the principles of selection of sounds and of classification of experience will be the same in all languages. As a matter of fact we find the most diverse principles used. Some languages use musical pitch as a means of discrimination. Length of vowels and consonants may differentiate the significance of sound complexes, or they may be irrelevant. Some languages do not use the lips for the production of sounds (as we do in our p, 6, m) ; others, like English, avoid the use of the soft palate. Sounds may be produced by the air streaming out from the lungs, or by air compressed in the mouth, or by air sucked into the mouth and rushing in through the opening lips or over an opening between tongue and roof of mouth.</p><p>
Equally varied are the classifications under which sense experience is grouped. It has been pointed out that the cries of animals do not signify a specific situation. It might therefore be supposed</p><p>
that in the beginnings of human speech an ever-increasing restriction of the significance of various articulate utterances occurred until finally each group of articulations attained a specific meaning. If this was the case, we might expect to find undifferentiated expressions in primitive languages. This is true to a certain extent, for in languages in which the etymological processes are still transparent, many terms are formed by combining several elements of general significance which limit one another. Such generalized elements may be considered as early forms of linguistic expression. Still, it would be far from justifiable to claim that these languages represent an early state of human speech. Their present form is a result of a long historical growth no less than is the present form of our own language.</p><p>
A few examples of generalized terms may be given. The Sioux (Dakota) Indian has no special terms for to break, to tear, to cut up, to bite to pieces, but he derives all these from a general term meaning "to be severed." The Ilaida Indian uses a few verb stems of very general significance which are specialized by addition of other elements. The categories by means of which specialization is accomplished differ considerably. The Sioux uses elements expressing instrumentality. lie says for our to break, "to sever by pressure"; for to tear, "to sever by pulling"; for to cut up, "to sever by cutting." In all of these the term "to sever" is very general. The Ilaida uses in addition to instrumentality elements limiting the form of the object acted upon. Instead of saying "lie tears it," meaning a string, he has to say "By pulling a stringy object he severs it," thus limiting the general term "to tear" in two ways. It is important to note that these limiting terms are obligatory. 5</p><p>
The meaning of nouns which arc not derived from verbs is likely to be much more specific than that of verbs, although stems occur which might almost be called empty of all specific significance. These attain their meaning only by the addition of specializing elements. It is as though we were to qualify the term "thing" by new elements: "a thing that is a so and so." Proper names and names of important objects may well have been specific in very early times.</p><p>
We have reason to believe that these generalized concepts are not late developments from earlier, more specific meanings â€” a process of common occurrence in the history of language â€” but that we are dealing here w r ith a fundamental characteristic of early language.</p><p>
Generalized terms are not by any means the rule. On the contrary, large numbers of ancient elements are found that have very specific meanings. This is true of objects that are of cultural importance in many ways and for many purposes. In the life of the Eskimo snow means something entirely different as falling snow, soft snow on the ground, drifting snow or snowdrift. Fresh water ice, salt water ice, an iceberg, play quite different roles in their life and all these are designated by distinctive terms. As the horse-breeder has many terms for the horse, according to age, sex, coat color, and gait, so has the Chukchee a wide array of designations for the reindeer. In many cases in which the specific functions of the object in the life of the people are quite distinct, a general term is missing.</p><p>
In words expressing states or actions nice distinctions are often made in regard to form or consistency of the objects referred to. To throw may be expressed differently according to the form of the object thrown, as long, round, or flat, solid or fluid. We differentiate in this manner the verbs expressing existence at a place: a tree stands, a river runs, a log lies. In Dakota the word corresponding to to break is differentiated according to the hardness, softness, presence of grain, and other qualities of the material broken.</p><p>
Thus it appears that, while undifferentiated expressions exist, which may be on the line of development from animal cries, the languages of our period contain also elements of highly specific character the scope of which is determined by the traditional principles of classification and by the pressure of culture.</p><p>
The fundamentally different principles of classification employed by different languages may be illustrated by two examples, the numerals and terms of relationship. </p><p>
According to our language, units are arranged in groups of ten. We may call ten the higher unit of first order. Hundred would be the higher unit of second order. We are not quite consistent in our nomenclature, for the third higher unit ought to be one hundred times one hundred, our ten thousand. Many languages group by fives â€” that is, by the number of fingers and toes on each hand and foot â€” and call twenty "one man." Eighteen would therefore be "three on the other foot/' and seventy-two would be "three men (3 X 20) and two on the one foot (12)." The difficulty of translation appears still more clearly in high numbers. The number is for us five higher units of third order (5000) plus seven higher units of second order (700) plus two higher units of first order (20) plus nine. In the five-twenty (quinary-vigesimal) system it would be X (four-on-the-one-foot higher units of second order) plus X (one-on-the-other-hand higher units of first order) plus (four-on-the-other-hand), or [(2 X + 4) X 400] + [(5 + 1) X 20] + (5 + 4), or X = 5600, X = 120, + = 9; total 5729. The grouping of units is quite different from our own, and the expression of any higher number in one system requires a regrouping according to new principles that can be made only by arithmetical analysis.</p><p>
Perhaps still more striking are the systems based on other higher units â€” for instance, four, so that the count would be: one, two, three, higher unit of first order, which we render by the symbol 10. The higher unit of second order, which we render by the symbol 100, would be four times four, our sixteen. If we were to write the numerals of such a language according to our system they would run 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33, and so on; and our 3X3 = would be X = 21. Our arithmetic is based on a decadic system, theirs on a quaternary system.</p><p>
Analogous observations may be made in regard to terms of relationship. We classify our nearest relatives according to generation, sex, and line of descent (as direct or collateral). Consequently we have the terms father, mother, uncle, aunt; brother, sister, cousin; son, daughter, nephew, niece. The term cousin does not quite follow the general rule, since in it sex is disregarded. The principles used in other languages may be quite different. The paternal and maternal line may be distinguished, and relative age in the same generation may be expressed. When these are added to our system we have four terms for uncle and aunt. Two of these determine paternal or maternal line (like Latin patruus and avunculus); and two express whether uncle or aunt is older or younger than father or mother. Our reciprocal terms brother and sister for siblings (that is, children of the same parents) of equal sex will be subdivided into double terms, elder and younger brother or sister. Conversely, when no distinction is made between direct and collateral lines of descent the terms for father and father's brother, mother and mother's sister, brother or sister and cousin, son or daughter and nephew or niece, will coincide. An attempt to find the correct term for each relative according to strange systems brings out clearly the fundamental differences of classification and the difficulties encountered in translating one into the other.</p><p>
Sound symbolism. A special class of words are those expressing a sense experience by imitation of the sounds associated with it. Names of birds like cuckoo or chickadee in English imitate the calls of the birds. It is natural that the sound picture should not be accurate. It depends to a great extent upon the sounds employed by the language as well as upon other sound associations. Thus the Navajo imitate the cry of the whippoorwill by mncii, iciu r u\ wfiwu wiu'w; that of the chickadee by chi'shi chishi bebe. The Chinook Indians render the cry of the blue jay by k'esk'es, the Tsimshian by gus gm. In other cases the sound picture is immediately intelligible to us, as hehc, "to laugh/' hoho, "to cough," liumm, "to smell" of Chinook, an American Indian language spoken at the mouth of the Columbia River. In this language as well as in many Bantu dialects the formation of new words by sound imitation is a very live process.</p><p>
The relation between sound and concept is sometimes of a more remote nature. Most of us will feel that a high pitch and exaggerate length, perhaps also the vowel i (English ee), indicate smallness, while low pitch and length and the vowels a, o, u (English oo) indicate large size. It is not by any means certain that the same impressions are conveyed in all languages, but similar phenomena are not rare. Large or small size, or intensity, may be expressed by variations of sound. Thus Nez Perce, an Indian language spoken in Idaho, changes n to I to indicate smallness; Dakota has many words in which s changes to sh, or z to./, indicating greater intensity. In Chukchee, variations in meaning arc brought about by a change from / to ch. Undoubtedly the particular kind of synesthesia between sound, sight, and touch has played its role in the growth of language. 11</p><p>
Grammar. It has been pointed out that grammar determines the relationship between the various words expressing different aspects of an experience; but grammar performs another important function. It determines those aspects of each experience that mmt be expressed. When we say, "The man killed the bull," we understand that a definite single man in the past killed a definite single bull. We cannot express this experience in such a way that we remain in doubt whether a definite or indefinite person or bull, one or more persons or bulls, the present or past time, are meant. We have to choose between these aspects, and one or the other must be chosen. These obligatory aspects are expressed by means of grammatical devices. The aspects chosen in different groups of languages vary fundamentally. To give an example: while for us definiteness, number, and time are obligatory aspects, we find in another language location near the speaker or somewhere else, source of information â€” whether seen, heard, or inferred â€” as obligatory aspects. Instead of saying "The man killed the bull/' I should have to say, "This man (or men) kill (indefinite tense) as seen by me that bull (or bulls)/' In some languages the aspects that must be expressed are very numerous, in others very few. When I say in English, "The sheep ate grass," the otherwise obligatory aspect of number is obscured, although the situation or the context may make clear whether one or more sheep are meant. This shows that paucity of obligatory aspects does not by any means imply obscurity of speech. When necessary, clarity can be obtained by adding explanatory words. Thus the vague "The sheep ate grass" can easily be specified by saying "My herd of sheep ate the grass on my neighbor's meadow."</p><p>
While these obligatory categories vary in different languages, the relational functions of grammar have certain principles in common all over the world. Here belong, for instance, the relation between subject and predicate, noun and attribute, verb and adverb, and the relation of the experience to the speaker (the self) and to others â€” that is, the relations expressed by the pronouns 7, you, and he. The methods by means of which these and other relations are expressed vary very much, but they arc necessary elements of every grammar.</p><p>
Grammatical processes. While the vocabulary consists of many independent units, grammar employs a small number of devices for handling these units: by varying their position, combining them, adding elements that have no independent existence, or by modifying their structure. In the phrase, "The men killed the rattlesnake," the functions of men and rattlesnake as subject and object are indicated by position; the addition of'-ed to kill expresses past time; the change o*' man to men indicates plurality; and the composition of rattle and snake specifies the kind of snake referred to.</p><p>
A few languages employ only position to indicate grammatical relations. Others make an extended use of composition, in which process the component elements may undergo considerable modifications; or they use subordinate elements (affixes) at the end (suffixes) or at the beginning (prefixes) or even in the middle (infixes) of words. The inner changes are varied. We have not only vocalic changes like the one mentioned before, or as in see and saw, write and wrote.</p><p>
but also consonantic changes, as teeth and to teethe. In other languages many kinds of changes occur: changes in pitch, extensions arid contractions, duplication or reduplication â€” that is, partial duplication which extends over longer or shorter parts of the word and affects beginning, middle, or end of the word.</p><p>
Owing to the close contact between the elements of a phrase that expresses the various aspects of an experience, purely mechanical modifications of the single elements may occur, such as in English the change from in-possible to impossible. In many languages such changes are much more important. They may be contact phenomena, like the one just referred to, or extend their influence forward or backward over the word. To this group belongs the vocalic harmony of languages like Ural-Altaic, Chukchee, and Nez Perce, which require a series of related vowels in the whole word or, at least, in part of the word.</p><p>
History of languages. Languages are not stable. The sounds, meanings, and grammatical forms arc changing. In times of cultural upheaval, particularly when due to intimate contact between peoples of different speech, linguistic changes may be very rapid. In times of cultural stability the changes may be slow. The claim frequently made that unwritten languages change rapidly cannot be maintained. The isolated Eskimo dialects of Greenland and of the Mackenzie River, notwithstanding their long separation, do riot differ much. The Nahua of Mexico of the sixteenth century has undergone almost solely those changes that are due to changes in cultural life while the sounds have remained stable. Most of the Bantu dialects, notwithstanding their wide dispersion, have not undergone very fundamental changes. On the other hand, languages like the Indo-European, or in America the Siouan or Salishan languages, must have changed at times with great rapidity.</p><p>
The change of sounds is to a great extent due to mechanical processes. Some of these, dependent upon the mutual influences of sounds and characteristic of language as spoken at a given time, have been mentioned before. Besides these there are historical changes. In the course of decades and centuries sounds are modified in varied ways. The modern dropping of the r in English dialects in words like hard or bird, and the local Spanish change from terminal s to h, are examples.</p><p>
Some of these changes occur in many languages independently, such as the change from k to s or ch (pronounced as in English)</p><p>
which occurs particularly before the vowels e and ?' (continental pronunciation) in Indo-European, in the African Bantu and in the American Dakota, Salish, and Nootka. By contrast to this movement forward or palatalization of k, a movement backward or gutteralization of vowels anticipating later gutteral consonants may be observed in Eskimo (according to Thalbitzer). 12</p><p>
Vowels as well as consonants undergo such changes. It may be observed that words and grammatical forms tend to be worn down and that unaccented syllables are liable to suffer rapid decay. The soundshifts that develop in course of time are often so far-reaching that only an intimate knowledge makes it possible to recognize the ancient forms from which words in related languages have sprung.</p><p>
Meanings are even more unstable than sounds. Every change in details of culture gives to old words a new significance, and in closely related languages the course of development may be quite distinct. English knight and German Knecht (entailed servant), English knave and German Knabe (boy), may serve as examples. In similar manner the meanings of words change in the historical development of every language by extension or restriction of meaning, by analogy and metaphor.</p><p>
Grammatical forms are no more stable than sounds and meanings of words. The forms suffer phonetic decay; they are shifted by analogy to word classes to which they do not belong by origin; old forms are lost or new ones may sometimes be added.</p><p>
Linguistic families. This gradual differentiation of speech enables us to trace the early affiliations of modern languages. If the actual historical development of the Romance languages were unknown, it would be at once apparent that all must have sprung from the same root. Vocabulary and grammatical forms are so much alike that the common origin of all the languages of this group could not be doubted. More thorough comparison and a knowledge of the gradual shifting of sounds, meanings, and grammatical forms have proved in an analogous way that most of the languages of Europe and some of those of western and southern Asia are related and must have had an early historical connection. While it is impossible to reconstruct the ancestral language from which they have sprung, many of the original word forms can be reconstructed with a high degree of probability. For this reason the study of languages is a most important means of reconstructing the early history of mankind so far as it is reflected in language. Obviously the conditions under which bodily types on the one hand and languages on the other change are quite distinct. For this reason we may not expect to discover a history of races by a study of the history of languages.</p><p>
In many cases the study of languages gives us information in regard to early events in the history of man, much more precise than the study of bodily form; for it is difficult to give exact criteria of bodily form applicable to all individuals constituting a population, while distinct languages are sharply set off from one another. The numerous steins and grammatical forms are independent units and the common occurrence of any considerable number of these in distinct languages is incontestable proof of historical relation. Thus the proof that a language of Madagascar is related to Malay is sufficient proof of its historical connection with southeastern Asia; the occurrence of Athapascan speech in Alaska and in the Rio Grande basin proves that there must have been historical relations between these two districts.</p><p>
The problem of a genetic relationship between languages can be solved up to certain limits. When the similarities between languages are remote, difficulties present themselves that are not easily overcome.</p><p>
Mixed languages. Tt is well known that languages are apt to borrow words from one another. Modern English contains many foreign loan words: canoe, tobacco, chocolate are words belonging by origin to American Indian languages; alcohol, algebra are Arabic; boomerang is Australian; taboo, Polynesian. The kinds of words that are borrowed do not always belong to the same categories. European languages borrow principally nouns and verbs; seldom numerals, prepositions, and conjunctions. Modern Kwakiutl has borrowed a Nootka numeral (both languages spoken on Vancouver Island). Modern Nahua (Mexican) has taken over, besides nouns and verbs, Spanish conjunctions and prepositions. This is due to the breakdown of the old syntax of the language and adaptation to Spanish syntax.</p><p>
Languages with clear etymology, and capable of forming new compounds with ease, are not apt to borrow words, because they readily form descriptive words. In Kwakiutl a steamer is called "moving on the water with fire on its back'*; the telegraph, "talk along a line"; the radio, "talk through the air." Still, some words like tea, coffee, priest (laplete from Chinook jargon for le pretre) have been adopted. Some loan words will probably be found in all languages w r hen close cultural contact between neighbors of distinct speech occurs.</p><p>
Often these loan words undergo changes according to the phonetic character of the language adopting them. Thus the language of the Tlingit of Alaska contains some loan words taken from their inland neighbors. Since Tlingit has no labials (/;, p, m) every m changes to w. Tillamook, a language of Oregon, has borrowed words beginning with p from the neighboring Chinook, but since it has no p it changes the sound according to its own phonetic rules to h. Other changes are due to assimilation to known words, as North German popular reincfiercn for the literary rcnovicren.</p><p>
What is true of words is also true of sounds. It is perhaps not easy to show by convincing historical examples that close contact between two languages, or superposition of one language over another, has led to considerable changes of phonetic systems. In modern Nahua the sound r has been introduced although foreign to the ancient form of speech. It occurs not only in loan words that are not subject to inflectional modification but also as part of steins in verb forms, like hablar, which are treated as though they were ancient Nahua stems. In many native American languages the effect of English schooling upon pronunciation may be observed, particularly in so far as the harsh, glottalized sounds lose in strength. Often the melody of the phrase is also modified.</p><p>
Furthermore the wide spread of phonetic phenomena which are characteristic of continuous areas in which languages of very distinctive structures are spoken can hardly be explained except as the result of mutual phonetic influences. As examples may be given the superabundance of velar sounds, produced by contact between the back of the tongue and the soft palate, in arctic and northwestern America and their absence in eastern America; the w r ide area over which harsh, glottalized sounds are extended, the occurrence of mixed vow r els in the Southwest and in California; the combined (affricative) sounds tl, dl and the voiceless / in the West; the clicks of South African Bantu languages which must be due to Bushman influence. The last of these are most convincing because true clicks do not occur in any other part of the world. They are produced by a strong sucking motion. Weaker sounds produced by drawing in breath occur in other parts of Africa and locally in one of the languages of California.</p><p>
If it is difficult to show historically the influence of the sound system of one language upon another, it is still more difficult to prove convincingly that extended morphological borrowing has taken</p><p>
place. Influences of the syntax of one language upon another are easily proved. The change of Nahua syntax under Spanish influence has been mentioned. Latin syntax has had its effect upon English. Borrowing of affixes that conform with existing categories is also common. Thus in European languages the Latin ex- has gained admission as ex-king; and -ieren is used in German not only to transfer foreign verbs into German (regieren, blamiereri) but occasionally also with German words (stolzieren, hofiereri). It is more interesting to note that Chinook, which has no nominal cases, has borrowed case (or locative) endings where it is in contact with Sahaptin, a language which uses case suffixes. In Kwakiutl, among part of the young generation who go to English schools, the category of the definite article has been introduced, being expressed by an ancient device. The category itself is quite alien to the older Kwakiutl speech.</p><p>
The strongest reason for assuming the occurrence of far-reaching morphological borrowing is found in the peculiar distribution of analogous categories or processes in languages of distinctive morphological types. These occur often in continuous territory, while outside of it the same categories or processes are not found; what is still more important, each trait has its own characteristic distribution distinct from that of other traits.</p><p>
As an example might be mentioned the distribution of the process of reduplication, which is absent in the extreme northern part of America and among the Iroquois, but common in a large area farther south.* More striking is the occurrence of consonantic changes to indicate the diminutive, which is characteristic of an area extending from northern California over Oregon, Washington, and Idaho; the use of sex gender in a number of quite distinct languages around Columbia River; the expression of the idea of instrumentality (action done with the hand, with a knife, etc.) on the Plateaus, in California, and on part of the Plains; the obligatory distinction of position by demonstrative pronominal elements on the coast of British Columbia; the similarity of verbal modes in Eskimo and Chukchee; the grammatical distinction between proper names and common nouns in Kwakiutl and in the neighboring Tsimshian. 15</p><p>
Independent origin of similar grammatical processes. It must also be remembered that a linguistic trait found in distinct languages is not always due to historical transmission but may develop independently. Sex gender occurs in Indo-European languages and on the Pacific coast of America; a dual in ancient European languages and in many isolated spots all over the world; instead of our plural we, we find the more logical distinction between "I and you" and "I and he" in disconnected languages. Numeral systems based on five are common; reduplication is often used for expressing plurality or repetition. In many of these cases historical connection is quite inconceivable. The phenomenon is analogous to parallel developments in groups of animals or plants that are genetically unrelated.</p><p>
It follows from all this that for many distantly related languages the history of which is unknown, a categorical answer in regard to their genetic relationship cannot be given. In many cases historical relation must be assumed, but whether we are dealing with mixture of languages or with divergent branches of an ancient stock will remain doubtful.</p><p>
Distribution of languages. At present we find a number of closely related languages occupying extended areas. Examples are the Indo-European or Aryan in Europe and Asia; Turkish languages and Chinese in Asia; Malay and related languages from Madagascar in the west across the Indian and Pacific Oceans to Hawaii and Easter Island in the east; Bantu in a large part of Africa; Algonquian in eastern North America and extending westward to the Mississippi River and beyond; Carib and Arawak in a large part of eastern South America. In contrast to these widely distributed groups of languages we find others, apparently unrelated, which are restricted to small areas, so that in a narrowly limited district many languages are found. Examples of such areas are California and the North Pacific coast as far as Alaska, the region around the Gulf of Mexico, including Central America; the foothills of the South American Andes; northeastern Asia extending from Japan northward over Siberia; the western Sudan.</p><p>
In many cases it is possible to show that groups of languages which occupy vast territories have only recently been spread so widely. Parts of Europe were inhabited by people of non-Aryan speech, and the Mediterranean area particularly was non-Aryan until a comparatively late period. There is good evidence to show that the Bantu spread over South Africa at a recent time. Turkish-speaking people established themselves in Asia Minor, southeastern</p><p>
Europe, and Siberia in historic times; Arabic was carried into Egypt and along the coast of North Africa after the time of Mahomet. Chinese has gradually extended its domain over a large area. The Malay-Polynesian migrations belong to recent times. In historic and presumably also in prehistoric times languages have disappeared in large numbers, but we do not know of a single example of the origin of an entirely new language with new vocabulary, new grammatical forms, and new categories. It seems plausible that in very early times the number of languages for which a genetic relationship cannot be established must have been much greater than it is now, and the areas of great linguistic differentiation, like the Sudan or the Pacific coast of America, presumably represent conditions such as existed in early times all over the world.</p><p>
The great differentiation here referred to must be understood to refer to languages for which the proof of a genetic relationship cannot be given. It does not touch upon the question of a single or multiple origin of groups of these languages. The occurrence of parallel developments in languages without historic relation makes it very improbable that all languages should have had a single origin.</p><p>
When we compare this picture with the diversity of human types it will be noticed that the number of early languages must have been much larger than the number of clearly distinct anatomical types. Some of these have also disappeared, but on the whole we find uniform types spread over areas much larger than those covered by languages. It follows from this that in an early period distinct languages must have been spoken by people of the same type, so that there must have been racial types which possessed or produced more than one of the early languages which in their present form can be proved to be derived from the same source. An identity of race and language may not be supposed even for the isolated bands that lived before intimate contact and the accompanying diffusion of languages occurred. It is probably true that in the earliest times possessors or originators of a language all belonged to the same racial type, but it is equally true that the possessors or originators of a number of different languages must have belonged to the same racial type.</p><p>
Thus it appears that language has behaved in the same way as all other cultural traits, for in early times, when mankind had spread all over the world, we find a great differentiation of culture according to locality. The history of culture has resulted in an increased leveling down of local differences in so far as certain cultures became dominant over larger areas and as mutual influences increased in number and intensity.</p><p>
Culture and speech. Much has been said in regard to the relation between speech and culture. It is true that in many languages it would be difficult to express the generalized statements of philosophic science, because the categories imposed by the structure of the grammar are too specific. It is not true that primitive languages are unable to form generalized concepts. We have given before (page 130) illustrations of wide generalizations which are used, although not necessarily conceived with any degree of clarity. There may be no term for tree, but there may be one signifying " the long thing standing." There may be no general term for seal, but one for "things that come up to breathe." On the whole the degree of specialization will depend upon cultural interests. Categories that are culturally unessential will not be found; those culturally important will be detailed. For us, paternal or maternal descent is culturally comparatively irrelevant, whereas generation is important. This is reflected in our terminology of relationship. In cultures in which the distinction between paternal and maternal lines is socially important, there will normally be a distinct terminology for them. When generation is irrelevant, this also may be disregarded in the terminology of relationship. In regard to all these matters language is exceedingly plastic and follows the demands of culture. Proof of this is found not only in our own language, but also in the modifications that so-called primitive languages undergo when the people become familiar with modern civilization and begin to participate in it. The vocabulary develops in conformity with the expanding or changing activities.</p><p>
It is not only the vocabulary that is so influenced. In primitive culture people speak only about actual experiences. They do not discuss what is virtue, good, evil, beauty; the demands of their daily life, like those of our uneducated classes, do not extend beyond the virtues shown on definite occasions by definite people, good or evil deeds of their fellow tribesmen, and the beauty of a man, a woman, or of an object. They do not talk about abstract ideas. The question is rather whether their language makes impossible the expression of abstract ideas. It is instructive to see that missionaries, who in their eagerness to convert natives have been compelled to learn their languages, have had to do violence to the idioms in order</p><p>
to convey to the natives their more or less abstract ideas, and that they have always found it possible to do so and to be understood. Devices to develop generalized ideas are probably always present and they are used as soon as the cultural needs compel the natives to form them.</p><p>
It is not unimportant to recognize that in primitive languages, here and there, our adjectival ideas are expressed by nouns. A poor person may be conceived rather as a person who has poverty; a sick person as a person who has sickness; and it is not necessary that these qualities should be conceived as concrete objects. Sickness is often so conceived, but poverty or size is not. We find also cases in which the structure of the sentence demands the frequent use of abstract nouns, as when the Kwakiutl Indian of Vancouver Island says to a girl, "Take care of your womanhood"; when the Eskimo speaks of smallness or largeness of an object; or when the Dakota Indian speaks of strength and goodness.</p><p>
In this sense it is not justifiable to consider languages as hindering or favoring cultural development. We should rather say that language is a reflection of the state of culture and follows in its development the demands of culture. In another way, however, language exerts an influence upon culture. Words and phrases are symbols of cultural attitudes and have the same kind of emotional appeal that is characteristic of other symbols. The name of a rite, of a deity, an honorific title, a term giving a succinct expression to political or church organization, may have the power to raise the passions of a people without much reference to the changing contents of the term. To us the words liberty and democracy have such an appeal, although the concept of liberty or of democracy may undergo such changes that they are no longer recognizable. The power of such phrases and symbols to excite masses to action or to stabilize existing institutions must not be underestimated. The cry of the Crusaders, "God wills it"; the halo surrounding the terms Emperor, King, and Queen; the inspiration given by national anthems, by the empty phrases of orators, are forces that mould culture. It would, however, be an error to assume that this is a purely linguistic phenomenon. It is rather an instance of symbolism and should be considered in that connection.</p><p>
While the details of linguistic structure are a field somewhat remote from other aspects of culture, their value for historical reconstruction is clear. We have seen how early migrations may be</p><p>
traced by linguistic evidence. Other cultural facts are reflected in language. Loan words may indicate particular types of cultural relations, as when a particular style of weaving or an implement is called by a foreign word. In European languages such etymological relations demonstrate events in cultural history. This is exemplified by the influence of Greek upon Latin, of Latin upon the modern European languages, and by the addition of a multitude of foreign words taken over by all European languages. More interesting are those linguistic reflections of cultural phenomena which express present or past conditions. We have referred before to the classification of terms of relationship. These represent aspects of behavior of members of a family to one another, though not necessarily those prevailing at the present time. They are indispensable for our understanding of social organization. Their definition gives us an insight into the present or past structure of the family. Lack of consistency in the system may indicate historical changes or present conflicts of attitudes. Similarly the clear definition of other terms may reveal cultural data. The terms generally translated as "soul" vary considerably in content, and an accurate definition of their scope is indispensable for the understanding of religious concepts. The same is true for the concept of the supernatural. The meaning of words like manitoo, wakanda, mana, and taboo, which are used in a generalized sense by investigators of religion, have their own peculiar connotations in each culture, and the attitudes of the individual tribes cannot be understood without a painstaking analysis of the ideas represented by the words used for expressing the varying aspects of the supernatural. A crude translation of native terms into approximately corresponding terms of English or of any other language and psychological interpretations built thereon are often the causes of serious misunderstandings. 18</p><p>
Linguistic usages, like metaphorical expressions or allusions in phrases, are also illuminating. When the natural functions of the body are expressed euphemistically by suggestive terms (like "to go out" instead of to defecate; "to be near" instead of to cohabit), light is thrown upon the attitude of the people to these functions. Likewise the euphemistic substitution of "to become weak" or "to go to the end," instead of to die; "to lie down" instead of to be sick, is suggestive of attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>
Allusions, as long as alive, are indicative of subjects that are generally present in the minds of the people; if formalized they</p><p>
show that in the past at least the ideas referred to were important to the people, as when we refer to the devil and witches. For example, Indians of the Northwest have an expression "Is this war, father?" which is a quotation from a tale and means that the person who quotes it is in great distress. Or the Dakota will say, " Did you not know that he had a striped palate?" referring to the mythical trickster who is said to have a palate of that kind. The saying means that the person referred to was known as a cheat. These allusions are most frequent in proverbs such as occur in great profusion in Africa.</p><p>
It is obvious that for the understanding of the form of native literature, if we may use this term for their unwritten poetry and tales, a thorough knowledge of the language is indispensable, for without it the elements that appeal to the esthetic sense of the hearer cannot be appreciated.</p><p>

CHAPTER VI</p><p>
INVENTION FRANZ BOAS</p><p>
Discovery and invention. Even in the simplest stages of culture man does not obtain his living without providing, no matter how inadequately, for future needs. He does not live without the help of some simple utensils, and nowhere is he without some kind of protection against the inclement weather and without some sort of ornament.</p><p>
Some of these achievements are shared by man and animals, particularly the habit of storing supplies and of providing artificial shelter. There is no reason to suppose that they originated in man in any way different from the manner in which they developed among animals. Among lower animals, particularly insects, these devices have most complicated forms, and examples are found even of an artificial control of food supply. 1</p><p>
But whatever the origin of these devices may have been, however much or little man's achievements may be due to his animal nature, the varied use of implements fashioned by human hands, the gradual changes in their form, the ever-increasing extent of modifications of products of nature, and the use of clothing set off man definitely from animals.</p><p>
The sources of these characteristically human traits may readily be observed since they continue to function even in our present stage of culture. Many are due to the observation of an unexpected phenomenon that challenges attention, or to the discovery that some object or some method of handling objects can be made to serve a desired end. Others are due to a conscious endeavor to find the means for achieving a purpose, such as the search for adequate materials or for methods of handling them. Often these are based on previous discoveries which are combined in new ways. In other cases they require the discovery of new materials and of new methods.</p><p>
Although we shall never be able to explain the ultimate sources of inventions, it seems more than plausible that in the early history</p><p>
of mankind discovery played a most important part and that the essential element was the recognition of the applicability to human needs of observed phenomena. The observation that a falling stone crushes things must have preceded the use of a stone as a hammer for breaking bones or nuts. How far a conscious recognition occurred in earliest times cannot be decided. In modern man we may observe both tendencies: the sudden recognition of the usefulness of some material, form, or activity, and the intensive search for means of reaching a desired end.</p><p>
Discoveries can be made only in the environment in which man is placed. Nature offers the opportunities of which man avails himself. Stone, wood, and shell are found to be useful materials; the branches of trees or caves offer shelter. Inventions or discoveries are based on the observation of the qualities and behavior of objects exhibited in the course of natural events or when handled by man.</p><p>
Fire and cooking. The discovery and the use of fire will illustrate the complexities of early achievements. Clear evidences of the use of fire are found as early as Pre-Mousterian times. It is difficult to say how much earlier its usefulness may have been discovered. Since the remains of fire were found in caves, it must have been carried there from the outside or been artificially started. It is not easy to understand how man was induced to domesticate fire, which must have appeared to him in nature as a terrifying phenomenon. Burning woods, grass fires, volcanic eruptions, are all of a kind to frighten man, not to attract him. It is impossible to tell whether the dead animals that were found scorched after a grass fire, the fish that were killed in hot or boiling water, attracted his attention and induced him to keep smoldering roots or rotting trees in order to start a new fire whenever he wished to do so, but some such reason must have induced him to preserve fire. It seems plausible that long before the art of fire-making was discovered, burning logs and roots were carefully preserved and means were found to preserve fire even when traveling about. Among many primitive people every village has its permanent fires which, when properly covered with soil or ashes, keep glowing for many weeks; and various kinds of slow matches that can be carried along are in common use.</p><p>
The step from preserving fire to starting a new fire is also difficult. The two essential methods of fire-making were by friction and by the strike-a-light. We must necessarily assume that some kind</p><p>
of experience must have preceded the invention of these devices. The most common form of the friction apparatus is the fire drill, an implement consisting of a wooden base, the "hearth," and the wooden drill which is rapidly rotated with some pressure. Generally the hearth has notches through which the wood dust produced by drilling falls upon tinder. Since in early industries there certainly was no drilling of wood in wood, it seems not unlikely that the fundamental experience was that wood dust was produced by friction and that this dust was known to be useful for rekindling the smoldering fire. Then it may have come to be known that the rapid turning motion produced plentiful wood dust, particularly when a little sand was put in the drilling hole, and accidentally the first spark may have been produced in this manner. Considerations of this kind suggest at least a possible way in which this fundamental invention may have been made. While the fire drill is well-nigh universal, the fire plow, a board in which a stick is rapidly pushed back and forward, is confined to islands of the Pacific Ocean. In this case also the production of wood dust is essential. The fire saw is used in Malaysia. It consists of a split bamboo which is sawed through so that the Fig. 40. The fire drill dust fa O p S down and is finally ignited by the (after Hough). heat produced by the rapid f riction .</p><p>
It is equally difficult to understand the origin of the strike-a-light. The observation may have been made that flint striking another hard stone, particularly pyrites, produced sparks; and since the art of procuring fire from an ember by adding appropriate tinder was known, the same experiment may have been made with the sparks obtained from the strike-a-light. At best all such assumptions cannot be more than guesses that can neither be proved nor disproved. All we can do is to try to reconstruct conditions that seem possible in the state of cultural development of these early times.</p><p>
Fire was presumably used at an early time for roasting food, either on spits by the side of the fire or in hot ashes. Much more difficult to explain is the origin of steaming and boiling. The conditions under which the effect of steaming may be observed are hardly ever realized in nature. Still we find almost everywhere the art of making underground ovens. Red-hot stones are placed in the bottom of a pit and covered with leaves or branches. The food to be steamed is placed on top, covered with a new layer of leaves, and finally closed with a layer of soil. Water is poured in, and the steam generated when the water reaches the red-hot stones is kept in long enough to cook the food.</p><p>
The discovery of boiling food is also difficult to understand. Boiling water is rarely observed. If occurring after a great conflagration, man would hardly approach it until after the water had ceased boiling. It may be seen when a stream of lava reaches a pond, or in geysers. Rare as these two experiences are, they may have been important elements in the invention of cooking, since the earliest method of cooking employs red-hot stones thrown into water. It is difficult to conceive how the use of fire could have led to the observation of boiling and to the experience that boiled food is palatable. Furthermore, all boiling requires vessels, and these would have had to be invented before the art of preparing food by boiling as practiced by the tribes of simplest culture could develop.</p><p>
Mechanical principles. The handling of materials acquainted man with a number of physical and chemical facts that found application in many inventions. The strength of the blow of the hand was increased by holding a hammerstone or a club which offered the added advantage of hardness of the striking object. The principle of the lever must have been discovered at an early time. It may be presumed that wherever heavy objects are moved the lever came into play. The heavy trees used in traps may have been moved by the cooperation of many hands without implements, but heavy posts and stones can hardly be raised without some mechanical help. Shore poles or other devices like inclined planes and levers were necessary for accomplishing these ends. The lever is used extensively in the construction of deadfalls in which it serves as a release. The South American Indians use it for bringing a strong pull to bear on elastic basketry tubes used for squeezing the juice out of pulp. The Eskimo use it for twisting the strands of sinews with which they back their bows. By being twisted the sinew strands are shortened and give the necessary elasticity to the bow.</p><p>
Torsion is also used in other ways to obtain strong pressure. In Samoa torsion is used for squeezing out the juice from shavings of the bark of Bischoffia jamnica, which is used for painting bark cloth (tapa). The shavings are placed in a bag-shaped mat ending in ropes. One end is suspended from the branch of a tree; the other has a loop through which a stick is passed, serving as a lever. By twisting the stick the mat bag is compressed. The striking part of certain traps used by the Eskimo, Chinese, and Egyptians is held by tautly twisted sinews or cords which when released snap back with great force, like the twisted cords used for spanning woodsaws. Knowledge of movements due to the disturbance of equilibrium is utilized in traps consisting of a pit or cage concealed by a cover which is so supported that it tips over as an animal steps on it and then reverts to its original position. Such knowledge is also implied in the game of seesaw.</p><p>
The resisting power of hard surfaces is made use of in shields and shelters.</p><p>
Rollers for moving heavy loads were used here and there, for instance by South American Indians in moving their canoes over portages. The Eskimo, whose mechanical genius is quite exceptional, even use pulleys for hauling ashore heavy sea mammals. </p><p>
Mechanical principles used in implements. Many mechanical devices are in use to increase the force with which a projectile is thrown. When man used for this purpose sticks held at one end, he must have discovered at an early time that those heavy at the far end flew farther and with deadlier aim than those of equal thickness. From this observation must have developed the numerous forms of throwing clubs with thin handles and a heavy knob at the end. Among African tribes this led to the invention of elaborate throwing knives which are hurled like clubs. </p><p>
The stick used for striking is made still more dangerous when the striking end has sharp edges or when a heavy sharp stone is inserted in the end. These fonns occur, for instance, in the tomahawk.</p><p>
Two other inventions are based on centrifugal force, the sling and the bola. By the rapid rotation of the sling and the sudden release of one end of the string the stone is given a much greater impetus than can be given by the hand alone. In the bola several small stones or other heavy objects are attached to strings which are swung around and thrown, and entangle the animal that is hit by them.</p><p>
A highly specialized form of throwing club, based more upon the cutting effect of striking sharp edges than upon the impact of the heavy end, is found in northeast Africa, southern India, and among the Pueblo Indians of North America. It is a flat carved board for throwing. In the Australian boomerang its wings are slightly twisted; this has the effect that the weapon, if. it misses its aim, rises and returns toward the place from which it was thrown.</p><p>
Increased initial velocity of the thrown lance is also secured by an artificial lengthening of the arm by means of a wooden implement, held in the hand, which ends in a peg or groove â€” an artificial hand that holds the end of the spear. This point, being farther removed from the shoulder, moves more rapidly and gives to the weapon an increased impetus.</p><p>
The throwing board is probably a very ancient invention. It is used, for instance, in Australia and by the Eskimo. It survives in Mexico. In some regions a loop made of cord is used in a similar manner. Instead of being attached at the far end of the missile, it is placed near the center of gravity, where it is loosely held by a notch.</p><p>
When wound around the shaft it gives a rotating motion to the weapon. Centrifugal force was also used in the rapidly revolving spindle whorl, in bull-roarers, and in tops.</p><p>
The effectiveness of a straight forward thrust of a stick depends upon the straight line and strength of the shaft and the sharpness and hardness of the point. An attack on large animals with an unhafted cleaver would have been an exceedingly hazardous undertaking. It became less dangerous when the point of a stick was hardened in fire and then sharpened, or a sharp stone or bone was attached to a straight shaft which made it possible to direct the thrust or throw with accuracy.</p><p>
The elasticity of wood was used in the invention of spring traps and of bow and arrow. The spring trap consists of a branch or sapling which is bent down and held insecurely by a holder. A noose is attached to the holder. In the' simpler form of these traps the animal which is caught in the noose loosens the holder by its efforts to free itself, so that the elastic sapling springs back and pulls it up. In more complicated forms there is a mechanism by which the animal steps on a stick which releases the sapling.</p><p>
It seems very likely that the invention of the spring trap and of the bow are somehow related, although the transition is not easily understood. The two have in common the use of the elasticity of wood and the taut strings, but the use of the latter for propulsion is foreign to the simple spring trap. More complex forms of the spring trap which make use of the arrow are undoubtedly late inventions. Bow and arrow were in use in late Paleolithic times, for rock paintings of this period represent hunters using them.</p><p>
The further development of the bow presupposes very specific knowledge of the materials that man was handling, for wherever elastic wood was not available complicated devices were used to increase the elasticity of the stave by combining materials of different elasticity. The wood or bone was backed with sinew, whalebone, or some kind of wood of different elasticity. The sinew was glued on or tied on in braids. All these methods are so complicated that they presuppose close observation based on experiences in handling materials. Playful handling may have played an important part in accumulating this knowledge. It is not unlikely that some of these inventions were made at one place and were gradually learned by neighboring tribes and thus spread over a wide area. The distribution of the compound bow favors such a theory.</p><p>
The development of the arrow proves also that it is based on experience in handling materials. The distribution of weight in point and shaft, the form of the notch and particularly the steadying of the flight of the arrow by means of feathering, flat or straight and varying in number of feathers, must be the results of experience in handling.</p><p>
The local absence of the bow and arrow in Australia is a curious anomaly because the invention goes back to Paleolithic times. It seems likely that among the Polynesians and Micronesians and a few African tribes, who otherwise have an advanced inventory of inventions, its use has been lost.</p><p>
An entirely different method of propulsion is used in the blowgun which is found among the Malays, Melanesians, and South American Indians. The light arrows are said to carry up to one hundred feet. Their effectiveness is due to the poison in which they are dipped.</p><p>
Both air pressure and suction are employed in the bellows of Asia and Africa.</p><p>
The effect of suction is used by the Bushmen for obtaining water. A hole made in the ground reaches down to the water table. A tube is inserted and the water is sucked up with the mouth and then squirted into ostrich eggs, the contents of which have been sucked out, and which serve as receptacles. The same principle is used in cupping, which is widely known in Africa and America.</p><p>
Friction is utilized in all forms of tying and joining. Diminution of friction plays an important role in transportation. Examples are the careful icing of sledge runners by the Eskimo, which allows the sledge to slide easily over the hard snow, and the rollers which are placed under canoes.</p><p>
Watertight and airtight materials are used for many purposes. Stone, wooden, and basketry vessels â€” the last-named sometimes made tight by a covering of pitch or clay â€” serve as containers of liquids. Intestines and bladders are used when airtight receptacles are needed. Hides are also prepared so as to become watertight and are employed both as clothing and as covers of canoe frames. Waterproof garments are also made of intestines.</p><p>
In hunting fish and sea mammals and in transportation the knowledge of the floating of objects of low specific gravity, and of the sinking of those of high, is utilized. Light wood and bladders filled with air are employed as floats holding up the tops of nets while the lower part is held down by sinkers. Floats are also attached to harpoon lines or shafts which prevent the escape of the game or the loss of the shaft. The light weight of wood is employed in rafts. The observation that hollow vessels placed on water are less deeply immersed than solid wood and are capable of carrying heavier weight is utilized in the making of canoes. Other types of canoes consist of frames covered with watertight skins. The canoe is anchored by means of a stone sinker.</p><p>
The mechanical knowledge displayed in canoeing is remarkable. Paddles are used like levers â€” one hand serving as fulcrum, the other as the moving force. The Eskimo use oars in their large boats and substitute a rowlock, consisting of two interlocking loops of thongs, for the fulcrum. In steering, a single paddler will turn his paddle so as to counterbalance the one-sided impetus that drives the canoe in one direction and to steer a straight course. The Eskimo uses instead of this the double-bladed paddle which propels his kayak first to one side, then to the other. When an equal number of paddlers are on each side, the steersman controls the direction of the canoe by turning the blade of his paddle or by paddling on one side or the other as conditions demand. Steadiness of the canoe is obtained by using ballast, in the South Seas by joining two canoes side by side but some distance apart, or by use of the outrigger. Sailing before the wind was known to the Eskimo and Northwest Coast Indians. The Micronesians and Polynesians sailed close to the wind and some of them had even learned to give to their canoes a slightly asymmetrical form in order to avoid leeward drift.</p><p>
The acoustic effect of beating and rasping strengthened by the resonance of a hollow space was utilized in drums and other instruments. Notched bones or sticks were pulled over the edges of resonance boxes, or an elastic stick was rubbed over a gourd provided with notches. In the friction drum, the drum was made to vibrate by means of a stick or string passed through a perforation in the center of the drumhead. The vibrations are produced either by passing the stick up and down or by rubbing it. The whizzing sound of rapidly moving objects is utilized in the bull-roarer and similar instruments. </p><p>
Compound implements. It seems likely that all the earliest implements used by man were objects that were made more handy by modification of natural forms. Stones, sticks, shells, and jaws may have been so used. It must have been a great step forward when two objects were combined to form one implement. Some of these modifications, like wrapping with skin or covering with pitch the part of a sharp-edged stone knife held in the hand, served merely as a protection making possible the employment of greater force. Moje important was the discovery of the usefulness of handles to tools for cutting, piercing, breaking, or scraping. This may have been suggested by stout sticks with an attached branch, with which a much stronger blow can be given than with the branch alone. It is not saying too much when we claim that the invention of the handle was a step as important as the discovery of the usefulness of a tool. One aspect of the advance of invention consists in the perfection of the handle. The difficulty of this step should not be underrated, and its importance was pointed out years ago by Daniel G. Brinton. There is no phenomenon in nature that would suggest the combination of different materials into a whole so as to form a handle. It may happen every now and then that a stone is inclosed in a root, but I doubt whether this is frequent enough to give the necessary stimulus. If the connection between handle and working part of the tool is not secure, it is useless. Therefore many additional experiences were required before an efficient handle could be made. In cutting tools the working edge must remain free. The handle end must be attached by being united securely with the handle. Archaeology does not give us information in regard to the earliest stages of this process, because the connecting material is necessarily perishable. From modern specimens we may infer that tying was one of the methods most frequently employed, but tying presupposes the invention of tying materials, thongs or strings. Tough stems or fibrous strips torn off from young trees may have furnished material, but the question remains: What suggested the idea of tying? May it be that the firm encirclement of stems or branches by winding plants gave the suggestion to use them for holding parts together? Or may it have been suggested by playing with strips, winding them around hand and fingers or around objects? However this may be, it is clear that a great step forward was taken when the art of tying two objects together had been learned. When the stone was to be used for clubbing animals, it might be entirely encased, and for this purpose a piece of skin wrapped around and twisted so as to form a handle would be adequate.</p><p>
Cement was also used at an early time to unite separate pieces. Blood and various kinds of pitch, sometimes mixed with beeswax or powdered stone, are used by American Indians as well as by Australians. Arrowheads were thus glued to shafts. Cements are used for calking canoes and wooden vessels. The Eskimo use a cement made of mixed blood and fat for joining the stone slabs forming the sides of a rectangular cooking pot to one another and to the bottom. The South American blowgun, which is made of two parts fitted neatly together, is made airtight by being covered with cement.</p><p>
Pieces of wood or thin stone slabs are also joined by sewing with roots, withes, whalebone, or other strong materials. Holes are drilled along the edges of the parts to be joined, and the strands are pushed and pulled through these holes. Sewing was done at an early time in a similar manner; holes were made with an awl, and the thread was pulled through the holes. The invention of needles with eyes seems to have been made in late Paleolithic times. Other methods of joining materials, like pegging and weaving, are also late inventions.</p><p>
In Neolithic times we find stone blades driven into a socket in a piece of antler which forms the handle or part of it. This method requires knowledge of the effect of heat upon antler. The stone tool can be driven into the soft central part and after cooling is held firmly. Such handles are found in pile dwellings in Switzerland * and were used until recent times by the Eskimo. In still later times blades were riveted to handles, the rivets requiring a perforation of the blade.</p><p>
Search for materials. Man was not always satisfied with the materials near at hand. There is early evidence of deliberate search for useful materials. In Mesolithic times there is already evidence of the mining of flint which was carried on in regions where there was an ample supply of surface material. The flint embedded in chalk was mined because it is better adapted for work.</p><p>
The search for materials is also proved by the occurrence of * See page 190, Fig. 34.</p><p>
objects carried over long distances. In the younger Paleolithic times shells from the Atlantic Ocean were found among the remains of the caves of Grimaldi near Mentone and in Cro-Magnon in the Dordogne. Mediterranean shells appear in Switzerland and southern Germany about the same period.</p><p>
Stone. The fundamental discoveries and inventions relate to the modifications of form of natural objects that make them more available to use. The observation that brittle stones when broken form sharp edges, added to the experience that sharp edges cut, has led to the intentional flaking of brittle stones. This development is proved more or less stringently by archaeological evidence (see pages IF.). The degree and refinement of intentional flaking increased slowly during early Quaternary time. To the process of breaking by strokes was added the shaping by pressure with a sharp bone, small fragments being split off from a core.</p><p>
Of different origin is the shaping of tough stones, which are worked by battering the surface until the desired shape is attained. This art may well have been discovered by the effect of pounding with a tough grained pebble the striking surface of which was gradually worn down. The time sequence of these achievements has been described before.</p><p>
Extensive use of polishing flaked stones belongs to a later period, and is characteristic of Neolithic times. Drilling and scraping of wood and piercing and scraping of skin were also practiced in early times. Drilling of stone and bone, particularly of large holes, was not used until Mesolithic and the beginning of Neolithic times. Stones are cut by a sawing motion performed with thongs or thin pieces of wood combined with sharp sand and water. When the cut is deep enough the pieces of stone are separated by a blow or b$ means of a wedge. Soft stones, like slate, are ground into shape and provided with sharp edges on gritstones.</p><p>
In one series of tools the blade is attached so that it forms the continuation of the axis of the handle, the cutting edges being on the sides, as in a double-edged knife; it may be pointed for piercing like a dagger, or provided with a cutting edge at the end like a chisel. In another series the blade stands at right angles to the handle, the cutting edge being either in the same plane as the bent handle, as in our axe, or at right angles to it, as in our adze. All these forms must be considered as the results of processes that were gradually developed by the use of stone tools.</p><p>
While the blades of all these utensils are in principle alike, the handles show great diversity according to the technological development of each people. Special blades and attachments, such as gouges and crooked knives made of stone, and slanting attachments were also developed.</p><p>
The toothed saw does not appear until Neolithic times, although some irregularly toothed blades of the late Paleolithic period may have been so used. The saw is not universal among primitive people. The Eskimo, for instance, cut large bones by means of a line of drill holes placed in close proximity. The two parts thus produced are then broken by means of a wedge, and the ridges left by the drill holes arc rubbed off with a rough stone. Thinner pieces of bone and deep grooves are probably cut by them with rough-edged thin flint blades.</p><p>
Wood. Wood for making large objects required a high development of stone, shell, or bone tools, for trees had to be felled and the wood worked with chisels, axes, or adzes. Wood is shaped by means of implements of stone, shell, or teeth. It is cut into shape or reduced to the desired form by means of gritstones. The surface is smoothed with rough skin or with leaves or stems containing silicious deposits. Large blocks of wood used as receptacles or canoes are hollowed out by means of fire and finished with axes or adzes. Bending of wood and bone by steaming is known to many tribes.</p><p>
Food. Even in Paleolithic times man secured food by hunting large animals, infinitely superior to him in strength and speed; also by using fruits, roots, grubs, shellfish, and the like that could easily be procured, The hunting of large game required cooperation of hunters and devices for killing that would not necessitate a hand-to-hand encounter with animals of a strength like that of the cave bear. The simple stone tools would hardly be adequate for this purpose. Hunting with an unhafted cleaver would have been an exceedingly hazardous undertaking, and probably inclosures, pitfalls, and other trapping devices were used by the early hunter. This seems the more likely since in the early Paleolithic period the large pachyderms such as elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus were the principal animals hunted. These could hardly be killed by a cleaver. Most of the bones are those of young animals which were more easily driven into inclosures or pitfalls. Some paintings of the late Paleolithic period seem to represent inclosures and traps. As soon as a reasonably long shaft allowed an attack from a point beyond</p><p>
the reach of the teeth and paws of the animal, hunting became safer. Cave animals may also have been smothered by smoke in their dens; animals of the steppe may have been killed by fires â€” all methods employed nowadays by primitive tribes.</p><p>
The invention of implements and devices for hunting and for obtaining vegetable foods will be described later (see pages ff.). The meat of animals, fresh or preserved, is roasted, boiled, or steamed. In Arctic climates frozen meat may be kept throughout the winter. In other regions it must be specially prepared. Knowledge of the anatomy of the animal is generally accurate. The muscles are split into thin sheets according to definite rules and dried in sun and wind or in smoke. Sometimes the dried meat is powdered and kept mixed with fat. Fish are also cut and sun-dried or smoked. The intestines of larger animals, so far as they serve as food, are eaten fresh, roasted, or cooked. Blood is used in the preparation of soups.</p><p>
Plants are also eaten raw or cooked. Many bulbs, roots, and fruits are preserved and used as staples for seasons in which no vegetable products can be gathered. Bulbs and roots are generally sun-dried. Dry seeds may be kept without any preparation. They need only protection against predatory animals, particularly rodents, and insects. Seeds are broken up either by pounding in a mortar or by grinding on a millstone. Berries and other juicy fruits are boiled to a jam and then dried.</p><p>
One of the most puzzling facts is the frequent use of plants which in their natural state are either unpalatable or actually poisonous. Among the former may be mentioned the bitter acorn and buckeye of California. These are ground by means of a pestle in a basket mortar, and the meal is leached until the bitterness is removed. In Australia, also, many acrid or poisonous plants are used which require a most elaborate treatment before they become edible. Best known among the poisonous plants are the manioc of South America and the potato, which in Peru, before being used, was exposed to frost and used only after the fluids had been removed by pressure. Complicated methods of preserving food and making it palatable are universal. 22</p><p>
The methods of preparing meals from the raw or preserved food products are principally roasting, boiling, and steaming. Roasting is generally done in ashes, broiling by the fire, boiling by throwing red-hot stones into appropriate vessels filled with water (see pages 239-241). Sometimes the fluid to be boiled is placed over a fire in stone</p><p>
kettles, as among the Eskimo, or in wet skin or bark receptacles which withstand the fire long enough to permit the contents to simmer or even to boil. Steaming in earthen ovens is widely practiced (see page 240). Baking on hot stones is found rarely; the Pueblo Indians, who bake cormneal wafers in this manner, present one of the few instances. Meal obtained from ground or pounded seeds, bulbs, or roots is almost universally used for preparing mushes.</p><p>
Intoxicants and narcotics. The use of intoxicating drinks and foods is widespread although not universal. Alcoholic drinks made of grain, roots, or tubers, juices of fruits, sap, milk, and honey are found in Africa, South America, Polynesia, and southeastern Asia. They were also known in ancient Europe. In the extreme northeastern part of Asia fly agaric is eaten to produce intoxication. The use of peyote spread widely among North American Indians and goes back to pre-Spanish times. Narcotics which are chewed are the betel, the coca of South America, and the pitcheri of Australia, to name only a few. Hemp, opium, and tobacco are smoked, chewed, and eaten. South American Indians use powdered seeds of an acacia as an intoxicating snuff. 23</p><p>
Medicine and poison. It would lead too far to enumerate the medical uses of plants. Every tribe has discovered the effects of many plants upon the human body and these are extensively used. Animal and vegetal poisons are used. Putrid tissues, snake and insect venoms, as well as poisons obtained from plants, are applied to points of arrows and to blowgun darts. Poisonous plants are thrown into the water to kill or benumb fish. Poison is also used in ordeals to detect guilt.</p><p>
Preparation of skins. The progress from tearing up or cutting up animals to careful skinning was certainly not easy, but we may safely assume that the discovery of the skinning of whole animals was made in early Paleolithic times. The elaborate process of curing the heavy hides of reindeer, bear, bison, and deer is probably a later achievement. It requires the careful scraping of the inner side. This is done either with a stone scraper or with a hoe-shaped stone implement. After this has been done many tribes work the inner surface with a grainer, which is applied until the skin becomes flexible. Generally the skin is rubbed with brains and fat to make it more flexible. Rawhide is obtained by drying the skin and scraping off the hair. Tanning was invented at a very late period. Skins are allowed to putrefy until the hair can be removed. The same end is attained by soaking the skin in lye from ashes or some other alkaline fluid. In Africa dung of cattle is used for this purpose. After being properly scraped and softened the skins are often smoked. Clothing and bags are made of skins.</p><p>
Bark cloth. The art of obtaining large sheets of material by felting fibers is used in Polynesia, Melanesia, southern Asia, and South America. The bark of certain trees (Bromsonetia, Ficm, etc.) is carefully peeled off, cleaned, and beaten with a mallet with a corrugated striking surface. By this process the fibers are felted, and in the Polynesian bark cloth they are beaten down to the thickness of a tough paper. Finally it is rubbed with the hands until it is soft and pliable. In Africa the pieces of bark cloth are rather small and are sewed together, while in Polynesia large sheets are manufactured. The bark cloth is often painted by hand, or colored designs are applied with stencils. 26</p><p>
Basketry and mat weaving. The simplest form of weaving consists of the intertwining of pliable branches or twigs between stiff rods. Such watling is used for fish traps and for the construction of shelters; later on it was filled with clay to form permanent walls. Closer weaving of pliable materials between warp strands is employed in the manufacture of coarse baskets. When a twist is given two adjoining strands of the woof, twined weaving originates. In a more complicated form of twining these strands are twisted around the warp so that every strand passes in front of two and behind one warp strand. The same technique is used with pliable warp. In plain up-and-down weaving, warp and woof are of the same width and pliability. This type of weaving is used for mats and to a lesser extent in baskets.</p><p>
These fundamental types of basket weaving lead to an infinite variety of forms, partly by skipping of warp strands in twining, so-called twilling, partly by varying the method of twining â€” for instance, by braiding woof strands instead of simply twisting, by introducing overlays or embroideries into the single meshes, or by wrapping the twining strands around a cross woof. These variations may have originated from the pleasure enjoyed when playing with strings and from that of mastery of a complex technique; perhaps also from the enjoyment of the figures resulting from the most complex forms of this technique. It would seem that the play with</p><p>
strings has been a most important element in the development of weaving and sewing. String games like cat's cradle are found all over the world, and knots of the most varied kinds are used everywhere. Tricks of opening apparently firm knots play an important part in the shamanistic procedure of many countries.</p><p>
Spinning. The step from basket- and mat-making to weaving is not sudden. In North America woven blankets are found which are technically analogous to twined baskets. Skins are cut into narrow strips and dried so that they become twisted and have the hair everywhere on the outside. These are united by twining with a warp made of vegetable fiber. In the same mariner soft bark is used as a warp and made into blankets by twining. All these manufactures depend upon the art of spinning, of making strong and sufficiently long threads of material such as vegetable fiber or hair. The general principle is that the fibers are twisted together and that new fiber is so introduced that it becomes interwoven with the material previously twisted together. A common method of securing this</p><p>
result is by rubbing the fiber, hair, or feathers on the thigh or on some flat surface, attaching the end to a spindle which revolves rapidly and twists the material into a stronger thread. Stronger threads are secured by twisting two or more such threads together.</p><p>
Weaving is done by hand, one set of threads being hung up as warp while another set of threads is passed with the fingers up and down the warp threads. Simple looms were used in many parts of the world although the art of weaving is not by any means universal.</p><p>
Sewing. Sewing of skins and of wood has been referred to. After the invention of the needle the variety of stitches increased considerably and various methods of embroidery developed. Sewing is also employed in the manufacture of coiled basketry. Bundles of material are wrapped with tough strands and twisted into coils which are sewn together with the wrapping strands. The coils vary considerably. Generally they consist of bundles of fibers, but in some cases single rods or a small number of rods are substituted. Great varieties of sewing are used, and the pleasure of play is expressed in this technique no less strongly than in the woven baskets. The stitches are so arranged as to produce varieties of patterns, and embroideries are added.</p><p>
Pottery. The art of pottery did not develop until Neolithic times. Its present distribution suggests that it was invented independently in the Old World and in the New World, for an extensive area in northwestern America separates the regions in which pottery occurs in the two hemispheres. The knowledge of plastic clay goes back to Paleolithic times. In Neolithic times earth ovens appear. When made in clayey soil or lined with clay, the sides are hardened by fire. The time to which these pits belong is uncertain, but considering the wide distribution of cooking in pits it seems likely that the effect of fire upon clay may have been discovered accidentally, particularly if it happened that the same pit was used several times. During the period to which the Neolithic pits belong, elaborate pottery was in use so that the knowledge of firing clay must have been much older. Besides this, clay is being used for making baskets and canoes watertight. After drying, the clay lining may have separated from the basket. Tylor has assembled evidence in favor of the theory that the making of pottery developed from the custom of protecting basketry or gourd vessels from being burned over the fire by covering them with clay which became fired when the fire was hot enough. While this did not often happen, the knowledge of the firing of clay in the earth oven together with the exposure of lined baskets to a hot fire, perhaps during a conflagration, may have given rise to the art.</p><p>
Generally the natural clay is fine-grained; and unless tempered by the addition of sand, pounded shells or stones, or pulverized pottery, the fired pot is fragile. The knowledge of tempering is found wherever better grades of pottery are made.</p><p>
Pots are shaped in various ways. They are moulded with the fingers out of a lump of clay. The walls are finished by being beaten flat with a light spatula while they are supported on the inside by a smooth stone. Vessels were also moulded in or over baskets, as is evidenced by the impression of the fabric on the outer side, or over gourds. In more advanced stages of pottery, moulds of fired clay were made, into which was pressed the clay for the objects to be manufactured.</p><p>
An entirely different method of making a clay vessel is by coiling. The process is strictly analogous to the manufacture of coiled basketry, only the coils of the plastic clay are merely pressed together (ind do not need sewing like the basketry coils. In all the more elaborate forms of pottery both the inner and the outer side of the pot are polished with some smooth material.</p><p>
Metal work. The use of metals which occur in pure state is probably contemporaneous with the development of Neolithic industries.. In America pure copper was used in the region of the Great Lakes, in the Mackenzie area, and on the North Pacific coast. It was hammered out into daggers and other weapons. The Eskimo used also meteoric iron, small blades of which were inserted in the edges of bone implements in the same way as pieces of flint were used when it was desired to obtain sharp cutting edges. According to tradition copper was heated on the Northwest Coast to make it more malleable. Pure gold was worked into ornaments. In Mexico it was melted and cast in lost forms. For instance, small bells were made by making a form of coils of beeswax which was covered inside</p><p>
and outside with clay. Then the whole was heated until the wax ran out and the molten metal was cast in the hollow form. The heat of the fire used for melting the metal was increased by means of a blowpipe.</p><p>
The reduction of metals is a much later invention which was presumably made in Asia or Africa. Bog iron (limonite), magnetic iron ore, and brown iron ore when mixed with charcoal and sufficiently heated are easily reduced in a simple smelting furnace to loupe (or bloom) which can be hammered out. The reduction of the ore requires an adequate supply of oxygen, which is secured by means of bellows. It may be presumed that the possibility of reducing iron ores was discovered accidentally in conflagrations. The whole process is so complicated that it must be based on many diverse experiences. The addition of charcoal as one essential had to be discovered. The necessity of increasing the heat of the fire by an artificial supply of oxygen had to lead to the development of the bellows, for the blowpipe did not furnish a sufficient amount of air for this purpose. First of all the usefulness of the iron which was obtained by this complicated process had to be found. Just how this came about can hardly be surmised. In the earliest finds iron serves merely as material for ornaments. It is soft and as material for cutting tools is much inferior to copper and bronze.</p><p>
The invention of bellows presupposes also many experiences. In this case it would seem that we may speak of an actual purposeful invention. It was necessary to obtain a continuous supply of air. First it may have been blown out of a single skin bag with attached tube, but then the bag had to be refilled. The possibility of speeding the filling of the bag through a slit which when pressed can be closed with the hand, and even the invention of the valve, may have been an accidental discovery, but the combination of two bags with connecting tubes which are filled with air and compressed alternately, thus securing a steady flow of air, was certainly a deliberate invention.</p><p>
Application of inventions. Although in the preceding pages the relation between discoveries and their uses, or the application of inventions, has been touched upon, it seems desirable to summarize briefly a few of the most important uses to which they are put.</p><p>
Devices for obtaining food. Weapons and mechanical traps have been described before. It remains to mention the various devices used for capturing animals. The simplest of these is the pitfall dug on the trail of animals and hidden by branches. Sometimes sharp posts are set in the bottom so that the animal falling into the pit becomes impaled. In both land hunting and fishing, devices are used that lead the game into a trap from which it cannot escape. Wolves are caught in a double circular enclosure of posts driven into the ground (Fig. 55). The wolf enters through a door that opens only inward, and finds himself in the narrow space between the two circles, in which he cannot turn. Running around, he closes the door and cannot escape.</p><p>
Fish are caught in traps based on a similar principle (Fig. 56). They consist of a lohg basket into the opening of which a short inverted basket is inserted, open at the end, through which the fish can enter but which prevents their escape. They are connected with weirs that lead the fish into the basket trap. In a similar way land animals are driven by a group of hunters towards converging nets that have a narrow outlet, or they are driven into a converging enclosure of bushes closed at the narrow end by a net. Here hunters are stationed who kill the animals. Herds of game animals are also surrounded from one side and driven towards a precipice. They kill themselves by jumping over, or are dispatched by the hunter. Others are driven into the water and killed while swimming. Nets spanned over a large frame are thrown over birds. Fish are caught with hooks, in bag nets and drift nets. Hunting in disguise is much practiced. The Eskimo in sealskin clothing imitates the movements of the barking seal and thus approaches it. The Indians used to conceal themselves under complete skins of deer, and stalk the game in this disguise. The Bushmen dress themselves like ostriches and thus stalk their game.</p><p>
Tribes that have no agriculture, or only the most primitive methods of cultivating plants, use the digging stick for gathering roots or tubers. The digging stick is made of hard wood and provided with a sharp point. The Bushmen increase its effectiveness by the attachment of a perforated stone. In other cases a crossbar is attached, on which the worker steps. The New Caledonians use the digging stick in preparing their fields. These men work in a line, push down their digging sticks to a depth of more than a foot, and jointly turn over the soil, which is then broken up by the women. The spade must be considered as developed from the digging stick.</p><p>
The most important implement of primitive agriculture is the hoe, which is either formed like a pick or has a broad blade, often running into a point. While the workers who use the digging stick shove the tool forward, those who use the hoe pull it towards themselves.</p><p>
The difference is worth remembering when we try to understand the origin of the plow. The simplest forms of plows seem to be digging sticks pulled forward instead of being shoved forward. The uniformity of the principle employed in the plow, the range of its distribution in the Old World, and its absence in all the outlying parts of the Old World as well as in the whole New World make it certain that it is a single invention which has spread at a late period from a single center. In Egypt the plow was known in the Old Empire.</p><p>
Grass seeds are cleaned in flat winnowing baskets. The seeds are tossed up and the chaff is blown away by the wind. Berries are cleaned by being rolled down along wet planks, the leaves adhering to the plank while the berries roll down on a mat or into a receptacle.</p><p>
In several parts of the world gardens are irrigated by a system of ditches. These were found in the southwestern parts of the United States. In Malay countries and elsewhere in Oceania terraces are built on steep hills to retain the soil and to regulate irrigation. (See also pp. ff.)</p><p>
Protection against attack. In treating of the methods of increasing the natural strength of the hand in striking or throwing, their application in various tools and weapons has been mentioned. A word may be added in regard to the invention of the shield. The simplest protective shield consists of a staff or a narrow piece of wood, with a handle in the middle, which is used for parrying the thrust of a spear or the blow of a club. Such shields are found for instance in Australia and on the upper Nile. For protection against rapid projectiles such as lances and arrows it is useless, and wide shields made of wood or thick hide are in use. The body is also protected by armor made of heavy hide, of slats or rods of wood or bone tied together, or of closely woven heavy fabric. The head is sometimes protected by a wooden helmet or one woven of tough fiber.</p><p>
Shelter. Protection against climate is afforded by the house. The earliest house was probably the cave, which is still used in some parts of the world. The simplest structures are windbreaks made of branches of trees. Other simple huts or tents consist of frames which are covered with mats or skins. Some Eskimo tribes use as support a single pole over which a thong is stretched, the ends being held by heavy stones. A te^t cover made of skin is thrown over the thong and held extended by stones. More complicated tents have the form of a gable roof, front and back each being formed by a pair of poles tied together near the top and spread apart at the bottom. The two pairs are connected by a ridge pole. Simple lean-tos are constructed in similar manner. Sometimes these are very long, serving as ceremonial or communal houses.</p><p>
The frames of round huts are often made of saplings which intercross and are buried at both ends. This structure is covered with matting or similar material. When necessary, the hut is further protected by a covering of brush, sod, and the like. Round tents are also constructed over converging poles, often leaning against a central tripod. They have an opening on top for a smoke escape and a flap which serves as a door. Underground houses or frequent occurrence. They are generally of more solid construction than the tents. The walls of the pit are supported by wood, bone, or stone. When such houses are built on a slope a frame is erected for the front part, over which poles are laid as supports for the roof. In other houses of this kind four posts are erected in the pit, which support heavy rafters slanting upward from the sides of the pit to the center. Over these, horizontal poles are laid, which in turn are covered with dirt or other material. The entrance is often through an opening in the center of the roof, a ladder reaching from the middle of the pit up through the smoke hole. In other cases the entrance is at one side. In Arctic climates it is further protected by a tunnel.</p><p>
Large wooden houses are rather rare. They occur on the Northwest Coast of America. In the region of northern Puget Sound they reach enormous size, many sections being joined so as to form a single structure which is used as a communal house. The corners are made of posts which are connected by beams. The sides are made of boards which are tied between pairs of holding posts. The roof is either a shed or a gable roof. Whenever boards or horizontally placed poles or logs are used in house-building, the ground plan is necessarily rectangular. Houses built in shallow water are on platforms supported by piles; others, built on the slope of hills, are on a foundation of crossed logs. Large rectangular houses are also common in southeastern Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and Melanesia.</p><p>
In arid areas houses are also built of clay or of sun-dried bricks covered with some kind of rain-resisting plaster. Buildings of this type are strengthened when the foundations of the work are straw, wattling, or the like, which is filled with clay.</p><p>
Stone architecture is a late invention. In early Europe it is confined to the Mediterranean and later on to the Atlantic coastal region. In America it is confined to the advanced people of the Andean plateaus and to Mexico and part of Central America and to rather weak beginnings in the southwestern deserts of the United States.</p><p>
Special mention should be made of the Eskimo snow house, a true vault constructed of spirally arranged blocks of snow.</p><p>
Villages are protected against hostile attack partly by being built in inaccessible places, like the tops of steep hills, even on ledges or in recesses of steep cliffs, or by being surrounded by palisades or walls.</p><p>
Clothing. Protection against the rigors of the climate was in early use. It is probable that we overestimate the need of clothing for people living in climates like that of Tierra del Fuego or of the Northwest Coast of America. The Indians of the Mackenzie valley are scantily clad. The difference in the desire for protection between them and the neighboring Eskimo is particularly striking. Skins were presumably the earliest kind of clothing used. Many of the Paleolithic scrapers and awls were presumably used in the preparation of skins. It is unlikely that the hides of the large pachyderms, cave bears, and lions gave impetus to the preparation of skins. It seems more likely that we have to assume that birds and small mammals, the skins of which require for their preservation only drying and rubbing, were attached td the most sensitive parts of the body. The attempts of apes to cover themselves with leaves suggest the beginning of the use of more permanent coverings.</p><p>
The problem of the invention of clothing cannot be answered with any degree of certainty. It is not self-evident that man on account of the loss of hair of the body was compelled to seek for an artificial covering. He may well have lived during the warm periods of Paleolithic times without any covering. However, at the beginning of the younger Paleolithic period we find evidence of the use of ornaments. The conditions under which man lived at that period did not make it absolutely essential for him to have more protection than a blanket, for besides the reindeer there lived other animals, like the deer, that require a temperate climate. The scrapers and awls found at this time make it probable that skins were prepared and sewed.</p><p>
It has been suggested that all clothing developed from ornament. This does not seem plausible, because the desire for ornamentation and that for protection are based on entirely different mental attitudes. Apes enjoy carrying flowers or other attractive objects as ornaments. This desire has nothing to do with the protection they seek in covering their bodies with leaves. On account of the limitations of clothing among the most scantily clad tribes to the regions of the sexual organs it has been claimed that the origin of clothing is due to a peculiar inborn modesty, to the aversion to expose the organs of sex. It seems impossible to reduce the origin of clothing to a single cause, for need of protection, fondness of ornament, and modesty â€” whatever its origin â€” must each have contributed its share.</p><p>
In the development of clothing we may distinguish between the simpler forms, which consist of some kind of material cut into suitable form so that it can be wrapped around the body, and tailored clothing. The former type includes loin cloths, aprons, blankets, wrappings around the legs, and simple sandals. Tailored clothing includes shirts, leggings, moccasins, and caps, all of manifold forms.</p><p>
Ornaments. A variety of materials, techniques, and objects of manufacture are used for ornamenting the body. The body is painted or tattooed. Among people with dark skin ornamental scars are more frequent than tattooing. The teeth are filed or knocked out, among some people even inlaid. Ears, nose, cheeks, and lips are perforated for the attachment of ornaments such as plugs, strings, rods, or the like. The head is deformed by pressure. The faces of infants are moulded in the expectation that permanent effects will result. Thus Negroes flatten the noses, Indians try to shape the cheeks. Other</p><p>
parts of the body are deformed according to local customs. The Indians of Vancouver Island tie the ankles of women so as to secure slim ankles. The Chinese used to deform the feet of women.</p><p>
Painting, carving, inlaying, and artistic wrapping are used for obtaining artistic effects on objects of use. In weaving, twilling of colored materials gives rise to a wealth of artistic forms.</p><p>
Transportation. Ease of locomotion is secured by a variety of inventions. For travel by foot, protection of the sole is obtained by means of sandals, and of the whole foot by vari^Mg^pes of shoes with hard or soft soles. For climbing and for supj^Hp^hen carrying heavy loads, staffs are used. Travel over soft snow is facilitated by the use of snowshoes â€” in the Old World skis, and in the New World generally netted frames. Swimming is to be considered a means of locomotion in a limited sense only. Almost all primitive people living near water are good swimmers.</p><p>
Loads are transported by being carried on the head or on the back. Head loads, particularly pots with rounded bottoms, are supported on stuffed rings or pads which are laid on the head. Back loads are held in place by a packstrap passing over the forehead or over the chest. The ends of the straps are attached to loops at the top of baskets or bags, or slung around the load.</p><p>
Branchless thin trees are climbed by the Aeta of the Philippine Islands by clasping the trunk with the hands and placing the soles of the feet against the trunk. Then the climber walks up the tree. Malay tribes and South American Indians climb larger trees by passing a rope around the tree and over the small of the back, thus forming a loop. Pressing the soles of the feet against the trunk and holding the loop tightly, they walk up the trees. The tribes of the North Pacific coast of America add to this loop a wooden seat through which the rope passes. Trees are also climbed by means of pegs driven into the wood as the climber ascends.</p><p>
Ladders are made of the trunks of trees notched on one side.</p><p>
Trails are kept open by frequent traffic. In South America and Indonesia, rivers are spanned by suspension bridges (Fig. 60). In the Malay Archipelago the footway of bridges is sometimes laid over a series of supports, each consisting of two converging stakes, driven into the river bed and tied together near the top.</p><p>
Other means of transportation by land are tied up with the use of domesticated animals. The most ancient domesticated animal is the dog, and it is used for carrying and hauling loads. The loads to be carried by the dogs are tied on like saddlebags. On the North American plains the dog is used to drag a small travois, an arrangement consisting of two poles which are attached to a simple harness and to the middle part of which, as support for the load, a netted frame is attached. More important is the use of dogs with the sledge for transportation over snow. A number of dogs are attached to the sledge, either fanlike or tandem. The sledge itself in its simplest form is a toboggan; in more complex forms it is built upon a pair of runners. TJBfc^e of the dog as a draft animal for small carts has</p><p>
survived in Europe up to the present time. After the introduction of the horse the North American travois was enlarged and used for transportation of goods by horses. In South America the llama was used as a pack animal. A most important step forward in the art of transportation was made with the invention of the wheel, which in an open, level country took the place of more primitive means of hauling loads. It is probable that this invention was first made in Neolithic times in Asia. It is absent in Africa south of the Sudan and had not been invented in America at the time of the discovery. Both the sledge and the wheeled cart provided a means of more rapid transportation of man himself.</p><p>
The oldest monuments show the warrior drawn by horses on a chariot, not riding. It seems that the art of riding is more recent than the carrying of loads on the backs of animals and the hauling of vehicles. It probably originated somewhere in central Asia.</p><p>
The simplest method of transportation by water is by means of floating logs. Simple canoes are made of a large piece of bark, held spread by means of thwarts, or by hollowing out a tree. The former type is common in South America and Australia; the latter is widely distributed over all the other continents. Much more complex are bark and skin canoes stretched over a wooden skeleton â€” like the birchbark canoes of North America and Siberia and the kayaks of the Eskimo. Skin-covered round tubs, like the Welsh coracle and the bull boat of the Mandan Indians, are used locally.</p><p>
Rafts are made by tying together bundles of reeds or logs. Much more complex is the boat built of timbers. A gunwale raised by sewing a narrow board on to the dugout occurs in British Columbia. Boats with keels consisting of hollowed trees and sides built up of boards are found in Polynesia. Greater steadiness is secured by connecting two canoes by means of a platform or by attaching an outrigger â€” a swimmer held firmly by means of crossbars at some distance from the body of the canoe. These forms are characteristic of the islands of the Pacific and Indian oceans. Double canoes are also used on the Northwest Coast of America.</p><p>
The art of sailing before the wind is known to the Eskimo and the Northwest</p><p>
Coast Indians. The former pig Dog travoig (aftef Wiss , er) used sails made ot thin skin,</p><p>
the latter those made of thin boards sewed together. Sailing close to the wind is known to all the maritime people of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>
Games and tricks. Many inventions are used in games of skill. Almost all kinds of weapons like spears, bow and arrows, and blow-guns are also used in playing. Skill in throwing and hitting is trained in ball games, in catching or hitting objects that are swung suspended from a string, and in hitting rolling rings with spears. For ball games a variety of types of bats have been invented, each serving a particular purpose. String games are played almost everywhere. 31</p><p>
Technical knowledge plays an important part in tricks performed in ceremonials. One of the best known is the handling of knots. The performer is apparently firmly tied but frees himself by opening the knots. Other tricks are based on the skillful handling of invisible strings, on ventriloquism, and the use of speaking tubes. Devices for deceiving the uninitiated are innumerable. Among tribes that use fire tricks it seems to be known that stones or metals in white heat can be handled with impujuty.</p><p>
Medicine. The knowledge of the properties of poisons and of plants of medicinal values has been mentioned. Here we have to refer to the use of mechanical devices. Massage is widely practiced. It is reported from Easter Island M and Samoa. The Indians of Vancouver Island massage the abdomen in cases of constipation; the Crow Indians against stomach-ache. It is also commonly practiced in connection with shamanistic procedure. Its use for bringing about abortion is probably known everywhere. Pressure by means of circular bandages is used to alleviate headaches and pains in the stomach. Perspiration is produced by placing the patient in a heated ditch or in a steam bath. The latter is widely used in North America, where it is often followed by a plunge in cold water. In Australia the affected part of the body is steamed while the whole body of the patient is covered with furs. Scarification is in common use. Generally the blood is sucked out with the mouth. Opening of the veins and cupping are also reported. To stop bleeding, powdered charcoal, bird's down, and other similar materials are used. Abscesses are cut and the pus is removed by sucking or washing. The wounds are protected by poultices. In case of snake-bite some tribes make cuts around the bite, or scarify and tie a ligament above the bite. Cauterization is used for treating abscesses and to cure headaches or backaches. Emetics of various kinds are used. Tickling of the throat is resorted to. Enemata are given by means of tubes. Broken bones are set in splints or covered with clay which hardens and forms a protective cover. In other cases a cut is made, a splint is placed alongside the broken bone, and the whole is firmly bandaged. Later the splint is removed. Amputations are undertaken ritualistically rather than for surgical purposes although the latter are not missing. Certain natives of southeast Australia amputate two joints of one little finger, or remove them by stopping the blood supply by means of a tight bandage and letting ants eat off the mortified tissues. The Tsimshian of British Columbia cut off one joint of the fourth finger to put an end to a succession of deaths in a family. Amputations of hands or noses as forms of punishment have been reported from many parts of the world.</p><p>
The sewing up of wounds is not unknown. In East Africa when the mother dies in childbirth the Cesarian operation is performed in order to save the child. There is also a report of a successfully performed Cesarian operation from Uganda. The incision was closed by needles pushed through the margins of the wound and wound around with thread (sutura circumvoluta).</p><p>
Trephining is widespread. Trephined skulls from Neolithic graves of Europe have been collected. Numerous specimens from Peru, New Caledonia, and the Loyalty Islands are known.</p><p>
A number of operative procedures of the sexual organs are customary. Circumcision is most widely distributed. In Australia sub-incision is practiced, which consists in slitting open the urethra. Excision of the clitoris, sometimes connected with infibulation, is practiced in Africa. The castration of domesticated animals is known to primitive people. Thus the Hottentot castrate their cattle and the Hidatsa Indians their dogs. 45</p><p>
Writing. The art of phonetic writing is unknown to primitive man, but he has devices for recording and communicating by means of conventional symbols which are understood by his tribesmen. Many of these are used for counting. The South American Indians use knotted strings which indicate the number of days that are to elapse before a festival. The invited guests open one knot every day and arrive on the day when all the knots have been opened. The Indians of British Columbia indicate the amount owed by a person by small cedar sticks, one length indicating blankets, another canoes.</p><p>
Another type of communication is by means of conventional signals. The Thompson Indians of British Columbia indicate by four small slanting wands stuck in the ground that four persons had left that camp in the direction indicated by the slant. A larger stick points to where the sun was when the party left. Fresh leaves placed near the sticks give information telling about how many days previously the party had started. A number of hairs from a horse's tail shows the number of horses they had. Deer's hair tied on the horse's hair show r s that they were carrying venison. A stick placed apart with a fishbone or a root tied to it shows that they were out of provisions and were living on fish or roots. 46</p><p>
Smoke signals are also used as means of communication. By covering repeatedly with a blanket the column of smoke produced by throwing wet grass on a fire, it is interrupted and in this way information is spread. The meaning is either traditional or prearranged.</p><p>
Other devices serving the purpose of communication or of assisting the memory are numerous. The Australians send messengers with message sticks in which notches are cut, each representing part of the message. The notches are intended as a help to the memory of the messenger. Alone they have no meaning except in a very few cases in which notches in definite places have attained a traditional significance.</p><p>
Pictographs are used in a similar way. The Ojibwa and other eastern Indians used a series of pictographs marked on birchbark to remember the sequence of songs in a ceremony. Thus the six designs shown in Figure signify the following: (1) The god of thunder and lightning filling all space. (2) A drum. (3) A drum ornamented with feathers. (4) A raven. (5) A crow. (6) A medicine lodge. Each of these recalls a song that occurs in this particular order. Of similar type are the year counts of the Dakota in which an outstanding event of each year is recorded by means of a symbol; for instance, two men in distinctive hair dress holding peace pipes indicate the conclusion of peace between two tribes (Fig. 63, 4)- The Dakota also indicate pictographically the name of a person by attaching a symbol of the animal to the head of the person. In Figure 63, No. represents a man called Wolf; No. 2, Eagle Feather; and No. 3, Little Moon. 60</p><p>
The use of pictography is widespread. In Africa simple outlines scratched into a gourd are symbolic representations of proverbs. These have been recorded from Togo and the Congo. Thus the design of a double bell means that it may be rung only at the time of the death of a chief. They are also used to record complex events. Most of the latter are probably not intelligible without explanations.</p><p>
Still more complex is the pictographic writing of Ibo which is used exclusively by a secret society. Figure a represents married love; b a quarrel between husband and wife; in c the man (1) has eloped with the woman (2) and pays compensation (4) on account of the woman (2) to her husband (3) and to her family (5); d represents an inconstant heart; in e the curved line represents a snake, the dots its poison, and the crossline the knife with which it has been killed.</p><p>
Cases in which pictures were given phonetic values independent of their significance occur in ancient Mexican writing, particularly in place names. An example is the name Mapachtepec, Raccoon Mountain. It is represented by the symbol for ma(itl), hand; pach(tli), the long lichens Usnea; and tepee, in a mountain. In the same way Petlatlan is rendered by the syllables petla(tl), mat; and tlan from Oan(tK), teeth.</p><p>
Science. Man has not only utilized his experience in handling materials but has also, at an early time, learned to observe nature in such a manner as to utilize his experiences in regulating his activities. Astronomical and meteorological observations and those relating to the tides are probably most widely found. Almost all primitive tribes have a lunar calendar. Most of the moons are designated according to the changing aspects of vegetation, the ripening of wild fruits, or the phases of animal life. Thus we find twelve moons among the Hottentot largely named according to seasonal changes of vegetation. The Thompson Indians count eleven months and an indefinite rest of the year. They begin with (1) the rutting season of deer, followed by (2) the moon when people go into their winter houses, (3) the moon when bucks shed their antlers, (4) the spring winds, (5) leaving the winter houses, (6) fishing, (7) root-digging, (8) ripening of berries, (9) summer solstice, (10) salmon run, (11) fish reach the heads of the rivers. The Koryak count twelve months, many of which refer to the phases of the life of the reindeer. The Maori begin the year with June, the rising of the star Puanga, and count thirteen months. The Marquesans counted twelve or thirteen months. Both had names for the days and nights of the month. 58</p><p>
Observations of certain phases of the positions of the heavenly bodies are frequent. Among the Hottentot and South American Indians the beginning of one month is determined by the rising of the Pleiades. The Thompson Indians as well as the Coast Indians of British Columbia and the Pueblos carefully observe the summer and winter solstices and readjust their calendar accordingly. The solstice is determined by observing from a definite position the day when the rising or setting sun reaches its most northern or southern point. The Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island determine the time of the arrival of the olachen, a fish that furnishes the indispensable oil, by the relation of high tide and the moon. They set out when the high tide of the second moon after the winter solstice is in the early morning. Wherever the year is counted to have twelve moons there is one long moon to equalize solar and lunar years.</p><p>
Among the Mexicans and Maya, a calendar had been developed by the priests based on a combination of divinatory and ceremonial units of thirteen days adjusted to a solar year. The divinatory cycle consisted of twenty periods of thirteen days each. Each of the twenty periods had a name and each of the thirteen days a number. The year consisted of days divided into eighteen periods of twenty days each. The remaining five days were considered an unlucky period. The least common multiple of X and (= X 73) is X 365, so that after years the same divinatory combination will occur. The combination may also be written as X X so that it contains both the elements of the divinatory and solar calendar. The revolution of Venus takes X days. These two periods may also be brought into relation.</p><p>
The Micronesians not only used the constellations as guides in their navigation but also observed the direction of the swell of the sea. On the basis of these observations they made sailing charts consisting of frames of thin rods tied together. The central vertical line in Figure represents the course to be followed. Inside of the lower triangle this line represents the meeting of the east and west swell deflected by the island of Jalut. The sailor follows this line until he reaches the steady easterly swell north of point (1). He continues sailing at right angles to the swell. When he approaches Ailinglaplap he strikes again the meeting of the deflected swell and steers along the line of meeting of the easterly and westerly swell.</p><p>
The boats are so built that the lee side is much steeper than the gently curved weather side, which is on the side of the outrigger. This seems to have the effect that the waves pass under the boat more easily. In sailing, the outrigger is always kept on the luff side so that the sail has to be taken back or forward on each tack and the boat goes forward first with one end and then with the other. 60</p><p>
Among some of the peoples in whose economic life large numbers play an important r61e, additions are made without difficulty. Thus the Kwakiutl in important transactions add numbers of blankets paid, canoes, and other objects the value of which is counted in blankets. Thus in one case a man paid for a valuable object 4- + + + (iOO blankets, + canoes worth + + blankets, + blankets, -4- canoes each worth blankets, + blankets, a total of blankets which were added after each amount had been deposited. For values borrowed, definite amounts of interest are charged.</p><p>
The Maya of Yucatan had developed a method of writing numbers, of adding and subtracting. They had also invented a symbol for zero and gave a value to their numbers according to position. The ascending values of digits in their writing are for the first higher unit, :Â«>() for the second, for the third, 144,000 for the fourth. The numerals up to four are indicated by dots, each five by a bar. Thus the number may be designated by three bars and four dots. The higher units are written so that the highest is on top. The Aztecs indicated by a finger, by a flag, by hair, by a pouch in which copal w T as carried. These were written side by side. 62
The quipus of Peru have been proved to be also a system of numerical writing. The quipu consists of a string from which groups of pendants hang down. These are knotted, the knots being arranged in rows. The row farthest away from the main string represents units; the one nearer to the main string, tens; the next hundreds; and so on. To each group is attached one single string which gives in the same manner the sum total of all the knots in the group. The diagram (Fig. 69) illustrates this system.</p><p>
Measurements are needed for many purposes. The standards of linear measurements are generally taken from parts of the body. On the coast of British Columbia the principal measures were a finger width; a long span (from thumb to tip of fourth finger); a short span (from thumb to tip of first finger); a cubit (from elbow to tip of second finger); half a fathom; a fathom. The Hupa of California measured their dentalium shells by the length of the finger joints and by marks tattooed on the forearm according to certain accepted standards. In southern California the measures are rather based on the length of the second finger and the circumference of the hand and forearm. I do not know of any kind of hollow measures except clam shells for medical administration of fluids and buckets or vessels of fairly standardized size.</p><p>
The Peruvians had invented beam scales G7 with an original method of determining equilibrium.</p><p>
When exact forms are to be made, measurement becomes indispensable. As an example I give a method used by the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island in laying out the lines for a square house. A rope is run from the center of the line where the front is to be to the center of the rear,.and the ends are staked off. Then the rope is halved. One half-length is stretched to the right, the other to the left of the middle front stake. Next another rope is used to measure the distance from the rear stake to the ends of the front rope, which is adjusted until these two distances are equal. In this way the front line is made to be exactly at right angles to the medial line. The rear corners are determined in the same way in reference to the stake in the middle of the front line.</p><p>

CHAPTER XII</p><p>
LITERATURE, MUSIC, AND DANCE FRANZ BOAS</p><p>
Among some of the most primitive tribes very few objects of artistic value are found. This is easily understood, for the roaming life of the hunter and the necessity of constant application for obtaining the bare necessities of life do not leave much time for manual work beyond that required for the pursuit of game and the collection of other kinds of food. Furthermore, the whole amount of property that can be carried along is small. The family cannot burden itself with many unnecessary or unfinished products, and the completion of artistic work requires time. The Eskimo who returns to his semipermanent house every day and whose hunting gear is in good condition may amuse himself with ivory-carving, which he may take up in long evenings or during snowstorms that make hunting impossible, but the total amount of such work and its size are necessarily restricted. Still more unfavorable are conditions for the Bushman who has to travel on foot and who has still less leisure to follow artistic inclinations. Leisure is indispensable for artistic handiwork, and a certain amount of stability or transportation by means of animals seems indispensable for its development. Stone work, stone architecture, and heavy wood work presuppose stability of residence.</p><p>
Such restrictions are not present in the arts of literature, music, and dance, for the hunter watching for game or leisurely attending to his traps may give free rein to his imagination without interfering with his watchful waiting. Out of the daydreams of the hunter and of the woman attending to her housework, stories and songs may be spun.</p><p>
The world-wide distribution of tales and songs shows that these considerations are valid. The Bushman and the eastern Eskimo, although poor in the production of art, are rich in tales and songs, of which they possess a well-nigh inexhaustible treasure. The poor hunters of the Malay peninsula and the Australians have their literature no less than economically more advanced people. Songs</p><p>
and tales are found all over the world. These are the fundamental forms of literature among primitive people.</p><p>
The essential traits of song are rhythm and melody. Rhythm belongs not only to song but also to prose. Repetition, particularly rhythmic repetition, is a fundamental trait of both. All prose narrative consists in part of free elements the form of which is dependent upon the taste and ability of the narrator. Inserted among these passages we find others of fixed form which give to the narrative its formal attractiveness. Often these passages consist of conversation between the actors, in which deviations from the fixed formula are not permitted. In other cases they are of rhythmic form and must be considered poetry or chants rather than prose.</p><p>
It 'is very difficult to gain a correct understanding of the form of primitive prose, because most of the available material has been recorded in European languages only, and it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the rendering. In most of the records there is an obvious attempt to adopt European literary styles. Even when the material is available in the original text we may assume that, at least in the majority of cases, it does not reach the standard of excellence of the native narrative. The difficulty of phonetic rendering of foreign languages requires such slowness of dictation that the artistic style necessarily suffers. The number of collectors who have complete mastery of the native language is altogether too small. The best approximation to the art of narrative of primitive people is probably found in those cases in which educated natives write down the texts, or in the records taken down by missionaries who, in long years of personal, intimate contact with the people, have acquired complete control of their language, and who are willing to give us just what they hear. In some cases natives have been trained to write with such ease that their writings may be considered as good representation of style. Early examples of this kind are tales published by Eskimos. Recently some attempts have been made to take down texts on the phonograph and to have them redictated sentence by sentence.</p><p>
In almost all reliable collections the fixed formal parts are of considerable importance. It is not easy to form a correct opinion regarding the rhythmic character of the formal prose, partly because the rhythmic sense of primitive people is much more highly developed than our own. The simplification of the rhythm of modern folk song, and of poetry intended to appeal to popular taste, has dulled our</p><p>
feeling for rhythmic form. It requires careful study to understand the structure of primitive rhythm, more so in prose than in song, because in this case the help of the melodic pattern is lacking.</p><p>
I believe the liking for the frequent repetition of single motives is in part due to the pleasure given by rhythmic repetition. For example, the tales of the Chinook Indians are always so constructed that five brothers, one after another, have the same adventure. The four eldest perish while the youngest one comes out successful. The tale is repeated verbatim for all the brothers, and its length, which to our ear and taste is intolerable, probably gives pleasure by the repeated form. Conditions are quite similar in European fairy tales relating the fates of three brothers, two of whom perish or fail in their tasks while the youngest one succeeds.</p><p>
Repetitions leading to a climax are also found. Thus in Tsimshian tales an eagle is said to screech every morning. The hero comes out of the house following the call and finds every day a larger animal on the beach in front of his house. A similar device occurs in the German tales of the fisherman whose wife sends him day after day to ask a wonderful fish to give him ever greater gifts. Every time he uses the same verse when calling the fish.</p><p>
In the tales of the Pueblo Indians the same incident is repeated four times, happening to four sisters: the yellow, red, blue, and white girl. In a Papua tale from New Guinea the birds come one after another and try to peck open the stomach of a drowned person so as to let the water he has swallowed run out. In a New Ireland tale the birds try to throw the cassowary off the branch of a tree on which it is perched. One after another alights next to him on the same branch but nearer the trunk. Thus he is compelled to move out farther and farther until finally he drops down. Similar repetitions are found in the German tale of Red Ridinghood, in the widely spread European story of the rooster who goes to bury his mate, and in the story of the Three Bears. In Oriental tales the incidents of the tale are sometimes repeated verbatim, being retold by one of the heroes.</p><p>
Much more striking are rhythmic repetitions in the formal parts of tales or in those cases in which connecting discussion is omitted. An example is the following Eskimo tale of a woman and the spirit of the singing-house:</p><p>
"Where is its owner? Where is its master?"</p><p>
Has the singing-house an owner? Has the singing-house a master? It has no owner." â€” "Here he is, there he is!"</p><p>
"Where are his feet? Where are the calves of his legs? Where are his knees? Where are his thighs?" â€” "Here they are, there they are!"</p><p>
"Where is his stomach?" â€” "Here it is, there it is!" "Where is his chest? Where is his arm? Where is his neck? Where is his head?" â€” "Here it is, there it is!" "He had no hair."</p><p>
Sometimes these parts of talcs are in an archaic form or in a foreign language, so that they may be quite unintelligible. Their impressive-ness rests on their form and the general emotional trend of the passages in which they occur. </p><p>
In oratory, rhythmic repetitions are used for purposes of emphasis and imprcssiveness. An Indian who welcomes his guests in his house and who wishes to recall the greatness of his ancestors addresses his hearers as follows: </p><p>
" This is the house of my great-great-grandfather Mahwa who invited</p><p>
you here. This is the house of my great-grandfather Mahwa who invited you</p><p>
at Sandy Beach. This is the house of my grandfather Mahwa who invited you at</p><p>
Crooked Beach. This is the feasting house of my father who invited you at Tide</p><p>
Beach. Now I have taken the place of my father. I invited you, tribes, that</p><p>
you should come and see my house here."</p><p>
Similar are the Polynesian chants in which the ancestors are enumerated:</p><p>
Hulihonua the husband,</p><p>
Keakahuliiani the wife;</p><p>
Laka the husband, Kapapaiakele the wife;</p><p>
Kamooalewa the husband,</p><p>
Nanawahine the wife;</p><p>
and so through twenty-seven pairs.</p><p>
In oratory rhythm is also applied to give fixed form to free discourse. This is sometimes obtained by a delivery in which the phrases are given somewhat equal length with accent on the last, sometimes an added, syllable. Thus the Ivwakiutl will address his guests: " Wel- come-ai', brothers-ai', at my feast-ai'," always connecting the -a/ firmly with the preceding word; or by introducing every phrase with ha. Similar devices are used in the recital of myths, as when the Fox Indians repeat after every phrase of their Culture Hero myth the syllables nootchee nootchee. Sometimes the phrasing is made by a pause in which the listeners supply the rhythmic break. Thus, in Africa, the narrator may tell, "The Turtle killed the Leopard/' and the audience will repeat, clapping their hands, "The Leopard, the Leopard."</p><p>
More definite and clearer rhythmic structure appears in poetry. Primitive rhythmic poetry that is not sung is, as far as I am aware, unknown. It is therefore more correct to speak of song rather than of poetry. All song is accompanied by body movements that are.often associated with noise, such as hand-clapping or stamping the ground; also by swaying of the body. Therefore poetry, music, and dance form an inextricable unit. Only gradually is poetry dissociated from music and dance, and music from dance, while dance seems to be almost indissolubly connected with music.</p><p>
Since song is so often accompanied by movement, there is commonly a coordination of two kinds of rhythms: that of song and that of movement. On the whole the regularity of emphasis on every second, third, or fourth time-interval which is characteristic of modern folk music, forming our regular two, three, and four part measures, is not the rule in primitive music. Longer units are found, such as five or seven part rhythms as well as long units that cannot be divided into regular measures, but which are regularly repeated.</p><p>
The coordination of song and movement is also often different from ours. We are accustomed to move in accord with the accented measures, but very commonly the coordination follows different patterns leading to various types of syncope, to the combination of one rhythm in song with another in movement. When the movement is accompanied by sound, as in hand-clapping or stamping, we have a new acoustic rhythm developing through the combination of the two. In Africa this multiplicity of interweaving rhythms is augmented by the independence of rhythmic movements of different parts of the body, particularly of the two hands and the two feet, which create new complexities.</p><p>
The great variety of forms in which rhythm appears, as rhythm of time in music and dance, rhythm of space in decorative art, shows that the theory of Biicher, who derives rhythm from the regularity</p><p>
of movements in communal work, or the parallel theory of Wundt, who derives it from dance, cannot be maintained. The pleasure given by regular repetition of embroidery designs, painting, or the complex arrangement of strings in rhythmically repeated order cannot be explained by conditions imposed by the technique, and there is no indication that this rhythm is later than the one determined by motor habits.</p><p>
In primitive music we find numerous songs in which the melody is carried solely by vocables, like our la-la-la in songs the words of which are not familiar to us, or in the frequent refrains. The musical elements of such songs are solely tune and rhythm. Sometimes the vocable itself may have a significance indicating a certain emotion or situation. Such are the vocables of wails or those suggesting the cries of animals or of definite spirits. In other cases the song may be interspersed with a single word here and there, like an outcry adjusted to the regular course of the tune, while the rest is carried on by vocables. In many cases the words, even when forming continuous sentences, are distorted by lengthening or abbreviation â€” an extended use of the method we employ in using the apostrophe, wrong accents, or extraordinary lengthening in order to fit words to a tune. This, however, is not always the case. In recitations and chants the words are often controlling, and musical phrases are added or omitted when the words require it. In the music of the Dakota Indian we find both tendencies, the words adapted to the tunes and the tunes adapted to the words. 12</p><p>
The contents of poetry are as varied as the cultural interests of the people. It is difficult for us to appreciate the poetic value they may have for the composer or singer, since the contents may have no emotional appeal to us. When the Eskimo women sing, " Our husbands are coming down there, I am going to eat!" it may sound utterly prosaic to us who do not know the privations of Eskimo life, and it may well be that the combined joy of seeing the safe return of the men from the dangers of the chase and the prospect of a jolly evening when all the people are assembled over the meal and are joking and conversing finds exuberant relief in these insignificant lines. The effect of poetry does not depend upon the power of description that releases clear and beautiful images, but upon its ability to arouse strong emotion.</p><p>
As we may underestimate the poetic value of such trifling songs, we may easily overestimate the actual poetic value of stereotyped</p><p>
symbolic poetry that appeals to us on account of its strange imagery, but that may have to the native no other than the emotional appeal of the ritual.</p><p>
When the occasions of singing are varied we find commonly distinctive types of song for every one of these. Thus the Kwakiutl Indians of Vancouver Island have children's songs which father or mother sings, letting the child dance on the arms; love songs, generally sung in chorus by the young men walking up and down the street; feast songs praising the greatness of the host; war songs; and various types of ritual songs sung in their religious ceremonials. The types are clearly distinct and easily recognizable. They are built on a common principle, but each has its own style.</p><p>
While the style of songs may be defined by a study of their rfeythm and melody, it is much more difficult to define the style of prose â€” even setting aside the paucity of reliable material. The style depends to a great extent upon linguistic form. What may be appealing in one language may be repellent in one of different form. Thus the structure of many American languages compels the narrator to express himself explicitly in regard to the location where an event happens while other languages remain vague in regard to this point. To one accustomed to strict localization the latter style is lacking in color.</p><p>
The inclination to diffuse detail characterizes the style of some tales while others may strive for such pregnant conciseness that the most intimate knowledge of the culture is required to make the contents intelligible. Devices for securing emphasis are probably present everywhere. There are pathos and fun. A generalized treatment of prose style seems hardly possible.</p><p>
Certain devices may be discussed. One of these is characterization of individuals by peculiar ways of behaving or talking. The mere introduction of a trickster in a tale .arouses the expectation of some exhilarating exploit. Often he and other actors in the tale are characterized by peculiar mannerisms of speech that set them off from other personalities. The character of various animals or persons is liable to be stereotyped, and their mere introduction may call forth the expectation of events that conform to their supposed nature.</p><p>
Similes are found more often in songs and oratory than in narrative prose. Still, they are not lacking in prose. The Polynesians seem to appreciate their poetic value. Thus we read in the Fornander collection of Hawaiian tales: "His skin was like a ripe banana. His eyeballs were like the young buds of a banana. His body was straight and</p><p>
without blemish and he was without an equal/' In the Hawaiian story of Laieikawai it is said: " I am not the mistress of this shore. I came from inland, from the top of the mountain which is clothed in a white garment."</p><p>
In Indian oratory there is ample use of similes. I will confine my remarks to their use among the Kwakiutl, with whose speech forms I am familiar. Similes are used particularly when describing the greatness of a chief or of a warrior. The chief is compared with a mountain; a precipice (from which rolls down wealth overwhelming the tribe); a rock that cannot be climbed; the post of heaven (that supports the world); the only great tree (that raises its crown over the lower trees of the woods or that rises in lonely height on an island); a loaded canoe at anchor; the one who makes the whole world smoky (from the smoke of the fire in the house in which he gives feasts); the thick tree; the thick root (of the tribe). Through his great acts he burns up the tribes (relating to warlike exploits). The people follow him as the young sawbill ducks follow the mother bird. He makes the people suft'er with his short-life maker; he shoves away the tribes. The greatness of the chief is called the weight of his name. When he marries a princess he lifts her weight from the floor; his wealth of blankets (which are piled up before being distributed) is a mountain that rises through our heavens; in the feast, surrounded by his tribe, he stands on his fortress. Wealth is the salmon caught by him.</p><p>
Examples of similar kind may be found in the oratory and poetry of many peoples. They occur also commonly in sayings. The Tsim-shian of British Columbia say, "A deer, though toothless, may accomplish something."</p><p>
Allusions are also a device used particularly in oratory. The Tsim-shian, to whom I referred before, have a saying, " Is this war, father? " which refers to a story in which a boy who has been told by his father that there will be a great war, endures many hardships and asks every time this question. The Dakota Indians say, " Did you not see his palate?" referring to the striped palate of the trickster of their mythology and implying that the person referred to is unreliable and tricky. Such allusions are intelligible only to those who know the tribal lore. Therefore, they are not often found in published material. Allusions of this kind are common in African proverbs. A Lamba saying is, "The slave was redeemed through his castor-oil," referring to the story of a slave who paid for his freedom by presenting his master with oil from plants he had sowed. Another is: "It is</p><p>
an evil omen of the Nsenga. We shall question it on our return." This means that one will not be discouraged easily. It refers to the tale of a trading expedition to the Nsenga country on which many evil omens were encountered. The leader refused to be discouraged and on his return journey received satisfactory explanation of every one of them. A Djagga proverb says, "Do not cheat me like Kitiko who cheated Ivere." This refers to two men who bet that they could fast for ten days. Kitiko was fed by his wife, although he was being watched, and thus won the bet.</p><p>
There are great differences in the manner of composition. Some people have a preference for long, complex stories; among others, brief anecdotic tales prevail. On the whole the incidents of which complex stories are built up arc brief, disconnected anecdotes Vhich are woven into a whole by various devices. Often this is accomplished by concentrating all the anecdotes around one personage. When this person is given a definite character a somewhat greater unity is secured. Thus the Raven tale of Alaska consists entirely of unrelated episodes. The only connecting link, besides the identity of the hero, is the voracity of the Raven. Similar in structure are the Spider tales of Africa, the Dwarf Antelope tales of Malaysia, and the Fox tales of Europe. 21</p><p>
Sometimes the incidents are strung on the slight thread of a tale of adventure and travel. To this class belongs the Eskimo tale of a hero who follows his escaped wife and meets on the way with dangers which he overcomes â€” like the Argonauts in their search for the Golden Fleece. Similar is the structure of the migration legends of the Creek and Pueblo. An interesting case is that of a modern tale of the Tlingit of Alaska. In the early days of Russian colonization of Alaska the Tlingit attacked the fort of Sitka. The governor, Baranoff, had to flee. After a few years he returned and reestablished the fort. This interval is filled by the Tlingit with a marvelous story, telling how he went in search of his son. He encounters fabulous beings that are known from other tales, visits the entrance of the lower world, and communicates with the souls of the deceased.</p><p>
There are also tales in which the incidents are brought into closer inner connection. The creation legends of the Polynesians are of this character, as are their war histories, the incidents of which are held together by a single plot or a single purpose. As an example we may give the abstract of the origin story of the Baganda, a simple case of a connected story.</p><p>
The first ancestor of the people, Kintu, arrived in Uganda and brought with him a cow. There was no other food in the country. A heavenly woman came down with her brother and wished to marry him. Her father, the Lord of Heaven, objected to the marriage on account of Kintu's poverty. In order to test Kintu's powers he stole his cow. The girl told him of the whereabouts of his cow and took him up to the sky, where he saw multitudes of houses, people, cattle, goats, sheep, and fowl. Kintu had to show his powers by being subjected to a number of tests. He had to eat large quantities of food, split a rock with a copper axe, and find his cow and her calves among a large herd. Finally he was accepted and sent back with the herds of the young woman. He was warned not to take her brother, Death, along? Owing to a mistake made by his wife, Death accompanied him, and thus death was introduced in the world. An attempt of another brother to have Death go back to Heaven failed.</p><p>
Similar well-integrated stories are also found among other tribes, even those of simpler structure than the Baganda. Thus the Eskimo have a tale belonging to the Swan Maiden type. A youth surprises some bird girls bathing, takes away the dress of one, and marries her. Eventually she recovers her dress and flies away with her son to the land of the birds beyond the hole of the sky. He follows her, and the obstacles and dangers of the way to the sky fill the larger part of the story, which ends with the finding of the wife.</p><p>
The literary forms of the world are not uniform. We may observe that a number of extended areas have peculiar characteristics. Certain literary forms are found among all the races of the Old World while they are unknown in America. The important position held by the proverb in the literature of Africa, Asia, and also of Europe until quite recent times is well known. In Africa particularly the proverb is in constant use. It is even the basis of court decisions. The importance of the proverb in Europe is illustrated by the way in which Sancho Panza applies it. Equally rich is Asiatic literature in proverbial sayings. On the contrary, hardly any proverbial sayings are known from American Indians.</p><p>
The same conditions are found in regard to the riddle, one of the favorite pastimes of the Old World, which is almost entirely absent in America. Riddles are known from the Yukon River, a region in which Asiatic influences may be discovered in several cultural traits, and from the Eskimo of Labrador. In other parts of the continent careful questioning has failed to reveal their occurrence. It is striking</p><p>
that even in New Mexico and Arizona, where Indians and Spaniards have been living side by side for several centuries and where Indian literature is full of Spanish elements, the riddle, nevertheless, has not been adopted, although the Spaniards of this region are as fond of riddles as those of Europe.*</p><p>
The distribution of epic poetry is also wide, but nevertheless limited to a fairly definitely circumscribed area â€” namely, Europe and a considerable part of central Asia. We know in America long, connected tribal traditions, but up to this time no trace of a composition that might be called a romance or a true epic poem has ever been discovered. Polynesian legends telling of the descent and deeds of their chiefs may perhaps be designated as epic poetry. The distribution of this form can be understood only on the basis \)f the existence of ancient cultural relations.</p><p>
On the ground of the distribution of these types two conclusions may be established: the one that these forms are not necessary steps in the development of literary form, but that they occur only under certain conditions; the other that the forms are not determined by race, but depend upon historical happenings.</p><p>
If at the time when Europeans first came to the New World the literature of the Americans did not possess the three types of literature we mentioned, it does not follow that they would have appeared at a later time. We have no reason to assume that American literature was less developed than that of Africa. On the contrary, the art of narrative and poetry is highly developed in many parts of America. We must rather assume that the historical conditions have led to a form different from that of the Old World.</p><p>
The distribution of these forms among Europeans, Mongols, Malays, and Negroes proves the independence of literary development from racial descent. It shows that it is one of the characteristics of the enormously extended cultural area which embraces almost the whole of the Old World and which in other features also appears in distinct contrast to the New W T orld. I mention here only the development of a formal judicial procedure, founded on the taking of evidence, the oath, and the ordeal, and the absence of this complex in America; and also the rarity in America of the belief in obsession and the evil eye, and of the use of artificial amulets, which are widely known in the Old World. These conclusions are much strengthened by the study of the literature of more restricted areas. The investigation of European fairy tales has led to the conclusion that in contents and form they embrace many survivals of past times. Not only Grimm's theories but also Gomme's views are based on this opinion. It is quite evident that the modern European fairy tales do not reflect the political conditions of our times, nor the conditions of our daily life, but that they give us an imaginative picture of rural life in semifeudal times, and that, owing to the contradictions between modern intellectualism and the ancient rural tradition, conflicts of viewpoints occur that may be interpreted as survivals. In tales of primitive people it is otherwise. A detailed analysis of the traditional tales of a number of Indian tribes shows complete agreement of the conditions of life with those that may be abstracted from the tales. Beliefs and customs in life and in tales are in full agreement. This is true not only of old native material but also of imported stories that were borrowed some time ago. They are quickly adapted to the prevailing mode of life. The analysis of tales from the Northwest Coast and from the Pueblos gives the same result. Only during the period of transition to new modes of life, such as are brought about by contact with Europeans, do contradictions develop. Thus it happens that in the talcs of Laguna, one of the Pueblos of New Mexico, the visitor always enters through the roof of the house, although the modern houses have doors. The headman of the ceremonial organization plays an important role in many tales, although the organization itself has largely disappeared. The tales of the Plains Indians still tell of buffalo hunts, although the game has disappeared and the people have become tillers of the soil and laborers.</p><p>
It would be erroneous to assume that the absence of survivals of an earlier time can be explained as due to the permanence of conditions, to a lack of historical change. Primitive culture is a product of historical development no less than modern civilization. Mode of life, customs, and beliefs of primitive tribes are not stable; but the rate of change, unless disturbances from the outside occur, is slower than among ourselves. What is lacking is the pronounced social stratification of our times that brings it about that the various groups represent, as it were, different periods of development. So far as my knowledge goes we find the cultural, formal background of the art of narrative of primitive people almost entirely determined by its present cultural state. The only exceptions are found in periods of</p><p>
an unusually rapid change or of disintegration. However, in this case also a readjustment occurs. Thus the stories of the modern Negroes of Angola reflect the mixed culture of the West African coast. In the cultural background of the narrative, survivals do not play an important role, at least not under normal conditions. The plot may be old, but it undergoes radical changes.</p><p>
These remarks relating to literature do not mean, of course, that in other aspects of life ancient customs and beliefs may not persist over long periods.</p><p>
The general cultural outlook is felt also in the fundamental plots of the stories. For example, in the tales of the North American Indians the conception of the relation of man to the supernatural powers is entirely different from the conception that is characteristic of Siberian tribes. The Indian seeks the spirits that are to help him, or at least encourages their coming. The Siberian is seized by the powers, no matter whether he wants them or not. Even among American tribes there are striking differences that color their tales. In one group the powers are supplicated, and they grant their gift in response to the prayer; in others they are coerced to bestow their gifts.</p><p>
Instructive examples of the influence of culture upon the elaboration of themes are found in tales borrowed from Europe. In a nativity story of the Zuni of New Mexico, recorded by Dr. Benedict and Dr. Parsons, Jesus appears as a girl, the daughter of the sun. After the birth of the child the domestic animals pay homage by licking it; only the mule refuses, and it is punished by sterility. The whole story has been given a new aspect. It is made to account for fertility, a thought uppermost in the minds of the Pueblos. Changes in the mythological significance of tales will be treated in the chapter on mythology.</p><p>
The differences of cultural life which are reflected in literature have a far-reaching effect not only upon the contents but also upon the form of the narrative. The motives of action are determined by the mode of life and the chief interests of the people, and the plots give us a picture of these.</p><p>
In many typical tales of the Chukchee of Siberia the subject of the tale is the tyranny and overmastering arrogance of an athletic hunter or warrior and the attempts of the villagers to free themselves. Among the Eskimo a group of brothers often take the place of the village bully. Among both groups of people who live in small settlements, without any hard and fast political organization, the</p><p>
fear of the strongest person plays an important role, no matter whether his power is founded on bodily strength or on supposed supernatural qualities. The story uses generally a weak, despised boy as savior of the community. Although tales of overbearing chiefs do occur among the Indians, they are not by any means a predominant type.</p><p>
The principal theme of the Indians of British Columbia, whose thoughts are almost entirely taken up by the wish to obtain rank and high position in their community, is the tale of a poor man who attains high position, or that of the struggles between two chiefs who try to outdo each other in feats that will increase their social standing. Among the Blackfoot the principal theme is the acquisition of ceremonies, possession and practice of which is a most important element in their lives.</p><p>
The differences of cultural life also influence the form of the narrative, because the incidents are tied together in different ways. The same motive recurs repeatedly in the tales of primitive people, so that a large mass of material collected from the same tribe is liable to be very monotonous, and after a certain point has been reached we obtain only new variants of old themes.</p><p>
Ahtsic. We have discussed the phenomena of rhythm in connection with song. It remains to describe the general characteristics of melody, polyphony, and musical instruments.</p><p>
The all-important element of music is tonality, the use of fixed intervals that may be transposed from one point of the tone series to another and which are always recognized as equivalent. There is a certain similarity between the tonality of music and the tonality of language. Many languages, like Chinese, many African, and many American languages, give to their vowels or to syllabic consonants different values according to their pitch. This is not absolutely fixed, but the relative intervals between tones are maintained. Dr. George Herzog has shown that parts of the songs of the Navajo and West Africans, whose languages have pitch, are musical renderings of the natural pitch of the spoken phrases. That means that the tones are held more constant and the changes of absolute pitch that occur in conversation are avoided. On this basis the Africans have developed a drum language in w r hich the different tones produced by striking the middle or rim of the drum imitate the pitch-sequence and rhythm of words. These are understood. In these cases the melody is derived from the melody of speech. Herbert Spencer suggests that this is</p><p>
the origin of all melody, but it seems doubtful whether it explains the origin of the consistent tonality of a song which is not characteristic of fluent speech in which intervals and absolute pitch vary with emotional tone. This theory would also presuppose either that by origin all languages had fixed pitch, or that all music originated among a people that had pitch language. Since the origin of pitch is often secondary we can hardly assume that it was a trait common to all the earliest languages? Carl Stumpf is of the opinion that the sustained cry has been the most important element in the development of music, because it used fixed intervals and stable tones* Whatever the origin of music may have been, we must recognize the existence of fixed intervals and transponibility as fundamental requirements of all music.</p><p>
Many primitive tribes have no musical instruments except those used for expressing rhythm. The tonality is carried exclusively by the human voice. Sometimes the range of the melodies is a few tones, as among the Chukchee; sometimes it extends over more than an octave.</p><p>
The selection of tones used presents difficult problems. Ordinarily, to the untrained ear, the octave appears as a single tone and the tones of the song stand in definite relation to the octave. The octave may be divided according to overtones in a harmonic series, or it may be subdivided in equidistant intervals. The fifth is found often as a harmonic interval, but a neutral third which divides the fifth in two equal parts may also be observed. On account of the uncertainty of intonation of the untrained singer and the lack of exactly constructed instruments among primitive people, it is difficult to decide what they want to sing, particularly since intervals vary with the degree of emotional excitement of the singers. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the definite tonal character of each musical phrase stands out distinctly.</p><p>
The musical systems of eastern Asia prove that our system is not by any means the only possible one. The Javanese, for instance, divide their octave into five, the Siamese into seven, equidistant steps, while we have made an adjustment of the harmonic scale by dividing the octave into twelve equal intervals.</p><p>
The universal use of instruments that accent rhythm has been mentioned. While rhythm may be indicated by hand-clapping or stamping, there are commonly instruments in use that give a fuller sound. These may be simply sticks with which resounding objects,</p><p>
like boards, are beaten. More complex are drums â€” wooden boxes, or much more commonly hoops or hollow cylinders, covered on one or both sides with a drumhead of skin; notched sticks which are pulled over the edges of hollow vessels, producing a rasping sound; rattles of varying form, either hollow receptacles containing pebbles or seeds which when shaken produce a rattling sound, or objects like loose deer hoofs which are shaken and produce sounds when striking one another. Drums give different tones according to the way they are struck and the tension of the skins. Where skins are used, the drums are no longer employed solely for marking rhythm, but support melody. This is still more the case in those drums that consist of a hollowed log one side of which has a long slit into which two tongues of different lengths are inserted. When struck they produce different tones. The gongs of southern Asia and the xylophone of Africa are also percussion instruments, but they are accurately tuned and are used not only for marking rhythm but also for melodic purposes. A curious intermediate position is occupied by an instrument used in New Ireland, consisting of a block of wood, one side of which is carefully leveled and divided by deep curved notches into a number of sections. By rubbing over these or striking them different tones are produced (see Fig. 46, p. 248).</p><p>
Wind instruments are not as widely distributed as percussion instruments. Their simplest forms are probably calls used by the hunter and warrior. Others are employed for ceremonial purposes. Large shells, horns of animals, and hollowed tusks are used. These have only a single tone. When made of wood, lip pipes and reed pipes are found. More complicated are flutes and flageolets provided with stops which allow the playing of melodies. The ordinary forms are similar to our instruments, but others, blown with the nose, occur in the Pacific island area. In the Pandean pipe of Asia, Europe, the Pacific islands, and South America a number of pipes, each of one tone, are tied together in a line so that they can be blown in any desired order.</p><p>
Before the advent of the Europeans in America, string instruments were entirely confined to the Old World. Since the tone of the vibrating string is weak, all these instruments are provided with a resonance chamber. This invention does not belong to string instruments exclusively, for it is also inherent in the construction of cylindrical and box drums and in the so-called water drums, in which the body of the drum is partly immersed in water. It is also used with the xylophone.</p><p>
The simplest string instrument is the musical bow. In some forms a broadened part of the string is held in front of the mouth, which serves as a resonance chamber;* in others a hollow receptacle, such as a gourd, is attached to the middle of the bow stave. The string is pulled or struck with one hand, and its length is varied with the other. The harp and lyre are still widely distributed in Africa.f A hybrid between xylophone and string instruments is the African zanza, which consists of iron strips of varying length stretched over a resonance box provided with a bridge. These are pulled at their ends like strings. Instruments of the type of our violin do not seem to occur among primitive people.</p><p>
With the use of instruments capable of producing melodies we find also instrumental music without song, or accompanying song.* Thus, the American Indian plays tunes on his flageolet. Polyphony received a strong stimulus by the development of instrumental music. Polyph-onous singing has already been referred to.</p><p>
Dance. Almost all singing is accompanied by movements of the body. The clapping of hands and stamping of feet accentuate the rhythm, but other parts of the body are in motion too. Trunk and head sway, and arms are swung even without hand-clapping; in short, simple dance movements are a common accompaniment of song. In every region they have their own style. The Eskimo drummer holds his drum at about the height of his head and bends the body from side to side. Among some tribes the singer dances; often his singing accompanies the dance of others. On the Northwest Coast of America the singers sit still and beat time while one or a few individuals dance; in certain dances of the Pueblo Indians a chorus sings and the dance is often performed by large groups moving in formation. The style of body movement is also typical for each area. Polynesian singers are seated and swing their bodies; Northwest Coast Indians dance bending their knees with each step and holding their palms forward and trembling at about the height of the head. A characterization of styles of dancing and a description of their distribution cannot be given, because too little is known about this subject. Joint dances of the two sexes are rare, and dancers do not often so move that their bodies are in close contact.</p><p>
Symbolic or descriptive movements akin to gestures accompanying speech appear with dance movements. Thus the chorus of the Indians of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico sing: In the east rises the sun youth.</p><p>
Here westward he moves with life and vegetation,</p><p>
Carrying them in his basket while walking along.</p><p>
When this song is sung the dancers are drawn up in formation and perform their steps and movements in rhythmic accord with the song. The singers stand in a close group around the drummer and accompany their song with gestures. First they face west and move a step forward. The word "vegetation" is expressed by pushing the hands alternately upward, symbolizing the growing corn. The word "basket" is designated by describing a wide circle with both hands and bringing them together in front of the body. "Walking" is indicated by stretching the hands out forward in front of the body and waving them up and down.</p><p>
The Kwakiutl sing as follows:</p><p>
I am going around the world eating everywhere with the Cannibal</p><p>
spirit. I went to the center of the world; the Cannibal spirit is crying "food."</p><p>
The singers beat time, but the dancer accompanies the song with descriptive movements. With the words "I am going," the arms are stretched out to one side; with "around the world," they swing around in a wide circle; with "I," the shoulders are brought alternately forward and backward; with "eating everywhere," the right hand is stretched far out as though taking food, and then brought to the mouth while the left describes a wide circle indicating "everywhere"; with "Cannibal spirit," both hands are bent inward and the finger tips are moved toward the mouth. In the second line, after making the sign indicating the Cannibal spirit, the arms are stretched far back, palms down, and the head is lowered. This is the position of the Cannibal when he utters his terrifying cry "ham" (that is, "food"). When the words "the center of the world" are sung, the dancer looks at the middle of the rear of the house in the attitude of the Cannibal, the rear of the house symbolizing the center of the world.</p><p>
The last example shows the close association between dance and pantomime. As the cannibal dancer represents by movements the ideas that are expressed in the song, so the artistic aim of the performance is often the mimic representation of some impressive experience or event. To this class belong the numerous examples of animal dances. In New Guinea a dance has been observed imitating the woo-</p><p>
ing of a hen by a rooster, including the battle between two rival roosters. The Indians of the Southwest impersonate in their dances flying eagles. The Fijians are even said to have performed a group dance imitating the surf of the ocean. In still other cases the dance movements become subordinate to the pantomimic representation. Thus the Indians of British Columbia represent the contents of their myths and family histories. An artificial whale made of wood may be seen to rise from the water and to bring back the ancestor who has had a supernatural experience at the bottom of the sea. The impressiveness of mimic dances is increased by the use of imitative masks and dresses.</p><p>
On account of the intense emotional value of music and dance they enter into all those social situations which imply heightened effects, and in their turn they call forth intense emotional reaction. Thus it is that war and religion offer numerous situations which are accompanied by music and dance, which are in part an expression of the excitement inherent in the situation, in part a means of exciting the passions. It would be an error to assume that the sources of music and dance must be looked for in these situations. It seems more likely that they share with other ethnic phenomena, particularly religion, the tendency to associate themselves with all those activities that give rise to emotional states similar to those of which they themselves are expressions.</p><p>

CHAPTER XIII</p><p>
MYTHOLOGY AND FOLKLORE FRANZ BOAS</p><p>
Myth and folk tale. It is impossible to draw a sharp line between myths and folk tales, because the same tales which occur as myths appear also in the form of folk tales. If we define myths as tales that give an interpretation of natural phenomena, we are confronted with the difficulty that a tale may conform with this definition in one case, while in another it may be a purely human tale, sometimes even void of wonderful elements. Thus the same tale would at one time be classed as a myth, and at another time as a folk tale.</p><p>
If we take as the basis of our definition the personification of animals, plants, heavenly bodies, and natural phenomena, another difficulty arises, for such personifications appear also in folk tales that are purely imaginative or even considered as true events that have happened to contemporaries.</p><p>
The reference to religious ideas and rituals does not constitute a useful criterion either, for these may enter into myths as well as into folk tales relating to recent occurrences.</p><p>
Mythological concepts. Definition of mythological concepts is much easier than definition of mythological tales. Mythological concepts are the fundamental views of the constitution of the world and of its origin. These enter into tales relating to incidents in the lives of mythical beings, and into folk tales referring to the exploits and sufferings of our contemporaries, often of known individuals. Thus the African tells of encounters with ancestral ghosts and of the misdeeds of witches; the Koryak shaman recounts his fights with evil spirits; the European relates the incidents of the lives of the saints and dealings with the devil; the Oriental listens to stories of demons controlled by magic rings, and the American Indian to visits to the land of the ghosts. In all these legends the mythological concepts appear as part and parcel of the tales. 1</p><p>
It is fairly clear that stories are unhesitatingly classed as myths if they account for the origin of the world and if they may be said to</p><p>
have happened in a mythical period, different from the one in which we live now. The difference is clearly recognized by many tribes, like the North American Indians, the Andaman Islanders, and the Australians.</p><p>
Origin of tales. In a treatment of tales the question whether they are myths or folk tales may be disregarded. The problem relates rather to the elucidation of the history and origin of tales, and to the question how and to what extent mythical concepts become the principal subject of tales. The significance of Hesiod's account of the history of the gods is obviously different from that of the deeds and sufferings of Odysseus.</p><p>
We shall first of all consider the question of the origin of tales. In an Inquiry for which no record of past times is available we must try to establish the processes that are active at the present time and see whether they may help us in an attempt to reconstruct the past. There is no reason for assuming that the same processes should not have been active in earlier times, at least as long as the types of culture conformed to the standards of modern primitive tribes. This has certainly been the case ever since the later part of the Paleolithic period, for the remains of modern primitives found after thousands of years would conform strictly to the level indicated by the remains of these early times.</p><p>
An analysis of folk tales shows that they deal almost throughout with events that may occur in human society, with human passions, virtues, and vices. Sometimes the events are quite plausible, but more often they are fantastic and of such a character that they cannot have had their origin in human experience, but may be understood as the results of the play of imagination with everyday experience. The products of imagination are not simply reproductions of sense-experiences, although they are built of them. They are the result of daydreams that play with them, and of their emotional tone. We are filled with an ardent desire, and our imagination lets us see our wish fulfilled, no matter how impossible it may be. An event strikes us with wonder, and in our imagination the wonderful elements will be exaggerated. We are threatened with danger, and the cause of danger may appear to us endowed with extraordinary powers. In all these situations the actual experience may be exaggerated or turned into its opposite, and the impossible will be realized.</p><p>
After the death of a dear friend neither we. nor primitive people speculate as to what may have become of his soul; but we feel the</p><p>
MYTHOLOGY AND FOLKLORE 611</p><p>
ardent desire to undo what has happened, and in the free play of fancy we see the dead come back to life. The slain leader in battle whose dismembered body is found is restored to full vigor. The warrior surrounded by enemies, when all means of retreat are cut off, will wish to pass unseen through the ranks of the foe, and in a strong imagination the wish will become a reality.</p><p>
Other mythic forms may be understood as exaggerations of experiences. Thus the beauty of form of the human body may transcend the realm of reality. The shining youths with resplendent hair may thus be understood. Deformations of the body also supply the imagination with material. Monstrosities that cannot survive are assumed to live and to become a source of danger. Wrinkles, moles, warts, supernumerary limbs, discolorations, are all elemente from which the play of imagination may build its figures.</p><p>
The very fact that these experiences and situations occur in every human society and that the psychological stimulus for imaginative transformations is present everywhere is sufficient to explain the general similarity of many fantastic figures and happenings in folk tales.</p><p>
Mythology and folklore cannot be understood solely from the point of view of a primitive philosophy, as the result of speculative thought about the origin and structure of the world and of human life. It is no less an outflow of artistic, more specifically literary activity. The one-sided emphasis laid upon the intimate relation between religion and mythology obscures the imaginative play that is involved in the formation of myths.</p><p>
Folk tales must be considered as analogous to modern novelistic literature. The attempt which has often been made to refer all of them to phenomena of nature, to the moon or sun, does not take into consideration the actual play of imagination that is common to mankind the world over. It is not necessary to identify a person who is covered with warts with the moon, on account of the suggestive shadows oh her surface; or to assume that the cutting up or swallowing of a hero's body represents the waning of the moon. The elaborate theories of psychoanalysis seem also unnecessary for the purpose of explaining the wonderful elements of folk tales or of mythological figures. The free play of imagination operating with everyday experiences is sufficient to account for their origin. The vocabulary and grammar of languages of primitive tribes possess forms, that express " if I could," " if I were," " if this had not happened," and others that</p><p>
can be understood only as the expression of imaginative happenings. Equally clear evidence of the importance of imaginative thought are the numerous similes and metaphorical expressions in the languages of primitive tribes. There is no need to search for the origin of metaphor when actually the vocabulary of every language proves that the process of restriction, expansion, and transfer of meaning is constantly at work shaping and reshaping the significance of word symbols. Every transfer of meaning may become the stimulus for metaphoric use, if it is not itself a metaphor.</p><p>
For these reasons it does not seem necessary to search in nature for prototypes of beings endowed with extraordinary qualities and of events that are exaggerations or distortions of what happens in everyday life. These are material from which tales and many mythological concepts are built.</p><p>
Dissemination of talcs. A study of tales as they are now found gives very slight evidence of the ability of man to invent new motives. It seems rather that his imagination is restricted by the current forms of tales.</p><p>
The similarity of tales found in many parts of the world has given rise to prolonged discussion. While Tylor, Brinton, and other early investigators were inclined to see in these correspondences evidence of a psychic unity of mankind, and assumed that each one of the analogous stories had an independent origin wherever told, careful investigation of the distribution and recent spread of talcs has proved that in most cases the occurrence of similar tales is due to dissemination. This has been shown most satisfactorily for European and Asiatic folk tales and for those of North America. The place of origin of each tale cannot be ascertained, but the lines along which it traveled may be traced. In Europe and Asia literature was a powerful means of spreading tales; in America the large continuous areas of distribution of certain tales are ample evidence of their common origin. This evidence is corroborated by the spread of European tales imported into the continent after the arrival of the Spaniards and Portuguese. French stories are widely known among the Indian tribes of North America. Spanish tales are found even in the remote, unexplored forests of the Amazon basin. 10</p><p>
A few complex stories consisting of a sequence of unrelated elements have an exceedingly wide distribution. Perhaps the most convincing one of these is that of the Magic Flight, the outstanding elements of which are the flight from an ogre, and objects thrown back over the shoulder forming obstacles â€” a stone which becomes a mountain; a comb which becomes a thicket; oil which becomes a body of water. The tale is known from the Atlantic border of Europe eastward over Asia and North America, reaching the Atlantic coast in Greenland. It is hardly conceivable that such a group of unrelated incidents should arise independently in regions far apart. The continuous area over which the tale is distributed also indicates that it was carried from people to people, from tribe to tribe. Thus it is possible to trace with a high degree of probability the historically determined distribution of complex tales,</p><p>
Origin of elements of tales. The same method cannot be pursued when irregularly distributed elements of tales are concerned. Their occurrence has been used to prove that they must arise not only from the similar working of the mind among all races, but from a deep-seated tendency to express the ever-recurring phenomena of nature in the same imaginative terms. It is true that the moon appears the same, that she waxes and wanes all over the world, but this does not prove that every tale of a disfigured face or of growth and decline, of being swallowed up or killed and being reborn, must refer to the moon, for there are endless other experiences in human life that suggest the same group of ideas. Nor is it necessary to claim that every ferocious snake must be the lightning, and that every shining youth must be the sun.</p><p>
One of the widely distributed elements is that of the swallowed person or animal who regains freedom and, as a frequent incident, loses his hair by the heat in the body of the swallowing monster. It is familiar to us from the stories of Jonah and the Leviathan and of our Tom Thumb. The actual swallowing of a whole animal may be observed in the feeding habits of snakes. The birth of young animals suggests the possibility of naked living beings coming out of the body of a larger animal. Added to this are the curious feelings of bodies moving in the stomach and intestines in cases of indigestion, and the noises produced by gases that lead to the idea of animals infesting the body, of which the patient ultimately rids himself. Such observations may well have stimulated the imagination and given rise to the theme of swallowed animals, without having resort to the far-fetched idea that in every case this animal must be the moon. It is not claimed that this must be the only origin of the tale. It is merely intended to show that there are human experiences that furnish all the elements. It is also interesting to note that notwithstanding the accurate knowl-</p><p>
edge of the anatomy of animals the most fanciful distortions appear. The swallowed animal reaches up to the heart and cuts it off. It slides straight through the alimentary canal of the monster â€” like the piece of bacon attached by Miinchhausen to a fishline which was swallowed by one duck after another. The monster is so huge that whole tribes camp in its stomach, and its breath is so strong that it inhales whatever approaches it.</p><p>
Another example of widely and irregularly distributed incidents is the ascent to heaven by means of a chain of arrows. Visits to the skyland are probably universal, but the methods of ascent differ. Of course, nobody has ever seen a chain of arrows that can be climbed, but it seems entirely within the reach of imagination to extend the the game of hitting the notch of an arrow with a second one to develop an idea of this kind. It cannot be denied that the rays of the sun shining through the clouds in a moist atmosphere may have helped to develop the idea.</p><p>
It does not seem plausible that all incidents of the class here referred to are immediate reflexes of natural phenomena that suggested the tales, for those explainable as a play of imagination with the events of human life are far too numerous. It seems most likely that the imagination of the storytellers transferred these elements to the anthropomorphized natural phenomena which were thus drawn into the circle of human society.</p><p>
After a mythology of this kind had developed and in course of time lost its vigor and meaning, it may well have disintegrated again and become the subject matter of folk tales. Thus Grimm derived the story of the Sleeping Beauty surrounded by an impenetrable hedge of thorns from the fire surrounding the rock of the sleeping Valkyrie. 13</p><p>
Character of mythological concepts. The most important characteristic of mythological concepts is personification. It is not difficult to understand why animals should be personified, for their behavior resembles in many ways that of man. Their actions are easily understood as motivated by hunger, fear, anger, and love. When their strength is superior to that of man and he succumbs to their attack, it is proof of their greater power that is pitted against him.</p><p>
These personified animals appear everywhere in tales. In striking contrast to the human actors, they are sharply characterized according to their observed habits. The cunning fox and the greedy, stupid wolf of European folk tales, the monkey of India, the coyote, raven, and rabbit of North America, the jaguar of South America, the turtle and spider of Africa, are types whose mental characteristics reappear in every tale. The habits of the species are concentrated in one individual. Furthermore, what happened to the one representative individual has determined the fate of all the members of the species. When in the European tale the cat and dog quarrel, this brings about eternal enmity between the two species ; when the bear pulls off his tail trying to free it from the hold of the ice, it accounts for the shortness of the tails of all bears. Stories of this kind are often told for entertainment and are not taken seriously, while at other times they are believed to account for the actual conditions of the world. Still more frequently the observed fact is given as proof of the truth of the tale.</p><p>
Actually the relation between tale and explanatory element Js very loose. Many examples show that the same tale appears with a great variety of explanatory elements and that the tale has its independent existence without any attached explanatory element. Waterman has given a list of these for North America. The elements of mythological concepts are thoughts suggested by the contents of the preexisting tale, and therefore depend upon its literary interest. It is not the story that has been added to the observation, but the observation that has been attached to the story on account of its appropriateness.</p><p>
Explanatory tales of this kind do not refer to the characteristics of animals alone. Sometimes traits of the human body or phenomena of nature are explained in the same way. Thus the occurrence of limping or of defects in bodily proportions is explained by the tale that when a mass of skeletons were revived the bones of different individuals were confused ; or it is said that wood burns because an animal running away with fire hid it in wood. 18</p><p>
The extension of the belief that will power exists in natural phenomena that interfere in the life of man is also perfectly intelligible. Destructive floods, gales, thunder storms, rock slides, are not considered as due to natural causes, but are believed to be endowed with the will to destroy. All moving objects that have any influence upon human life are thus easily viewed as endowed with human passions and human will power. Sun, moon, stars, clouds, are included in this group. If the phenomena of nature are once endowed with human qualities, it is not hard to understand why imagination should not also endow them with human form. The substitution of mythical concepts for natural phenomena is illustrated by many examples.</p><p>
Thunder is produced by the flapping of the wings, lightning by the opening of the eyes of the thunderbird; the sun is the resplendent nose ornament of the sun god; dangerous whirlpools are the home of sea monsters; spring is due to the victory of the south wind over the north wind; the earth is the mother of all vegetation or of all life, the sky the father; rivers are living persons; the rainbow carries water from the earth up to the sky. Wundt has discussed this process of personification of nature in his work on mythology. Since the phenomena of nature were considered as anthropomorphic it came about easily that novelistic tales were transferred to the domain of mythological beings.</p><p>
Myths. The mythological beings preexisted the modern order of the world. They may still appear as actors in tales relating to the modern world, but their great feats belong to a mythological period.</p><p>
It would not be fair to assume that the myths dealing with the origin of the world or of the gift of arts and ceremonials to mankind were the result of a light play of imagination, as we suppose the rather insignificant animal tales to have been. The importance of the subject matter and the seriousness with which they are treated suggest that they are the result of thought about the origin of the world and of wonder about cultural achievements and the meaning of sacred rites. The only causality known in an anthropomorphic world is the one prevailing in human society, and thus it comes about that the incidents of human life that result in achievements are transferred to the mythical beings. As man takes by force or fraud from his fellows a coveted possession, so the mythical beings overcome others and take away from them valued possessions which thus become their property and that of mankind conceived as their tribe. In other cases they may freely bestow their gifts upon their people. When offended they punish the offender. As the war leader overcomes enemies and as the fearless hunter destroys dangerous animals, so the mythical characters rid the country of giants and monsters. Like the craftsman who fashions his tools and works of art, they create man and animals or useful and beautiful objects. As the wise man plans for the future, so the mythical being plans and his thoughts become reality.</p><p>
A detailed study of mythologies shows clearly that, viewed from this angle, they reflect in detail the cultures of which they form part. The mythical beings of the Eskimo are Eskimo; those of the Australians, Australians. The chiefs of the Polynesians have their counterpart in their deities; the gods of the Dahomeans are Dahomeans; and the gods on Olympus lead the life of Greek royalty.</p><p>
One trait of the animal tale has been carried over almost consistently into mythology: the idea that what happened once has determined the fate of the world. Because a certain person died and it was decreed that he should not rise again, all men must die and remain dead, although before this death was unknown ; because the sun at one time was very hot, the high mountains are rocky and full of cracks. We may recognize the same thought in idealized form in the story of Adam and Eve. Because they disobeyed the order not to eat of the tree of knowledge all mankind is punished with them. The individual remains the representative of the species or society to which he belongs and is identified with it. 9</p><p>
Tales referring to events that result in permanent changes are more easily understood. The islands fished up from the deep by the Polynesian hero Maui are still there ; the rivers into which West Africans were transformed are still running ; the hunters who were wafted up to the sky and became stars may still be seen. 24</p><p>
The formation of myths must be so understood that the imagination applied human experiences to mythological times and then, by a reversion of order, made the mythical time the pattern on which the world and life were shaped. When in Semitic mythology God created the world, the whole world as it is now preexisted in his thought, and the creation was a process of reobjectivation of the thoughts representing man's knowledge of the world.</p><p>
The same attitude may be observed in many mythological tales which explain customs, particularly rituals. According to the tales, the customs or rituals were given to man by mythological beings who ordered the observance of a taboo or other custom, or who allowed the mortal visitor to see a ritual. The uniformity of many such rituals over large areas and the diversity of mythological explanations show clearly that the ritual itself is the stimulus for the formation of the myth. As in the Semitic creation the known world was subjectivized as the thought of God and then reobjectivated, so the known ritual was transferred to a mythical world and explained as revealed to a visitor. The ritual existed, and the tale originated from the desire to account for it.</p><p>
On account of the character of its origin the mythology of many primitive tribes consists of disconnected, often of contradictory, tales. Thus among the Eskimo the sun and moon are brother and sister ;</p><p>
but at the same time in another tale the moon is a house. Among the Tsimshian of British Columbia the Sun was kept in a box and liberated by the Haven, but he is also a man wearing a flaming mask. These contradictions are not necessarily felt as incongruous. They may be held as true by different individuals in the tribe, or the contradiction may never rise into consciousness.</p><p>
The forms of mythologies show quite consistently that systematiza-tion goes hand in hand with greater systematization of cultural life. Where political or religious organization is highly integrated, we are likely to find also integration of mythological concepts that correspond to the types of organization found in human society. The converse is even more true. When the order of social life is loose, when instead of a firm integration of social life a loose organization prevails, the mythological world corresponds to these conditions and the mythology is full of contradictions.</p><p>
Many tribes have social divisions which are analogous in their functions but sharply set off from one another. Quite commonly these divisions have myths which though specifically distinct are expressions of the same fundamental concepts and of analogous type. Examples of this kind are the tales of the totemic ancestors of the Australian Arunta, who were cut out of preexisting mythological animals and who later disappeared underground; or the origin myths of the Kwakiutl Indians, who derive their family lines from beings that came down from the sky or up from the sea in the form of animals that took off their dresses and became men. Identical mythological concepts appear also in the Kaliths of the Pelew Islands and in the ritualistic origin tales of the Blackfoot, although neither of these belongs to the mythical period. In these cases certain groups of mythological concepts are brought into order. The formal agreement of such classes of tales corresponds to a general principle, for if one social group is characterized by certain features, all others of the same kind have analogous features. If one is named, all are named; if one has certain insignia or taboos, others will be characterized also by insignia or taboos. If one has certain social duties, others are likely to have other duties.</p><p>
Effect of individual thought upon mythology. There are, however, higher levels of mythology in which the mass of mythological concepts is worked into a more harmonious unit. It would seem that this happens particularly wherever a small group of people devote much thought to ritual and mythology and where for this reason a</p><p>
systematization of concepts, sometimes also of tales, develops. In many cases the results of such speculation take on the form of esoteric knowledge guarded by a few individuals, priests or chiefs, whichever the case may be. In this manner the systematic mythologies owned by the various families of the Bella Coola developed out of the unorganized mass of myths and tales of British Columbia; in this way must have grown up the mythologies of Polynesia â€” perhaps under the influence of the highly developed mythologies of southeastern Asia.</p><p>
An example of this kind are the tales of the Andaman Islanders. Certain men are believed to have special knowledge as to the spirits and as to the magical efficacy of remedies for sickness. These are the authorities on the legendary lore of the Andamanese. Although the tales are not in any way esoteric, only certain men are regarded as having authority to speak, and in telling and retelling the tales they modify them even in important traits. It is intelligible that, if some of these men are of philosophic mind, they may adapt the current tales to phenomena of nature and reinterpret them. This is analogous to the processes of reinterpretation which are common in the development of the symbolic significance of art designs and of rituals. If Radcliffe-Brown's interpretations may be accepted, many tales have been centered around two deities representing the southwest and northeast monsoons.</p><p>
Mythologies of these types give us the "impression of being the results of philosophic thought coupled with deep emotion. They are found particularly among tribes in which a mythology of sacred character is not the property of the whole group but is in the jealously guarded keeping of a small group of priests, chiefs, or other guardians; in other words, they occur where we find an esoteric and an exoteric mythology. There is abundant proof showing that esoteric mythologies have arisen on the basis of widespread concepts.</p><p>
An excellent example is furnished by the family traditions of the Bella Coola t)f British Columbia, which are considered the exclusive sacred property of the family. The material of which these traditions consist is the same as that of neighboring tribes. Among the Kwakiutl, some distance to the south, the year is divided into a secular and a sacred season, but there is no myth connected with them. The Bella Coola say that the keepers of the sacred ceremonial live beyond the ocean and bring it at a certain time each year to this world. At the end of the season they depart with it. Among the</p><p>
Kwakiutl, animals are said to live in separate villages inland and in the sea. Among the nearer neighbors of the Bella Coola, in Rivers Inlet, all animals and plants are said to reside in one house where they perform sacred ceremonies. Among the Bella Coola this house has been lifted to the sky, and the beings living in it have assumed the functions of gods that rule over the destinies and cultural activities of man.</p><p>
Foreign elements appear also in the myths connected with sacred rituals. The myth accounting for the cannibal ceremony of the tribes just referred to is a good example. It is not an esoteric myth, but is referred to as the origin of the ceremonials. The tale contains the well-known theme of the Magic Flight, which is circumpolar in its distribution and has been woven into the complex.</p><p>
Among the Navajo the complete knowledge of an origin myth must be acquired by long training. There are only a few whom the keepers of the traditions consider competent to be taught. The material of which the whole tradition is composed is known, but the sequence and symbolic significance belong only to those who have been taught.</p><p>
In general it may be said that the patterns of ritualistic behavior are old. Their mythological explanation is fitted to the ritual according to the patterns of tribal thought. There has been frequent borrowing of myths and also of sacred rites which have been assimilated according to local conditions. Examples are the North American Sun Dance, which has fundamentally the same form everywhere, but varied explanations; the various forms of the Ghost Dance and the Mescal ceremonials, which are derived from old elements intermingled with Christian teachings; and the elaborate Melanesian rituals. -</p><p>
Esoteric and exoteric mythology. Esoteric teaching refers to rituals and is often largely based on mythological concepts. Wherever it became the exclusive charge of a small, select group of guardians, opportunity was given for a more or less conscious attempt at systematizing the heterogeneous mass of beliefs and practices current in the tribe. The thoughts of the men charged with the keeping of sacred rites are occupied with questions relating to their form and meaning. It is intelligible that in the course of generations the esoteric knowledge which its guardians had to teach to their successors increased in cohesion. It therefore seems likely that the esoteric doctrine must have been evolved on the foundation of the exoteric knowledge of the tribe and must be considered as a secondary development. It expresses the reaction of selected minds of the community to their general cultural environment. It is their attempt to systematize the ideas that underlie the culture of the community. The more or less strictly esoteric doctrine exerts its influence upon popular belief so that there is a mutual and inextricable interrelation between the two.</p><p>
The historical investigation of popular antiquities in Europe leads to analogous conclusions. While a romantic love of the early life of a nation assumed naively a spontaneous and autonomous growth of its culture from earliest times, the historical inquiry has shown that " the knowledge of the great, historical intermixtures of cultures in Europe, of the dependence of the popular elements of culture upon the 'high culture/ * as revealed in popular art, costume or in popular poetry and music, superstitions, popular medicine, etc., has shaken our belief in a purely ethnic, ' national' origin of folk culture which was the beginning of the study of folk lore and folk antiquities in almost every European country/' As an example of the complex relations between esoteric and exoteric doctrine we may refer to the divination of antiquity, the middle ages, arid modern times. The continuity of the ancient tradition and its gradual infiltration into popular belief can be proved. On the other hand, the belief in witches and the elaboration of the ideas underlying the trials of witches require for their understanding not only the traditional transmission of belief but also the current beliefs in witchcraft. The strength of the effect of popular belief upon the cultivated classes may be judged from many examples. One of these is the famous order of Ernst August, Duke of Sachse-Weimar, 1742, who ordered that wooden plates inscribed with a magic formula should be thrown into burning buildings in order to extinguish fire; another, the various magical means by which the priests extinguished fire. The resurgence of palmistry, spiritualism, and astrology at times of particular social stress shows also how readily folk beliefs are taken up by the educated and how they may be organized into systems. There is a constant give and take between the beliefs of the select, leading classes of society and the folk beliefs; and the relation between the guardians of esoteric teachings to current beliefs must be conceived in the same way.</p><p>
For this reason the esoteric teachings of the secret societies of all continents have contents which agree with the popular beliefs although they may differ in tone. In Africa we find systems of mythology based on ancestor worship. Of this kind are the Yoruban Orisha, the ancestors of every member of the extended family; and the Dahomean Tovodun, the ancestor gods. The complex system of these tribes is in part the result of a conscious coordination of distinct cults for the political purpose of unification of the states, but built on the popular beliefs of the constituent elements. The east Polynesian genealogies are no less built on the popular belief in the divinity of the chiefs. The modern American cults, like the Ghost Dance religion, the Shakers of the Pacific coast, and the Peyote cult are built on ancient tradition mixed with Christian teaching.</p><p>
Relation of mythology to other aspects of culture. If it is true that myths are built on the experiences of everyday life, we may expect that the dominant cultural interests are reflected in them. The incidents mirror the life of the people and their occupations, and social life may in part be reconstructed from these tales. Only when a rapid change of culture occurs may the tales refer to earlier conditions, as in the fairy tales of Europe, or in the tales of those primitive tribes that are in process of Europeanization.</p><p>
The influence of cultural life is not restricted to this field but appears also in the manifold forms of cultural concepts. The emphasis upon the space relations among the Pueblo Indians is an example. The four points of the compass, the above and below, are to them of greatest importance, and the mythological world is divided up according to these ideas. The importance of the southwest and northeast winds in the mythology of the Andaman Islanders has been referred to before. The Omaha have a division of sky, the male, and earth, the female. The Winnebago distinguish between the heavens, the sky, earth, the water, and the world under the waters. The Eskimo have one or two worlds above, our world, and one or two worlds below. The Polynesians believe in an order of worlds, one over the other, which are at the same time considered as representing a genealogical sequence. Local concepts of the Kwakiutl are of different character. The ancestors and supernatural beings have their homes in the sky, or in the sea. West, beyond the ocean, is the home of the salmon; upstream along the coast (that is, northward) that of copper; inland the house of the land animals, who live in villages; underground the land of the ghosts.</p><p>
A similar variety of ideas is found in regard to time concepts. The frequent occurrence of a mythical age preceding the modern age has been mentioned as one of the fundamental characteristics of mythologies. In some cases the line between these two ages is not sharply drawn. This is particularly true in Africa. The idea is clearly developed in the highly organized states of West Africa. Other tribes, like the Bafiote, Pangwe, Bushongo, and Barotse tell of a deity Nsambi, Chembe, or Nyambe, as he is called among the various tribes, who lived on earth but retired from mankind on account of their importunities. The Bafiote follow'this with a story of an ancestor who brought the fire and, migrating with his children, gave fertility to the earth wherever he went. Many of the innumerable African animal stories can hardly be considered as mythical, but are analogous to the European animal tales. Others, like the widespread African tale of the origin of death due to the stowness of the chameleon or some other animal who was sent to announce that man should be immortal but was overtaken by the lizard who brought the opposite message, are of a more serious character, being based on actions of a deity and belonging more or less clearly to a mythological period. At the same time the high development of ancestor worship which transforms the immediate ancestors into mythical beings disturbs the concept of a mythical period. In North America we find both the concepts of a mythical past and that of a future when the mythical beings will return and bring happiness to mankind. Thus it is said that the "Old Man" and Coyote of the Thompson Indians will come back from their retirement and bring back the shades of the Indians. 55</p><p>
Each particular mythology has its own character according to the cultural interests of the tribe. In some regions the problem of creation is foremost in the minds of the people, while others do not trouble themselves about this question but assume heaven, earth, sun, and moon as without beginning or end, while they may have thoughts about the creation of man and of animals. Instead of a creation we may hear about transformation of a preexisting world into its present shape, a work generally achieved by a culture hero who makes the world habitable by killing monsters and by giving man his arts and rituals.</p><p>
When we find complex tales that are interpreted by the native or may be interpreted by the student as explanations of natural phenomena, it is always necessary to ask whether we are dealing with a preexisting human story which is symbolically applied to phenomena of nature. The numerous and varying interpretations of the same stories prove that the tendency exists of using stories for the purpose of explaining phenomena of nature.</p><p>
</p><p>
CHAPTER XV</p><p>
METHODS OF RESEARCH FRANZ BOAS</p><p>
The attempts to explain ethnic phenomena by analogy with those of other sciences appear to be an expression of the helplessness of the investigator, of whom the development of a rigid method of handling his problems is demanded. Herbert Spencer based his system on the analogy between society and an organism. This analogy was still more rigidly worked out by A. Schaffle. Later on, stimulated by biological observations and hypotheses, the analogy between ethnic phenomena and organic recapitulation of phylogcny in ontogeny became a favorite theme of theorists who sought in the development of the child a repetition of the development of the race, and tried to explain child psychology on the basis of a constructed history of human culture and vice versa. This is largely the basis of certain investigations of developmental psychology. At present the peculiar customs of many primitive people which remind us of actions of the mentally deranged arc being made use of to explain ethnic phenomena of perfectly healthy groups of primitive man. The doubtful â€” in my opinion fanciful â€” interpretations of psychoanalysis are transferred to the domain of primitive life although conflicts in alien cultures may be based on social conditions entirely distinct from our own. Such analogies seem to me entirely! misleading. We must rather attempt to investigate primitive life purely objectively.</p><p>
It must be asked what are the data that may be secured and what are our objectives.</p><p>
For a long time conditions were such that we had to find first of all a standard by which the activities of members of alien cultures could be described. In other words, the handicrafts, economic conditions, beliefs, and practices of primitive people had to be described according to general observations and information received by the observer. The individual was unimportant compared with the general standards of culture. Even in books describing the characteristics of European or Asiatic peoples there is a clear tendency to isolate</p><p>
from out of the mass of varying individual behavior that which is characteristic of a people as a whole. The fatalism of the Turk, thet logical mind of the French, the sentimentality of the German, are such traits that are mere abstractions derived from general impressions.</p><p>
The essential difficulty in obtaining a clear understanding of the problem is that we do not know how primitive cultures came to be what they are. The standardized picture appears as a stable fabric. We do not know whence it came nor whither, if left alone, it would drift.</p><p>
In the development of scientific inquiry a number of questions develop; first of all, the problem whether a cause can be found for the particular static behavior that has been observed. The answer may be sought in various directions: it may be asked whether it it determined by the physical character of the people or by geographical and social environment; or whether it is due to historical causes. Speculative answers have been attempted along all these lines. On pages 117-121 we have discussed and criticized the theory that ascribes the character and customs of a people to their bodily build. We repeat that the proof of an important influence of racial descent has not been given. Individually the hereditary determination of behavior under given conditions is presumably important; but since each race includes a large number of biologically distinct strains which in regard to their functional activities overlap, race alone cannot have an essential influence upon cultural behavior. The distinction between the behavior of pure-bred strains of domesticated animals that do show decidedly distinct racial personalities and the human races which include many varieties of personalities must again be emphasized.</p><p>
Not even the most opinionated biologist would dare to claim that the cultural pattern of a group of people of the same descent has always remained the same. The pure-blood pygmy living in the woods and his congeners forming regiments under orders of the Mangbattu are hardly culturally identical; nor are the Turks who swept over Europe the same as the Kemalites of our day. The Indian of the Plains in the days when distinction was obtained by warlike deeds and his poverty-stricken descendant of our days are culturally worlds apart. The Zulu of Chaka's time and the one who is assiduously studying arts and sciences are of the same blood, but their</p><p>
It cannot be shown by the widest stretch of the imagination thai descent makes it impossible to partake of any given type of culture provided the individual is completely socially one of the people among whom he lives and, what is more important, is considered also by society as one of its members.</p><p>
The biological approach is not promising when w r e wish to understand the history of cultures. We have also shown the limitations oi the attempts to explain culture as due to environmental and economic factors. These have their influence upon existing cultures, limiting certain activities and facilitating others, but they do not create culture. In an analysis of culture these influences have to be considered, but they do not explain the foundations of the fabric.</p><p>
The* indispensable means for clearing up the history of culture are data that exhibit, not the static picture of our time, but the actual changes of earlier times. Unfortunately these data are not amenable to observation. Under unusually favorable conditions archaeological data give us information on the gradual changes of material culture and allow also inferences regarding a few aspects of the inner life of the people. Arid countries like Egypt, large parts of Asia, southwestern United States, parts of Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia are of this character. Every one of these countries has yielded data that allow us to sec changing cultures, local types developing here and there, inner developments and foreign elements giving rise to new forms. The prehistory of Europe, notwithstanding all its doubtful problems, presents the same picture.</p><p>
By far the larger part of the world does not permit the application of this method, either on account of lack of prehistoric material, or because of breaks in the record due to a sudden displacement of one people by another. Under these circumstances there is no truly historical material available, and whatever results can be obtained; must be based on conditions as they existed at the time when each culture was studied. Historical data can only be inferred from these.</p><p>
I The tradition of primitive people is an unsafe guide for the reconstruction of cultural history. Generally the knowledge of the past treasured by primitive peopte is underestimated.tln many cases the* names of seven or more generations of ancestors are remembered, but the details regarding their lives are scanty and often tell no more than their marriages and warlike deeds, which from the point of view of cultural history give little light. In North America one</p><p>
may hear of the time when horses were first introduced among a certain tribe. The Eskimo of Frobisher Bay recall many details of the visit of Frobisher in 1577. More often remote tradition becomes fantastic and intermingled with mythical tales. Tales of migrations are particularly liable to be purely mythological. Therefore traditions of early times that contain elements apparently important from an historical point of view can be utilized only if there is ample corroborative evidence. The very fact that cultures are interdependent permits us to reconstruct historical happenings with a fair degree of certainty. It is Ratzel's great merit to have emphasized this possibility. In some cases concrete results may be obtained.) As an example we may recall the distribution of maize in America. When it became known that Mexico was the home of the wild plant from which Indian corn in descended, it followed that the cultivation must have spread from there north and south. Similarly with all other features the home of which can be determined. If by good fortune archaeological evidence gives us a clue as to the time when they first appeared in parts of the area, it may even be possible to reconstruct some sort of approximate chronology. Similar conditions prevail when the importation of foreign materials indicates the direction of trade, particularly when the handling of the material imitates the methods in use in the place of its origin.</p><p>
The observation that many cultural features are spread over limited geographical areas and do not occur outside of these gives us a means of studying cultural relations. The Sun Bance, for example, is confined to the Mississippi basin and part of the immediate neighborhood. It has many distinctive local features, but the complex as a whole, with many details, is common to the whole area. It is therefore safe to assume that it originated here and was adopted by many tribes that differ in many other respects.</p><p>
Here, however, the Question arises whether we can determine the place of origin. Many ethnologists hold to the opinion that wherever a certain cultural feature shows its strongest development, decreasing in complexity and importance as distance from its center increases, there must be its origin.</p><p>
It does not require much thought to recognize that, while this may be the case, it is not by any means a necessary conclusion to be derived from the facts. It would be just as possible to assume a wide distribution of the basic feature which gained its highest development locally. It might even be that a foreign importation took root and developed vigorously in a new soil. The argument is as little conclusive as if we were to assume that a plant, like the Ginko, that is confined nowadays to one locality must have originated there, "while paleontology proves that its distribution in earlier times*was very wide.</p><p>
In other words, while we can prove in many cases the fact of dis semination, it is often impossible to determine its direction. In some' instances there is a strong plausibility for the direction in which cultural traits may have traveled, particularly when stray lines of diffusion emanate from a center or when a few stray elements are interspersed in a foreign culture. An example of such an occurrence is the American story of the deluge, which is ended by animals diving for earth. This occurs in a solid area in the region of the Great Lakes and farther west. On the Pacific coast it is found in a few isolated spots along trade routes, in British Columbia and California, but in very fragmentary and highly modified forms. It does not seem likely that we should search for its origin on the Pacific coast. If it were of wide distribution in that region the question would be open to doubt. An example of the stray occurrence of foreign elements is that of a few Indian stories among the Eskimo, few in number and rather distinctive in character. Another case is that of agriculture in North Australia, a cultural feature foreign to the rest of the continent. On the whole the direction of diffusion and the location of origin cannot often be ascertained, while his-Â» torical relations can be demonstrated.</p><p>
4 Distributional areas are most impressive in the domain of mate-. rial culture, because under similar methods of obtaining sustenance,' which are controlled by geographic conditions, whole complexes of objects and activities are common to fairly large areas. I On this basis the concept of "culture areas" has developed â€” first of all as a convenience in museum administration, because it made it possible to group material from many different tribal units in one comprehensive scheme.</p><p>
Unfortunately the primary object of this grouping was soon forgotten and the culture areas were assumed to be natural group^ that divided mankind into so many cultural groups. Actually the student interested in religion, social organization, or some other aspect of culture would soon discover that the culture areas based on material culture do not coincide with those that would naturally result from his studies. This is most easily seen in the complete disagreement between linguistic groups and culture areas. Attempts to map the. distribution of definite cultural traits that occur over continuous areas prove that various forms overlap irregularly. Culture areas have a meaning only from the particular point of view from which they have been obtained. To give only one example. The form of material culture of the tribes of northern Vancouver * Island is so similar to that of the northern coast of British Columbia that it would be difficult to differentiate between the two. On the other hand the social organization and the concept of the origin of families are totally different.</p><p>
The establishment of culture areas as units of general validity has also led to the concept of marginal cultures which are liable to be considered as inferior to the centers in which the traits of the culture area are most fully developed. Here also serious misunderstandings arise if we generalize this concept. It may well be that a culture is not so thoroughly institutionalized as another neighboring one and that, at the same time, the material possessions may be less complex. It does not follow that the cultural life of the people is poorer, because it is not so easy for the observer to formalize a culture permitting greater freedom to the individual. The concept ofi culture area should therefore always be used with a clear under1 standing of its limitations.</p><p>
We have spoken so far of the possibility of analyzing a culture in regard to the provenience of the elements composing the whole. There are other indications that permit us now and then to infer that new developments have occurred. This is the case particularly when a cultural trait appears in a strong contrast to the needs of everyday life. An example is the tent of the Reindeer Chukchee, an exceedingly clumsy affair, difficult to transport on account of the weight of the cover and the many tent poles required for its erection. Its plan may be derived from the semi-subterranean house of the</p><p>
Maritime Chukchee, which has low walls and a flat roof. The arrangement of the low walls is imitated by a series of low tripods placed in a circle over which the roof is erected. The contrast between this tent and the light tent of the Eskimo, which may be transported on a single sledge, is striking. A similar case is probably the semi-subterranean house of Northwest America, which extends through part of California and has its analogue in the ceremonial kiva of the Pueblos, in w r hose home climatic conditions do not require the protection offered by this structure in more inhospitable climates.</p><p>
The whole group of " survivals " which has been so thoroughly exploited by Tylor belongs to this group. There is no doubt that a thorough analysis of cultures will indicate the persistence of earlier stages. I am inclined to believe that the custom of the Northwest Coast Indians of having certain initiates come in through the roof, and their tales of supernatural beings who approach through the roof, indicate that in early times subterranean lodges with entrance through the roof were used or at least known to the people.</p><p>
In these attempts we arc naturally led to the problem as to whether it can be decided which are the oldest traits of a culture. If it were possible to point out chronologically those traits that are late introductions, this problem would be solved, but it seems more than doubtful whether a generally valid method can be discovered except in the cases of the occurrence of discordant survivals. Examples are:,the custom of using stone implements in rituals long after the use of bronze or iron had been invented; the production of fire by drilling when more effective methods were known; and the many cases of conservative resistance in our own culture to, changes the usefulness of which is readily recognized â€” for example, resistance to changes in the forms of our alphabet, the keyboard of the piano, our calendar, our system of measures.</p><p>
If it were possible to determine certain groups of ethnic phenomena that are exceptionally constant and that are always stable our problem might be solved. Physical type, language, social organization, invention, religious ideas, may all be stable or unstable, according to local and historical conditions. As long as, on account of their diverse degrees of stability or instability, no grave inner conflicts develop, the most heterogeneous congeries of cultural traits may exist, in which it is impossible to determine what is old and what is new. Some kind of formalization always develops that makes apparently contradictory ideas compatible.</p><p>
The study of the distribution of cultural traits which we have so far discussed will give us a limited amount of information in regard to historical facts, illustrating the former relations between tribes.</p><p>
The problem of the development of culture is not by any means exhausted by even the fullest information that may be obtained by the study of archaeology and of distribution. Notwithstanding incongruities that are never entirely absent, each culture is a whole, and its form has a dynamic force which determines the behavior of the mass of individuals. It is only from their thoughts and acts, from the products of their actions, that we derive the concept of their culture. How far an individual is able to free himself from the fetters that culture lays upon him depends not only upon his individuality but equally, if not more, upon the culture imposed upon him. History gives us no direct clue to an understanding of the expression of culture in individual life.</p><p>
To give an example. For the illiterate speaker the history of his language is irrelevant. What is important for an understanding of the function of language in cultural life is the question how the Procrustean bed of language shapes ideas; how the emotional tone of words and phrases influences action; and how the activities of man modify language. The same is no less true in other fields. The cultural conditions of a people have had a long history. We want to know that history; but even an intimate knowledge of the past docs not explain the reactions of an individual living at a given moment to the cultural and individual stresses that determine his actions. While historical data may permit us every now and then to infer from observed changes the forces that are released by the interplay of all the different elements of culture acting upon each person according to his individuality and resulting in stability or change, we can never obtain a clear insight into these except by the study of a multitude of individuals reacting to a culture, and by study of the cumulative effect of these reactions.</p><p>
A detailed study of the behavior of many individuals at a given moment may disclose tendencies of change, because some of them will lag behind and represent an earlier stage of culture while others forge ahead of their time. In some cases it will be possible to evaluate the relative strength of lag and of forward push that permits a fairly safe prognosis of the direction in which cultural phenomena may be moving. An excellent example of such analysis has been given by Alexander the Pawnee in which, through a study of the changes that occurred during the past sixty or seventy years, adjustments of new tendencies and old customs have been traced. In a similar way adjustments may be observed in the household arrangements of the Kwakiutl Indians. In olden times the people used to sit at meal time leaning against a backboard, their knees drawn up, the food being spread on a mat. In feasts they continue this habit, but when eating in the family circle they use nowadays a low table, about fifteen centimeters high, and a very low stool. It may be predicted that the height of table and stool will increase. The modern houses are also an adjustment of the American frame house to their social requirements. The front room is large and unfurnished, with a stove in the center, corresponding to the old square house with a fire in the middle; the living quarters, which in olden times consisted of small sheds surrounding the central room, have now been relegated to the rear of the house. In our own culture the increasing tendency to socialization, to the better adjustment between the needs of the individual and those of society as a whole, presents a similar spectacle.</p><p>
We may perhaps compare the problem of the predictability of cul-! tural changes with that of the predictability of the movements of a number of bodies distributed in space, the velocity of each being known. On the basis of our knowledge of the laws of gravitation the future movements and positions of these bodies may be predicted. In the case of social phenomena the "laws" are not so well known, and on account of the multiplicity of contradictory elements prediction is not certain. Nevertheless the general dynamic tendencies of cultural change may be understood by such an analysis.</p><p>
The historical study needs as its supplement knowledge of the dynamic processes that may be observed in living cultures. These ir their turn will throw light upon historical happenings, for conditions of the past may be better understood by knowledge of the processes that may be observed at the present time. Based on these considerations, the hope has arisen anew that laws of general validity may be found that control all historical happenings, that allow us to state not only the dynamic conditions controlling the interplay between the different manifestations of cultural life, but also the necessary sequences of cultural forms.</p><p>
A number of social tendencies that are apparently generally valid may be isolated. Their psychological basis and the forms in which they find expression may be studied. Thus the solidarity of social groups and their antagonism toward the outsider; the forms anc motives for coordination and subordination; imitation of, and resistance to, outside influences; competition between individuals anc between groups; division of labor; amalgamation and segregation attitudes toward the supernatural â€” to mention only a few â€” ma> be investigated. These expressions of social life are generally valid The same is true of individual mental states and processes. Feai and hope, love and hate, the valuation of good and bad, of beautiful and ugly, are general human characteristics that find expressior in social conduct. From these studies a cultural morphology may be constructed and a social psychology developed, based on the variety of manifestations of these categories. *</p><p>
A cultural morphology is necessarily founded on comparative studies of similar forms in different parts of the world. If its data are to be significant for the development of social laws, similarities due to cultural dissemination must be eliminated. Thus the similarities between administrative organization and judicial procedure found in Africa cannot be considered as expressions of a law of development of human culture, because they must be considered as part of the general cultural development of Europe, and of a large part of Asia. This is proved by the contrast between Old World and aboriginal American institutions. The development of African iron industry and cattle-breeding is also historically related to those of other parts of the Old World. If these are excluded, there remain morphological similarities that require study.</p><p>
To this group belong similarities in the forms of relationship systems based on distinct principles of classification, many of which are so irregularly distributed that historical unity of origin is practically excluded. Their similarities may be compared to those expressed in language in which similar principles of classification of concepts are found in disconnected areas; such as masculine and feminine, animate and inanimate.</p><p>
The morphological classification leads to two problems: the one, how far the various types represent a progressive series; the other, whether they can be reduced to general socio-psychological laws.</p><p>
The system of forms established on the basis of morphological likeness and unlikeness has no historical value unless it can be proved that the forms actually follow one another in historical sequence. Errors, based on the assumption that these classes repre sent a historical sequence, are found mainly in the writings of the evolutionary school. They appear in a variety of forms. Thus the classification of certain art forms beginning with naturalistic representation and leading to conventionalized forms is valid; but this does not prove that this classification coincides with an historical sequence, unless actual historical proof can be given. In its absence validity can be claimed only for the constant interplay between realism and conventionalism.</p><p>
Art is also quite often associated with religious ideas; but this does not prove that the origin of art must be looked for in religious motives. A classification of the forms of art from this viewpoint has no necessary relation to their historical development. In some cases the relfgious significance of the work of art will stimulate the development of a higher style; in other cases it will induce slovenly execution, perhaps due to the short-lived usefulness of the object.</p><p>
To this group also belongs the much discussed problem of the development of family organization, whether maternal institutions must precede paternal succession. The various chapters of the present volume show that the proof of a uniform historical sequence cannot be given.</p><p>
The question of development in a definite direction is closely connected with our concept of progress. The very concept of progress presupposes a standard toward which culture advances, and a decision cannot be avoided as to what this standard is to be. It seems almost unavoidable that this standard will be based on our own experience, on our own civilization. It is clear that this is an arbitrary standard and it is perhaps the greatest value of anthropology that it makes us acquainted with a great variety of such standards. Before the question can be decided as to what progress is, we must know whether general human values exist by which we may measure progress.</p><p>
In one respect we may well speak of progress. Since earliest times knowledge and control of nature have received constant additions without any serious losses. New powers have been acquired and new insight has been opened. The ability of man to cope with his environment has improved, and new resources have been made available. At the same time the progress of knowledge has led to the elimination of error. The conflict between rational thought, on the one hand, and emotional reactions and rigid tradition, on the other, has tended to lead to the supremacy of reason, although the</p><p>
emotional elements have continued and still continue to shape the form of culture.</p><p>
The step from knowledge acquired for the most part accidentally, through daily experience, to systematic inquiry has not often been made. The astrologers of Babylonia and Mexico, the mathematicians of India and Yucatan, the Chinese, and the Greeks succeeded in taking this step. Even when this advance was made, imagination and tradition were not at once eliminated, but entered into the structure of early science.</p><p>
If we should value progress entirely by the development of invention and knowledge, it would be easy to arrange the divisions of mankind in order of progress, beginning with the simplest cultures of early Paleolithic man and leading up to modern civilizations in Europe and its colonies and in many parts of Asia.</p><p>
It is not so easy to define progress in other aspects of culture, except in so far as increasing knowledge weakens the hold of older concepts. This may be illustrated by the advance in ethical behavior. Westermarck, Hobhouse, and Sutherland have given us full data on the evolution of ethical behavior, but it is not by any moans clear that this is identical with an advance in ethical ideas. Ethical behavior may well be understood as reflecting the same moral ideas in different types of society and modified by existing institutions and by the extent of knowledge. The languages of people all over the world prove that the vices that we know, such as murder, theft, lying, rape, are recognized and in most cases discountenanced within the social group in which mutual duties are recognized. The difference consists largely in the increasing recognition of rights of those outside of one's own group, and these are based on an appreciation of similarities that were previously not recognized. While in early times the outsider was an enemy just as much as a wild beast, his human rights were slowly understood, a process that is not yet completed, since to us the rights of the alien are still considered on a level different from the rights of the citizen. 9</p><p>
It is perhaps still more difficult to define progress in social organization since in this field our own ideals are not uniform. "The extreme individualist might consider anarchy as his ideal. Others may believe in extreme voluntary regimentation; still others in a powerful control of the individual by society or in subjection to intelligent â€” or emotional and unintelligent â€” leadership. Developments in all these directions have occurred and may still be observed in</p><p>
the history of modern States. We may speak of progress in certain directions, hardly of absolute progress, except in so far as it is dependent upon knowledge which contributes to the safety of human life, health, and comfort." 10</p><p>
The widening of the concept of humanity has had a very slow influence upon the breaking up of the concept of the status of an individual. The French Revolution tried to abolish it and the young American Republic rejected it, although it continued to maintain the status of slavery. In modern western civilization the extent to which the status of a person is determined by birth or by social segregation has been losing in force. In the United States the racial status of the Negro and East Asiatic still prevails, and Germany has relapsed into the crudity of determining the status of an individual by his racial descent. In primitive societies of complex structure the status of a person as member of a clan, an age group, a ranking group, is often absolutely determined. In the group of relatives it depends upon his position in the family, as parent, uncle or aunt, parent-in-law, and so on. In most societies the status determined by sex is rigid because it depends upon the unescapable economic duties of man and woman and upon the limitations put upon woman by her sexual life. With the change of these conditions in modern life the status of woman has lost most of its fixity, and it may be predicted that its artificial reestablishment which is being attempted in Germany will prove futile.</p><p>
These considerations show that a historical interpretation of classifications of social forms as expressing progress can be achieved to a very limited extent only.</p><p>
Another problem of the morphology of culture refers to the interrelation between various manifestations of cultural life.</p><p>
There is an obvious interrelation between economic conditions and other aspects of life. Hunting tribes compelled to wander about, following the game, and having no domesticated animals to help in the transportation of goods, cannot amass bulky property. Their industrial products will be confined to the necessities of life. Their handiwork may be technically perfect and even show an appreciation of adornment, but the necessity to avoid encumbering the wanderer will act as a hindrance to the development of industries. If the conditions happen to be more propitious, so that food may be accumulated and stored for a longer period, perhaps to such an extent that larger gatherings of members of the tribe and of friendly</p><p>
tribes become possible, new stimuli may arise, connected with the periodic stability of the groups and their stronger social contacts. On the other hand, a stable population with a plentiful food supply that does not necessitate constant exertion on the part of every member of the tribe to procure the necessary food supply will give opportunity for more varied industrial activities and the accumulation of property. A dense population, which can arise only when the food supply is ample, leads, if the group forms a political unit, to division of labor and necessitates a more rigid social organization. When the political units remain small, the influence of the density of population may be very slight.</p><p>
It is advantageous to investigate those types of social conduct that are mutually contradictory and therefore cannot exist side by side. Sparsity of population and complex political organization; isolation of small groups of individuals that are economically self-sustaining and elaborate division of labor; inability to preserve food supply and capitalism; nomadic life and high development of architecture; elaborate music and absence of wind, string, or other tuned instruments; formal law without any kind of legal sanctions, are such contradictions. Others not so evident may be discovered. In their study it will be found that sometimes the most devious ways are used to make it possible for contradictory types of behavior to exist side by side. Thus the Toda insist on strict endogamy in formal marriage, but permit exogamic relations. Some North American tribes insist on valor as a proof of manhood, but honor at the same time a person who refuses to go to war.</p><p>
The existence of certain fundamental relations between social phenomena of distinct types may be illustrated by many examples. In an attempt to apply them to specific cultures many important variations are found, so that the fundamental points are often obscured. The poor hunters and food-gatherers of Tierra del Fuego are, so far as their food supply is concerned, no worse off than the fishing and hunting people of both coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Though they lack abundance of vegetable products and of wood easily worked, this alone does not sufficiently explain the difference, both in quality and quantity, of their industrial products. In their case other causes have interfered with the clear expression of the relation between food supply, possibility of stable location, and cultural development.</p><p>
The attempts to correlate forms of relationship systems with different cultural levels have also failed. It is quite true that in a small, inbreeding population the system of social relationship may include all the members of the community, while in widely scattered groups the social bond uniting members of common descent or those bound by ties of affinity may be highly modified. Nevertheless there is nq evidence that density of population, stability of location, or economic status is necessarily connected with a particular system of relationship and of behavior connected with it. The scattered community may preserve part of its unity in a sib organization, or it may break apart in small families held together by cultural interests of a different order.</p><p>
The dynamic conditions controlling the permanence of large groups* of relatives and their breaking up may be described. Their manifestation in any particular society cannot be determined on the basis of these dynamic laws alone, but is dependent upon each particular social constellation.</p><p>
The lack of specific coherence between various aspects of culture has been effectively illustrated by Andrew Lang in his introduction to K. Langloh Parker's book, The Enahlayi Tribe, where he shows that social organization and types of religious ideas cannot be considered as mutual determinants.</p><p>
The very existence of society must depend upon the preponderance of unity over disruptive forces. Native cultures are subject to such disruptive forces during periods of transition to modern standards. Thus the Pueblos of the North American Southwest have split into separate groups of conservatives and progressives with the result that the progressives in some cases have established villages of their own. The struggle between the uniting and disrupting forces does not mean that every culture strives for a maximum of harmony. On the contrary, there are many in which the individual cannot lead a happy life without conflicts within the tribe. Societies torn by vendetta or by fear of witchcraft are examples of this condition. The extend *o which disrupting forces are tolerated depends entirely upon the type of culture and the emotional strength of the contradictory tendencies.</p><p>
It seems most desirable and worth while to understand each culture as a whole and to define its character. In our modern civilization the social groups are so highly differentiated that it would be difficult to indicate more than general tendencies resulting from many conflicting or even contradictory attitudes. The political fanatic, the scientist, the unskilled laborer, the industrial magnate, cannot be welded into</p><p>
the picture of one personality, although all of them are part and parcel of our civilization. The impression prevails that in simple cultures in which there is no cultural differentiation the individual is much more strictly a representative of the whole culture, and that in these cases it is possible to give a picture of the culture which is at the same time a picture of a personality. It is not quite easy to determine the value of such a picture. Is it that of a "typical" representative personality? In how far is such a picture schematic? Can the investigator grasp this picture without coloring it by his own subjective attitudes?</p><p>
The difficulties of this problem are obvious and are analogous to those confronting us in the attempt to understand a personality as a whole. Many psychologists try in vain to determine the traits of a personality by means of experimental observations of its attitude in a number of simple, controlled situations. The answers they receive cannot give any information containing more than the observed reactions to these situations. The personality as a whole is not the sum of these single reactions, which are determined in part organically, in part culturally. The multiplicity of experiences brings about variable reactions determined by conflicts of wishes and desires, and only by grasping the whole of these can we gain a picture of the personality. In interpreting these results many psychologists are concerned in the question how far the varying reactions are organically determined. The personality of the observer and its influence upon his interpretations play an important role in the result of these studies. Otherwise we should not have so many contradictory interpretations of historic figures. When the psychologist or psychiatrist attempts to enter more deeply into the manifestations of mental life, he may perhaps give us new data for an understanding of personalities. Nevertheless the contradictions between the interpretations that are given to us prove that the picture is deeply influenced by the mind of the observer. When the attempt is made to establish types on this basis additional difficulties of interpretation are added.</p><p>
New obstacles arise when we try to apply these methods to the study of types of culture. No matter how strongly a community may be controlled by dominating thoughts, they do not influence the behavior of the same individual at all times in the same ways, and different individuals also react to them each in his own way. A tolerably clear picture results only when the dominating form has such vigor that individualities are suppressed by it. The range of variations</p><p>
in the behavior of members of the tribe, the frequency or rarity of conflicts with the common behavior, determine the strength of custom in the life of the people. The mightier their influence, the more difficult it is for the individual to withstand it. Marriage regulations may serve as an example. When endogamous marriages are strictly forbidden, there exists apparently, on the whole, sexual indifference between members of the opposite sexes who are riot permitted to marry. Nevertheless passionate love between man and woman of tabooed relationship does occur, strong enough to run counter to custom. How far real sexual indifference exists can be determined only by means of a most detailed and thorough knowledge of the individuals. Observations of the customary behavior may be quite misleading. Our own experience of the sexual relations between brothers and sisters allows us to conclude that, owing to the presence of custom, sexual indifference is the rule. This inference is strengthened by the observation that in cultures that are disintegrating under the influence of European contact, restrictions of permitted marriage rules are liable to resist for a long time. It is more difficult to understand sexual indifference in those cases in which the choice of mates is restricted to few individuals, as it is in Australia, or in group exclusions in which the marriage of a man with a woman of another group prevents all reciprocal marriages of a man of the second group with a woman of the first group, as among the Gilyak. 12</p><p>
The customs regulating the hunt on which depends the well-being of the whole community are another example. Such dependence is found among the Eskimo. The individual is hardly in a position to free himself from their compelling force, for the danger of starvation is ever present; for this reason every member of the tribe is subject to the supervision of his acts by his tribe fellows.</p><p>
In some cases the orientation of the tribe in relation to certain aspects of its culture finds expression even in its language. Thus the Dakota distinguish rigidly between the possession of objects that are the exclusive property of one person and can never belong to anyone else, such as the parts of his body; possessions that may be transferred to others; and another group that can never be the property of a single person, such as food, including meals prepared by a single individual, and objects of nature â€” in short, anything that the tribe needs for its sustenance. The categories of different types of possession are clearly and definitely expressed by linguistic forms. ( These examples prove 'that behavior in relation to certain aspects of life may be governed by fundamental concepts and that these are amenable to objective observation.)</p><p>
In most cases their influence does not extend over the whole range of social forms, but is restricted in its scope. For the characterization of a culture we need a knowledge of those fundamental concepts that find expression in the widest range of social forms and activities.</p><p>
Most attempts to characterize the social life of peoples are hampered by the lack of uniform behavior of all individuals, by the diversity of social activities, and by the subjective interest of the student, which is challenged by the contrast between the observed behavior and his own accustomed attitudes. The Eskimo are often described as good-natured, of sunny temperament. This seems to form a striking contrast to the difficulties of life in an Arctic cljmate. It is true that they are indifferent to the hardships of daily life and possess a tenacity of purpose that makes them feel as slight discomfort what might appear to us as unsupportable hardship, and the poor comforts of their homes give to them rest and social pleasures which they enjoy thoroughly. By contrast we observe among them subservience to the brutality of "strong men." The maltreated community endures their dominion until finally it rises and kills the tyrant. We note cases of treacherous murder among friends of long standing, fear of sickness, and a belief in the inclination of some to live the life of hermits. There is no fundamental trait from which the varied manifestations of social life can be viewed. Perhaps it might be said that in a community lacking stratification and characterized by general mutual friendliness a man of unusual physical and mental qualities and filled with an abnormal desire for power may become a tyrant; more so than in a tribe in which the privileges of every individual are subject to fixed norms and in which each has recognized rights and duties â€” provided these are not centered in one individual or in a small group. Perhaps even the tendency to isolation of individuals might be considered as due to the general conditions of life that force everyone to the utmost degree of self-reliance. Making allowance for all this, a clear-cut picture does not result. The love of the men for a playful practice of the art of carving which leads to the manufacture of well-executed figures of animals â€” a feature that is even more pronounced among the Chukchee and Koryak; the care which the women use in developing beautiful designs of clothing by means of contrasting effects of color of fur; the striking poverty of stories relating to animals as contrasted with folk tales dealing with</p><p>
human life, cannot be considered as closely correlated with other traits of their life. Notwithstanding the importance of economic conditions, there does not seem any reason why these features of social life should be designated as superstructure, for it cannot be shown that they are determined by economic conditions, although they bear a relation to them, as to all other phases of culture.</p><p>
Much clearer and of unified character is the picture in those cultures in which a dominant idea rather than the predominant occupation controls life. This seems to be the case, for instance, among the Indians of the Plains. Not only was war a principal occupation, but the worth of a man depended to such an extent upon the glory of warlike deeds that the whole life seemed to be filled by the desire for what jvere considered heroic deeds. The imagination of the Eskimo dwells on the dangers and successes of the hunt of sea animals. The leading motive in the life of the Plains Indian was the desire for fame as a warrior. The difference in the situation among these two groups may perhaps be seen in a difference of affective emphasis. The Indian finds relief in an affective situation by going on the warpath cither alone or with some friends. Mourning, shame, annoyance, are conquered by warlike deeds. Conventional ornament is interpreted as referring to war. Thus a design of two triangles with apices touching is viewed as two groups of warriors meeting in combat. To the observer this attitude seems the most prominent trait of their culture, a feature entirely foreign to the Eskimo.</p><p>
Another trait is their love of elaborate ceremonialism, which is present on all occasions and plays an important role in their conduct of war. Every important affair calls for complicated and ostentatious ceremonies.</p><p>
Nevertheless, this does not give an exhaustive picture, for the domestic life of these people opens other vistas. Within the tribe liberality, integrity, chastity, and mercifulness are subjects of praise. Neither is it permissible to generalize from the valor of the warrior and to assume that the Indian is free of fear. Not only the supernatural fills him with awe and frightens him; disease also breaks his courage and finds him full of fear of sorcery and of death.</p><p>
Evidently, the wider the scope of a leading motive of culture the more it will appear as characteristic of the whole culture, but we must not be deceived into believing that it will give us an exhaustive picture of all the sides of culture.</p><p>
As an example I may refer again to the Indians of the Northwest Coast of America. The leading motive of their lives is the limitless pursuit of gaining social prestige and of holding on to what has been gained, and the intense feeling of inferiority and shame if even the slightest part of prestige has been lost. This is manifest not only in the attempts to attain a coveted high position, but equally in the endeavor to be considered the most atrocious member of the tribe. Rank and wealth are valued most highly, but there are also cases of criminals (in the sense of the culture we are discussing) who vie with each other in committing atrocities. A loss of prestige in either sense is a source of shame which must be made good by some action reestablishing the lost respect. If this is not possible it leads to suicide. Art consists in the glorification of the family crest or of family histories. A pretense of excessive conservatism, often contradicted by obvious changes of behavior, is closely allied with the jealous watch over all privileges.</p><p>
These tendencies are so striking that the amiable qualities that appear in intimate family life are easily overlooked. These are not by any means absent. In contrast to the jealousy with which prerogatives are guarded, everyone within the family circle belittles his position. Husband and wife address each other as "You whose slave I am/' or "You whose dog I am." Parents and grandparents designate themselves in the same way when talking to their children, who in turn use nicknames when addressing their parents and grandparents.</p><p>
The less pronounced the leading ideas of a simple culture, or the more varying the ideas of a tribe divided into social strata, the more difficult it is to draw a valid picture that does not contain contradictions. We cannot hope to do more than to elucidate the leading ideas, remembering clearly the limitations of their validity.</p><p>
The socio-psychological study, more than any other aspect of anthropological investigation, requires that freedom from cultural prejudice which in itself can be attained only by the intensive study of foreign cultures of fundamentally distinctive types that make clear to us which among our own concepts are determined by our modern culture and which may be generally valid, because based on human nature.
