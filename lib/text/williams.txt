Chapter V </p><p>
THE "LOST TRIBES" OF ISRAEL </p><p> If we are to establish historical contact between the Hebrews and the parent-stock of the Ashanti, it now becomes necessary to check up every possible channel by which diffusion between the two groups was possible. At the very outset, two main lines of inquiry present themselves on account of the duality of the divided Kingdom of Israel. And yet, strictly speaking it is only with the Judeans that we have to deal, since the destruction of the Northern Tribes was definitive and complete. However, as Professor Dixon says: "A few generations ago cultural parallels between the customs and beliefs of aboriginal peoples and those of the Hebrews as recorded in the Bible, were explained in accordance with the theories of the times, as the degenerate survivals of ancient Semitic culture, diffused by the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Traces of these extremely elusive wanderers were found in every quarter of the globe, and Bushman and Eskimo, Australian and American Indian were alike credited with being their descendants."  And although Professor Dixon adds : "The ghost of the Lost Tribes has long since been laid, except perhaps for some whose judgment is ruled by their imagination," a it may be well to introduce here a short chapter on the subject, to clarify our own position and to definitively eliminate all question of any contact between the Ashanti and the Northern Kingdom of Israel, </p><p> Professor Rawlinson of Oxford, in assailing the RawSison. position of those who would derive the AngloSaxon Race from the "Lost Tribes" of Israel, ridicules the attempt, and declares that these much lost Tribes "have been found a hundred times by a hundred different travellers, and in a hundred different localities," and goes on to endorse the statement of Kitto: "There is scarcely any human race so abject, forlorn, and dwindling, located anywhere, between the Chinese and American Indians, who have not been stated to be the Ten Tribes."  </p><p> Anglo-Saxons Towards the middle of the last century, "Our </p><p> Israelitish Origin" by John Wilson  revived an old controversy, in an effort to derive the Anglo-Saxon Race from </p><p> Afghan women and many of the men are 'of a distinctly Jewish cast of countenance/ and that a large number of them have Jewish- Christian names, such as Ibrahim for Abraham, Ayub for Job, Ismail for Ishmael, Ishak for Isaac, Yohia for John, Yakub for Jacob, Daoud for David and Suleiman for Solomon. The Afghans, moreover, are known to recognize a common code of unwritten law which appears to resemble the old Hebraic law, though it has been modified by Mohammedan ordinances. A further strengthening of the theory has been found in the story that *when Nebuchadnezzar overcame the Children of Israel certain of the Jewish tribes, and perhaps all of 'the lost ten tribes/ made their way eastward into a mountainous country and settled eventually in the country of Afghara, where they founded the race, of the Afghans.' And would-be supporters of the theory — like Lord Curzon himself — are especially impressed by the fact that for centuries past, and to this day, the majority of Afghans have stoutly defended the belief in their Hebrew descent. Why, it is asked, should their historians have called them Beni- Israel, meaning in the Arabic tongue 'The People of Israel'? When it comes to chapter and verse there are serious doubts in the way. Sir Edward Denison Ross, a famous expert in oriental history and languages, comes near calling the whole theory 'a myth/ 'If the Afghans were in origin a Semitic people,* he says, 'we should expect to find some trace of that origin in their language, whereas as a matter of fact there is none. As for Jewish names, they are simply taken from the Koran, and we find them among all the Mohammedan peoples/ And as to the 'Jewish cast of countenance' noticed in the Afghans another expert reminds us that 'while as a rule the Afghan nose is long and curved, this Jewish, or, rather, Hittite, nose is very widespread, and is a characteristic of races in no way connected with the Children of Israel/ It would thus seem that the theory now under discussion must be classed as one of a number which have been devised to explain the origin of the Afghans, for they have been traced to Copts, Armenians, Albanians, Turks, Arabs and Rajputs, And eager as are the subjects of the King of Afghanistan to claim Hebrew descent there is little likelihood of them joining the Zionist movement or swelling the 20th century migration to the Holy Land" the Ten Tribes of Israel, that have come to be known in history as "The Lost Tribes." The Reverend E. Beckersteth proceeded to refute the arguments advanced by the theory. During the next quarter of a century there were spasmodic attempts to popularize the idea, but it was not until early in 187 1 that the interest of the general public was aroused. "Twenty-seven Identifications of the English Nation with the Lost House of Israel" by Edward Hine, followed by subsequent brochures. "Flashes of Light" and "AngloSaxon Riddles," drew down on the author the wrath of his kinsman, Professor George Rawlinson, of* Oxford, and Canon of Canterbury. That a person of such distinction should take notice of the theory, even to assail it, gave the question the needed publicity, and the controversy was well under way. </p><p> Edward Hine, in his reply to Canon Rawlinson, denies having ever read more than "a few extracts" from the earlier book of Wilson, despite the fact that a striking similarity of treatment had been pointed out.  Others besides the Oxford Professor had ventured to take exceptions to his attempted Hebraization of the Anglo-Saxon Stock. Mr. Hine acknowledges the attentions of some few of them, but brushes them all aside with a single bold stroke of the pen : "Not one objection has foothold as yet, and I believe never can have. The identity of our Nation with Israel is purely God's work, and no man has power to destroy it." c We suspect a little humor on the part of Mr. Hine. </p><p> The discussion now became general, and the literature on the subject is extensive. Space will permit only a few random comments in passing. Thus one writer finds in this theory, facetiously we suspect, the explanation of how despite many miscalculations, </p><p> the ambitions of Britain are usually crowned with Aspects. success. "Why should so small a country as Britain," he asks, "possess such great influence over the world as she does, and be successful in all her wars, notwithstanding that she continually makes the most palpable blunders? We have many faults, socially, nationally, and individually, to confess and bemoan ; yet, for all that, it will be admitted that we are 'a great nation'. What is the secret of Britain's greatness? If it is proved that the British are Israelites, the whole History of England will be understood with a right point of view ; and that is, that God's dealings with her, being Israel, show forth that He is true, faithful, and 'Covenant' keeping : this is the true secret of England's greatness and not any inherent goodness that rests in her or in her people."  </p><p> Meanwhile, as early as 1861, the Reverend F. R. A. David Glover transferring his attention from the Lost Tribes to the surviving Juda, had indicated what he was pleased to call the possible descent of the Royal Family of England from the House of David.  Sixteen years later, a pretentious effort strove to fit in some missing links.  However, the chain was far from complete, and it was left for the ingenuity of the Reverend A. B. Grimaldi, to devise a full unbroken line from David to the then-reigning Queen of England, Victoria of happy memory.  According to his schemata, the Kings of Juda from David to Sedecias, form eighteen links in this chain. The sceptre is then passed down through the Princess Tea Tephi, who, it is asserted, married Heremon, King of Ireland, and their successors, from 578 b. C. to 487 a. D. forming fifty-five links in the chain. Thirteen links of the Royal House of Argylshire passes it on to the Sovereigns of Scotland, a. d. 834, and the chain is finally completed by the twenty-five Scottish links and the successors of James I of England. It is difficult to believe that the expounders of these schemes to Judaize the Royal Family of England really took themselves seriously. And Doctor Wild, at least, must have possessed a rare sense of humor, when he evolved his theory of the Irish Jews.  </p><p> Briefly, his position is as follows. "Two colonies settled in Ireland ; the first, the Phoenicians, who were Philistines or ancient Canaanites. The second settlers were Tuath de Danan. . . . The Phoenicians were sea- faring people; pressed by Israel, Egypt and Assyria, they finally left Canaan, and settled in Ireland."  </p><p> Dr. Wild would have it, that at the time of the Babylonian Captivity, after the Prophet Jeremias was carried into Egypt by the remnant of the people, he escaped thence to Northern Ireland, taking with him the ark of the Covenant, Jacob's pillow — the stone of Israel — as well as the daughter of Sedecias, through whom the royal line was to continue. "Irish histories," he tells us, "some twenty of which we find agree, say that about 585 b. c. a divine man landed in Ulster, having with him the king's daughter, stone of destiny, and ark, and many other wonderful things. The people of Ulster of Dan understood the old adventurer." In passing, the author assures us: "Now at Tara, Jeremiah buried the ark of the covenant, tables of law, etc."  </p><p> As to the presence of the Tribe of Dan in Ulster, the matter is easily explained, according to Doctor Wild's way of thinking. "During the persecution of Ahab, thousands of them left Palestine, settling in Denmark — this word Denmark means the circle of Dan. In course of time they crossed the sea and took possession of the north of Ireland, settling the province of Ulster." Thus we have the dual race of Irishmen — Philistines in the South and God's chosen people in the North. Consequently it is easy for Doctor Wild to explain what must appeal to him as the inferiority complex of the South, which readily fell a prey to the "allurements of Rome."  </p><p> Furthermore, according to Doctor Wild, Jeremias "is the real St. Patrick — simply the Patriarchal Saint, which became St. Patriarch, then St. Patrick. The Roman Church introduced St. Patrick to offset the St. Patriarch."  However, the Doctor admits that the individual commonly revered as the Patron of Ireland was more than a "mythical person." He gives his real name as Calpurnius, and would have him born 387 a. d. near the present city of Boulogne. Further he is satisfied that this Calpurnius was himself a Jew, belonging to the tribe of Benjamin. "For the Benjaminites began to fill in that part of France about this period." </p><p> The author adds : "This tribe were by nature missionaries. This prompted him to desire to redeem his brethren in Ireland. In Ulster he began his labors."  </p><p> Nevertheless, Doctor Wild is insistent that Jeremias "was the real sainted patriarch of Ireland. And by a crafty design of Rome young Calpurnius was created sainted patriarch, or St, Patrick, and by this means Rome linked the greater part of the Irish nation to herself."  And almost it would seem with a sigh of relief, the Doctor takes care to note : "But neither Rome nor any other power ever enslaved or conquered Ulster."  In conclusion it should be observed that in the Doctor's view the division of Ireland is not merely due to religion. It is essentially racial. "The people of Belfast are Danites ; they of Dublin are Phoenicians."  So, after all, the great majority of Irishmen are not Jews, even according to Doctor Wild. </p><p> Whatever we may think of Doctor Wild's sinWanderings cerity in the matter, three years later, not to mention others, the Reverend Doctor Poole seriously undertook a study of the whole question. The Jews as we know them to-day, he regards as the descendants of the Kingdom of Juda. The Lost Tribes, he would trace as follows : "Nineveh was destroyed by the Medes and the Babylonians about 621 b. c. and the Assyrian monarchy divided between them; Israel, or a large portion of them, taking advantage of the opportunity thus afforded, asserted their independence, or escaped, and planted themselves in Armenia, to the north of Assyria. During the several irruptions caused by the conquests of Alexander the Great, and his immediate successors,  they resumed their nomad state, and wandered northward, and westward, to some of the quiet valleys which led them on their way westward and homeward,"  to the British Isles as their journey's end. </p><p> These nomads, Doctor Poole would then identify with the Saxons, and he continues : "Sharon Turner states that, 'Although the Saxon name became on the continent the appellation of a confederacy of nations, yet, at first it denoted a single state, and, it appears, they were so isolated that the Romans did not come into contact with them, though continually devastating by fire and sword, the people intervening between them and the Saxons.' How clearly the providence of God was seen in their history as they passed through the great wilderness of people."  </p><p> In consequence of all this, and similar studies, many wild schemes were evolved, and detailed maps were constructed, marking out the wanderings from the land of exile of these Tribes, which despite their name, absolutely refuse to stay lost. The suggested itinerary is a varied one. Skirting the southern shore of the Black Sea, the first route supposedly led across the Dardanelles, and followed the Black Forest all the way to the German Sea, and then across to England. A second migration, we are told, might have passed over the Caucasus Mountains, and after some delay in what is called the "Land of Sojourn and Increase" far up to the Baltic Sea, found its way to Denmark and thence across to England. Still a third route is suggested far around the Caspian Sea, only to turn back and strike the path through Southern Germany to the Sea.  </p><p> But whether the propounders of these wild theories really regarded them as fact or fictional humor, they found adherents who were as ready to accept them with the same credence and authority, as if they had been culled directly from Holy Writ. As a matter of course, these absurd suggestions should all be classified with the report of Ibn Haukal, the famous traveller of the tenth century who would, to a certain extent, reverse the Darwinian Theory, by deriving monkeys from Jews, when he records : "Ableh is a small town, well inhabited, with a little tilled and cultivated land, 'In that place were some Jews; those to whom it was forbidden to hunt on the Sabbath ; and God transformed them, and caused them to become monkeys.' "  </p><p> Historically the obliteration of the Northern Kingdom Kingdom may he concisely told. The disintegration began when Tiglath-Pileser IV, the Assyrian monarch, in his campaign of 733-732 b. c. overthrew Damascus and invaded northern Israel.  In consequence of this invasion, J. M. Powis Smith  tells us : "Israel lost her territory east of the Jordan, the population of which was deported to Assyria."  </p><p> The ultimate destruction of the Northern Tribes was accomplished a few years later, when Sargon II in 722—721 b. c. completed the work that had been begun by his predecessor Shelmaneser IV, finally capturing Samaria which had held out for a three-years siege. The conqueror thus recorded his triumph : "I besieged and captured Samaria. I carried away 27,290 of its inhabitants, I collected there 50 chariots. The remains of them I permitted to retain their goods, put my governors over them, and I laid the tribute of former kings upon them."  In another record of the same event that has come down to us, Sargon expressly states: "I set up again and made more populous than before. People from lands which I had taken I settled there."  </p><p> Commenting on these cuneiform records of Sargon, Barton suggests: "Only 27,290 were transported at this time. . . . When we put together all those who were deported, however, they were but a fraction of the population. As Sargon distinctly says, the others remained there. They intermarried with the settlers whom he brought in and became the ancestors of the sect of Samaritans. The 'ten lost tribes' were not 'lost', as is often popularly supposed to be the case."  </p><p> Karl Kautsky, in his turn, comes to pretty much Remnants the same conclusion, as follows: "Not the entire Absorbed. population of the ten northern tribes of Israel were therefore carried off, but only the most distinguished inhabitants of the cities, which were then populated with strangers, but this was quite sufficient to destroy the nationality of these ten tribes ; for the peasant alone is incapable of constructing a specific communal life. The Israelitic city dwellers and aristocrats who were transplanted to Assyria and Media, on the other hand, disappeared in their new environment in the course of generations, becoming fused with it." </p><p> Doctor Gaster in the Schweich Lectures on BibiRehabilitation cal Archaeology for 1923 advanced the opinion of Samaria. that the settlers sent by Sargon were not in reality colonists in the strict sense of the word but mere military garrisons which were subsequently replaced by Persian troops.  But his arguments, based as they are solely on Samaritan traditions, such as the fact that they "repudiate entirely any connection with any heathen nation,"  are far from convincing. Doctor Gaster further states: "According to the Samaritan chronicles, a large number of exiles came back and settled in the land under the High Priest Abdael, no less than 37,000 being mentioned as having returned."  But he candidly admits that the number given must be an exaggeration. Besides, Powis Smith is emphatic in his assertion: "The downfall of Samaria brought about the end of the northern kingdom, which now became an Assyrian province. Natives of other parts of the Assyrian Empire were imported to take the place of the twenty-seven thousand deported citizens. The result was the rise of a mixed people in Northern Israel, who were mongrel in religion as well as in blood."  </p><p> Stanley A. Cook, too, is entirely in accord with this opinion. He further maintains that in 715 b. c. Sargon added to the mixture of races already located in Samaria by the introduction of Bedouin colonists from Arabia.  These with the other colonists from Assyria he finds intermarrying with the remnants of Israel "and their descendants might in time be regarded as truly remnants of Israel, even as the semi-Edomite clans that entered Judah were reckoned as Israelites."  Of the exiles from the Northern Kingdom, Cook concludes : "They were probably soon swallowed up in their new homes."  </p><p> Nothing is to be gained then, by trying to trace these Northern Tribes further at the present time.  Lacking the spirit of the Southern Kingdom, they quickly became assimilated and lost their identity being absorbed by the peoples with whom they dwelt.  </p><p> Before drawing this chapter to a close, however, a word must be said about the theory of those who would find among the American Indians evidences of descent from the ancient Hebrews. In one way the question is closely allied to that of the "Lost Tribes." And even in the case of those who postulate for the Indians a Judean origin, or at least a diffusion of Judean culture, the matter is best settled here, as it may easily becloud the treatment of our own subject if reserved until later. </p><p> The controversy was of Spanish origin almost to England immediately after the discovery of America, but eventually reached England, tea, or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race, was the title of a book written in 1648 by the Reverend T. Thorowgood who was interested in the efforts of the Reverend John Eliot to evangelize the Massachusetts Indians, and who hoped to help the work financially. Four years later, Hamon L' Estrange answered it with a little volume, Americans no J ewes, or Improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race. Thorowgood founded his conjecture on six arguments, which are thus summarized by L'Estrange: ") The Acknowledgment of the Americans. ) From Rites and Customs. ) From Words and Speech. ) From man-devouring. ) From the Conversion promised to the Jews. ) From the Calamities threatened to the Jews."  </p><p> Before considering these claims and refuting them in detail, L'Estrange first considers the source of the aborigines of America, and concludes : "Thus far have I offered my weak conceptions, first how America may be collected to have bin first planted, not denying the Jewes leave to goe into America, but not admitting them to be the chief or prime planters there ; for I am of opinion, that the Americans originally were before the Captivity of the Ten Tribes, even from Sem's near progeny."  </p><p> Contemporary with L'Estrange, George Horn discusses the possible descent of the American Indians from the Israelites, a theory which he also rejects.  </p><p> Meanwhile the question had been seriously taken up on the Continent, and popularized by one of the most brilliant Jews of the day. Manasseh Ben Israel, a native of La Rochelle, while yet a boy moved to Amsterdam with his parents, early in the seventeenth century. In due course he became one of the most distinguished orators in Holland, and established the first Hebrew printing press in that country in 1626. Through the influence of a fellow Jew, Aaron Levi, better known as Antonio de Montezinos, Manasseh became a strong advocate of the theory that the North American Indians were in fact the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.  With a view of securing the readmission of the Jews into England, Manasseh published a volume entitled "Esperanca de Israel."  Written originally in Spanish, this work was quickly translated into Latin and English, and exercised a great influence, though it failed in its original purpose of opening England to the Jews. However, at the national conference at Whitehall in December 1655, it brought out the fact that their exclusion was not sanctioned by English Law, and incidentally gained many outspoken advocates to the general theory of the Israelitic origin of the American Indians. </p><p> For some time, missionaries in America, esReportsf  pecially those in Mexico, had been sending home reports of religious customs and beliefs that savored much of Semitic origin. Thus the Jesuit Acosta reported that the Indians had an infinite number of ceremonies and usages which reminded one of the ancient Law of Moses.  </p><p> But it was reserved for Viscount Kingsborough, who £ alnered a tliese testimonies into a single volume, to become the real propounder of the theory, that would trace to a Semitic source those Indian customs and traditions. Thus he writes : "It is impossible on reading what Mexican mythology records of the war in Heaven and of the fall of Zontemoque and the other rebellious spirits, of the creation of light by the word of Tonacatecutli and of the division of the waters, of the sin of Yztlacohuhqui and his blindness and nakedness, of the temptation of Suchiquecal and her disobedience in gathering roses from a tree, and of the consequent misery and disgrace of herself and all her posterity, not to recognize scriptural analogies. But the Mexican tradition of the deluge is that which bears unequivocal marks of having been derived from a Hebrew source."  The Viscount then develops the Mexican idea of the deluge and its subsequent events, such as the Tower of Babel and the dispersion of nations, in parallel with the Bible Story. </p><p> In due time, Brasseur de Bourbourg became an \ardent defender of Kingborough's views. </p><p> Among others, too, Hubert Howe Bancroft describes in detail what he regards as authentic Hebrew relics found in what is now the United States,  and John T. Sharp establishes, at least to his own satisfaction, numerous analogies between Jewish and Mexican codes and customs, that are certainly striking.  </p><p> On the contrary, De Roo, who has made a special Opponents. study of the subject, after discussing the whole question at some length, and giving due credit to all authorities cited, as well as quoting many others, unreservedly rejects their claim, and concludes: "For these and similar reasons, which the reader can easily find in several other works, we are of opinion that the first Jews who ever set foot on American soil were those who, in spite of the restrictions of Ferdinand and Isabella, secretly went on board the ships which Colombus and his contemporaries steered to the New World." Yet De Roo subsequently admits certain seem Concessions. </p><p> ingly Hebraic customs among the American Aborigines. Thus, after rejecting the claims of two Hebrew practices in America, he concedes: "Other souvenirs of Jewish history and rites of the Mosaic law seem to have been real, and to have actually existed among a few of America's aboriginal nations. Thus are the Yucatecs said to have had a tradition according to which they originally came from the far East, passing through the sea which God had made dry for them."  And again : "We may close this chapter with the remark that the Mexicans celebrated the Jewish feast of the New Year, and had their festivity of the Remission of Sins and the use of sacred unctions as the Jews."  </p><p> De Roo further qualifies his position by the statement : "We do not, however, intend to say that the western portion of the Old World had no share at all in America's greatness before the Christian era."  He even admits : "Not a few writers defend the opinion that the Egyptians, who sailed around Africa and far away into the Indian and the Atlantic Ocean, left in America some architectural and linguistic vestiges of their presence,"  and conceives the possibility of the Phoenicians, whether Tyrians or Carthaginians, having also reached the American continent. Pcra Speaking of the "remarkable parallel to the </p><p> Egyptian development" which "is to be found in comparatively recent times in the Inca monarchy of Peru," Professor Dawson, the Oxford Historian, observes : "If it was the result of purely independent South American development, it is one of the most remarkable examples of convergent evolution in history. According to the hjpothesis of Mr. Ferry  and Professor Elliot Smith,  the elements of this culture were actually derived from Egypt, and were introduced into South America by the same race of megalith builders who have left traces of their presence throughout the Pacific from Easter Island to the Carolines. Now the monarchy of Japan, the rulers of which also claim to be Children of the Sun, was undoubtedly founded by megalith builders who arrived by sea, not long before the Christian era, and it is not impossible that the same influence may have reached the Pacific Coast of America. But the gap in time and space between this prehistoric Pacific culture and the historic civilization of ancient Egypt is so great that it is difficult to affirm any direct cultural influence on the part of the latter in the present state of our knowledge."  </p><p> Finally, A. L. Kroeber, after asserting: "The ConchSons American race can hardly have come from anywhere else than Asia,"  adds : "About the end of the Palaeolithic or beginning of the Neolithic some of the protomongoloids drifted from Asia into North America. These were probably the real discoverers of the New World, which they found inhabited only by brutes/   He later states : "Since the early culture importation of the period of the settlement of America eight or ten thousand years ago, the influences of the Old World have always been slight as compared with the independent developments within the New World. Even within the northwestern segment of North America, the bulk of culture would seem to have been evolved on the spot. But mingled with this local growth, more or less modifying it in the nearer regions, and reaching its greatest strength among the Eskimo, has been a trickling of series of later Asiatic influences which it would be mistaken wholly to overlook."  </p><p> island expanses of Melanesia and Polynesia to the remote countries of Mexico and Peru: this idea, however alluring, would require a delicate technique and categorical demonstration before it could claim serious attention. The methods used by Elliot Smith are, on the contrary, so loose that the entire speculative edifice erected by him can at best be regarded as another link, in that chain of top-heavy hypotheses born of uncontrolled flights of the imagination and unchecked by either patient research or a strict method of procedure."  </p><p> With this somewhat lengthy preamble, we are now rea< ty to withdraw from the grotesque and fantastic, to take up, in the next chapter, the real question of the Diaspora, tracing in roughest outline, within the realms of reasonable probability, the wanderings of that race or people whose dispersion is regarded by some as the means chosen by Divine Providence to prepare the way for Christianity, by drawing back to the primitive monotheistic idea the pagan world that had become corrupt, and through unbridled lusts sunk deep into the polytheistic practices of sensuous idolatry. </p><p> For, as Professor George Foot Moore has well Influence observed: "Among the Oriental religions which made successful propaganda in the first century before the Christian era and the first century after it, Judaism was not the least important. The ubiquitousness of the race had its part in this; but the chief cause lay in the character of the religion. Its monotheism was of a type to which the popular philosophies all tended ; indeed the synagogue, with its gathering for the study of the Law and the Prophets, seemed much more like a school of philosophy than like religious worship or the ritual of a mystery. The possession of these sacred scriptures, descended from an antiquity by the side of which the beginnings of Greek philosophy were modern, and derived from divine revelation, made a doubly profound impression upon an age which turned its eyes to the ancients for wisdom and to heaven for a truth beyond the attainment of reason. The Jewish life, with its multitudinous observances and its meticulous precautions against pollution from unclean men and things, had nothing strange or unreasonable about it when not only religious sects but philosophical schools made diet and dress and rules of intercourse an essential part of their discipline."  </p><p> Indians were descended from the Ten Tribes of Israel, and that an exodus of Jews from Jerusalem took place prior to the birth of Christ, and carried away the records, a part of which was the Book of Mormon. This book, it is asserted, was discovered by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the side of a hill, called Cumorrah, in Ontario County, New York, </p><p> 
<p>
</p><p> Chapter VI</p><p>  THE DIASPORA </p><p> At all ages, Israelites, either individually or in small groups, must have taken up their residence in the land of strangers. In fact, George A. Barton writes: "It appears from I Kings, xx, 84 1 that an Israelitish colony was established in Damascus in the reign of Ahab. (i. e. About 900 b. c.) Possibly the similar alliances of David and Solomon with Phoenicia had established similar colonies there."  And Stanley A, Cook, when speaking of the time of the Babylonian Captivity, observes : "Apart from the Judaean exiles themselves, it is not impossible that by this time Jews, whether associated with their Phoenician brethren or not, were beginning to be found scattered over the known world."  </p><p> With reason then, Lewis Browne, in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem, takes care to note: "The scattering of the Jews through foreign lands — the Diaspora as it is usually called — had already been in process for many centuries before the fall of Jerusalem. Perhaps as early as the days of Solomon there were little colonies of Hebrew traders in strange lands. Certainly there were many after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722 B. c. and still more after the destruction of the Southern Kingdom in  b. c. Indeed some scholars say that from that last date on, there were always more Jews living outside the borders of Palestine than within them." </p><p> And Ewald, the historian, states: "The 'Exile' in this wider sense begins as early as the tenth and ninth centuries, long before the destruction of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes; for great numbers were carried away as prisoners of war and subsequently for the most part sold as slaves, and many who sank through internal commotions took to more or less voluntary flight. ... In particular the 'Coasts of the Sea/ i. e. the numerous maritime districts and islands of the Mediterranean, are now (as in the eighth century) frequently mentioned as a residence of the Dispersion. The extensive trade of the neighboring Phoenicians had long been directed to these countries, which now appear for the first time in the history of Israel, and many who were not sold as slaves followed the example of the Phoenicians, and went thither of their own free will."  </p><p> While then, from an early period, there must have been scattered throughout the known world individuals and even considerable groups of the Children of Israel, from the Northern Kingdom as Avell as from the Southern, the term Diaspora or Dispersion is technically restricted to the tribe of Juda, from whom the modern Jew is supposed to have sprung. Barton makes this clear in stating: "The real Dispersion began with the Babylonian Exile. Nebuchadnezzar transplanted to Babylonia the choicest of the Judaean population. Probably 50,000 were transplanted, and Jewish communities were formed in Babylonia at many points, as at Tel-abib and Casephia. Here the Jewish religion was maintained; . . . and from this centre Jews radiated to many parts of the East. Thus the Jews reached Media, Persia, Cappadocia, Armenia, and the Black Sea. Only a few of these Babylonian Jews returned to Palestine. They maintained the Jewish Communities in Babylonia till about a. d. 1000." It is here interesting to remark in passing, that as late as the middle of the tenth century, we find the Arabian Traveller, Ibn Haukal, describing a Jewish kingdom at Atel near the Caspian Sea, and noting : "The smallest in number of the inhabitants of this country are the Jews; the greatest in number are the Mussulmans and Christians ; but the king and his chief officers are Jews." Without a doubt, the kingdom referred to was that of the Mongol Chazars. As we shall see later, this people was converted to Judaism in the middle of the eighth century. Consequently, they were Jews not by race, but only by adoption. </p><p> Of the fall of Jerusalem, Mercer records: Jerusalem "Nabuchadrezzar was a great builder and architect, and consequently most of his inscriptions deal with building operations. We know, however, from Biblical sources that he interfered in Judaean affairs, and this is confirmed by some of his inscriptions. </p><p> "Jehoiakim, against the advice of Jeremiah, revolted and Jerusalem was besieged in 597. Jehoiakim died in the meantime and Jehoiachin, his successor, surrendered and was taken with many other captives to Babylonia and settled in a place near the canal Kebar near Nippur. About a decade later Hophra (Apries) of Egypt induced Judah and some other small neighboring states to revolt. This called down the wrath of Nabuchadrezzar who laid siege to Jerusalem in 587, and although he was called off to defeat Hophra succeeded in returning and capturing the city in 586 b. c. Zedekiah was taken captive to Riblah, where his eyes were put out, and Gedaliah was made governor of the city."  </p><p> As Kautsky remarks: "Very probably the entire population was not taken away this time either; but all the population of Jerusalem was taken away. At any rate, most of the country population was left. But what was left ceased to constitute a specific Jewish community. The entire national life of the Jews was now concentrated in the city-dwellers now living in exile." </p><p> Of the days of sojourn in Babylon, we need say Harold Hunting writes: "When they reached the land of their captors they were not made slaves, but were allowed to make their home together in settlements on land set apart for them. In these colonies they probably worked as tenant-farmers on the estates of Nebuchadnezzar's nobles. In the prophetic book of Ezekiel, who was among the exiles, we read about one of these Jewish colonies by the river or canal, called Chebar (or in Babylonian Kabary), which means the Grand Canal."  And again: "Many Hebrews, or Jews (that is Hebrews from Judaea), became merchants. . . . The reputation of the Jews for cleverness in trade began with these experiences in Babylon when hundreds of Jewish boys obtained positions in great Babylonian stores and banks, and by and by set up for themselves as merchants. Among the Babylonian contracts on clay tablets coming down to us from this period are many Jewish names"  </p><p> On the other hand, the period of the Babylonian Captivity was characterized by a rejuvenation of the religious spirit of Juda, and the prophets of the Exile left a lasting impress on the Nation. No matter what their previous practices had been, idolatry never again became a national crime, although, it is true, it was still to have its devotees in private. </p><p> When, at length, Cyrus permitted the Exiles to return to their own country, it was principally the poorer and more fervent element apparently that availed itself of the privilege.  The wealthier class, for the most part, rather chose to remain in Babylonia, and established there a numerous and influential community, which was to endure for 1500 years.  </p><p> Powis Smith clearly explains the reason for all: "There is good reason to think that the Jews in Babylonia had prospered. They had acted upon the advice given them in Jeremiah's letter,  and built themselves into the economic and industrial life of the Babylonian community as a whole. They had all their investments and business interests in Babylonia. The proposition to pull up stakes, sell out, and start all over again in a new and far-off location would not appeal with great force to successful Jewish merchants or farmers in Babylonia. Another difficulty in the way of the creation of great enthusiasms for the return movement lay in the fact that most of the original exiles of 597 and 586 b. c. must have died before 538 b. c. Very few of the exiles of 538 b. c. had ever seen Jerusalem or Judah. Those who had once lived there had left it so early in life as to have forgotten practically all about it. They had lived in Babylonia practically all their lives and in no real sense ever thought of Judah as 'home.' They were content where they were; or if not wholly satisfied, probably thought it 'better to bear the ills they had than to fly to ills they knew not of.' It is not probable that there was any degree of homesickness among the Jewish population of 538 b. c. A still further element working against the creation of a general desire to return to Palestine was the length of the arduous journey. ... It would appear, therefore, that there was no concerted movement to return in large numbers, but that the return movements were confined to small groups of enthusiasts or malcontents who trickled back to Judah from time to time as occasion served. These made no marked impress upon the life of the Jerusalem community, for they were too few in number, and probably also too insignificant in character and ability, to count for much in the group as a whole."  </p><p> Cyrus had liberated the Jews in 538 b. c. but it was not for another eighty years, until the reign of Artaxerxes I, that there was anything like a migration from Babylonia to Palestine.  In fact it was only in 458 b. c, that Esdras led back the remnants of the people, on which he was to build up the Nation anew. And even then large numbers of Jews made their choice to remain in Babylonia and Mesopotamia,  unwilling to sacrifice their ease and comfort.</p><p> Palestine is politically an uninterrupted alternation of partial successes and reverses, and only too frequently we find her the innocent victim of circumstances, due to her position as a natural obstruction on the path that the battling nations of East and West were forced to take in their interminable conflicts for world supremacy. Thus, Theodore Reinach relates : "During the wars of the third and second centuries b. c. thousands of Jews were made captive and reduced to slavery, passing from owner to owner and from land to land until their enfranchisement. This enfranchisement indeed usually occurred very soon, it being precipitated by the fact that, through their unswerving attachment to their customs, they proved indifferent servants. . . . The Jews thus freed, instead of returning to Palestine, usually remained in the land of their former slavery, and there, in conjunction with their brethren in faith, established communities." ia And again : "Thus as early as the middle of the second century b. c. the Jewish author of the third book of the Oracula Sibyllina, addressing the chosen people says : 'Every land is full of thee and every sea/  and if these words contain any exaggeration, the prophecy became true in the subsequent century. The most diverse witnesses, such as Strabo, Philo, Seneca, the author of the Acts of the Apostles, and Josephus, all bear testimony to the fact that the Jewish race was disseminated over the whole civilized world."  </p><p> Karl Kautsky finds another reason for the wideMCTchants spread infiltration of the Jews. According to his view : "The 'Diaspora': the dispersal of the Jews throughout the world, certainly does not begin as late as the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, nor with the Babylonian Exile, but much earlier; it is a natural consequence of trade, a phenomenon shared by the Jews with most commercial peoples."  Quoting from Franz Buhl,  Kautsky had previously explained : "Even before the Israelites came to Canaan, trade was highly developed in this country. In the Tell-el-Amarna Letters (of the fifteenth Century before Christ) caravans are mentioned that travelled through the country under armed protection."  And in a later volume, he further developed his idea of the mercantile propensity of the Jews. He says in part: "It was too small and weak, the superior power of its neighbours too crushing, to enable Palestine to dispose of its population by settling it in conquered regions. The territory of the Phoenicians cut Palestine oil from good seaports and the practice of navigation. Therefore the path of colonization beyond the seas was also closed to the Israelites. Their surplus population had no other alternative than to go abroad as merchants (sometimes as mercenaries, but these played no important part in history). In this capacity, they travelled further and further and founded a number of settlements. In many cities they became so numerous as to conduct not only trading operations, but also to employ artisans of their own; the number of their intellectuals also increased. </p><p> Constantly crowded and congested in their homeland by the overwhelming strength of their neighbours, this little race had no other path of expansion. This path was pursued so energetically that the Israelitic population abroad finally became more numerous than the home population. The home population repeatedly loses its status as an independent nation, finally losing it forever. But before this time has come, the centre of gravity of Judaism had been shifted from its original location to a number of cities in Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia."  </p><p> \These Jewish Colonies expanded, according to the same author, not only by natural increase, but also by assimilation of neophytes. Thus he explains: 'Those who subjected themselves permanently to the Jewish rite might be depended on as reliable fellow-members. But every stranger was welcome who would recognise this rite — without regard to origin. Jewish exclusiveness was not an exclusiveness of race. The Jewish propaganda in all regions of the ancient world was rather calculated to stimulate tremenduously the mingling of races within Judaism."  And again : "A mixed race from the very start, the Jews, in the course of their migrations, have come into contact with a great succession of new races and their blood has become more and more mixed."  </p><p> It was the religious bond, the living tradition that they were Yahweh's Chosen People, that held the Jews together amid all their infidelities, and not only preserved them in a distinct social entity, but led to the ready assimilation of the alien elements which were constantly being absorbed through infiltration from without. For, while the violations of the Mosaic exclusiveness were only too frequent even from the earliest days in Palestine, as we shall shortly see in detail, yet in the great mass of the people there was shown a remarkable fidelity in this respect, and even in the case of intermarriage, it was as a rule, the gentile who became a Jew, and not a case of perversion or formal apostasy on the part of the Israelite. </p><p> Kautsky's view of the Jew's early application to commerce, is further substantiated by an observation of G. F. Abbott, who notes: "As early as the fourth century b. c. we find the Hebrew word for 'earnest-money' domiciled in the Greek language,  and as early as the second century in the Latin (arrhabo) — a curious illustration of the Jew's commercial activity in the Mediterranean even in those days."  </p><p> Another interesting phase of Kautsky's theory is the fact that he so fearlessly goes counter to the popular impression that Deuteronomical exclusiveness has, in the main, effectively restricted marital intercourse between Jew and for long been fertile themes for discussion. The traditional view has always been that they were a true Semitic people, and, indeed, the term Semite has popularly come to be practically synonymous with Jew. They were regarded as a people whose purity of blood had, in spite of wide dispersion, been jealously preserved throughout the centuries. As soon, however, as detailed investigations in regard to Jewish physical types began to be available, it appeared that it was extremely doubtful whether either of these assumptions was true, for the Jews proved to be by no means uniform in their physical characteristics, and the great majority appeared to be of a different type from that found among other Semitic-speaking peoples." — Dixon, Racial History of Man, p. 162. Then after a careful study of all available data, Dixon come to the rather startling deduction that the Jews of to-day practically are Semites in language only, and thus preserved racially the Children of Israel unto our own day.  </p><p> But, as a matter of fact, the Scriptures themselves show that, not only was marriage with the Gentile commonly practiced in the early history of the Hebrew People, but that it was at times directly approved of in the Law itself. Of Jacob's sons, Juda certainly took a Canaanite and Joseph married an Egyptian.  The children of Israel numbered seventy souls at the time when they came into Gessen,  and of these, the three sons and two grandsons of Juda;  Saul, the son of Simeon ;  and the two sons of Joseph — eight in all — were without question of mixed blood. Of the other sons of Jacob, sonic at least, in all probability, had wedded Canaanites. For the Tell-elAmarna Letters show that the Khabiri,  who are, as far as we know, the only Tribes akin to the Israelites, and even that is questionable, did not invade Canaan until the Children of Israel were in Egypt*  While then, individuals or small groups of kindred race may have been in contact with Jacob and his immediate family, still the presumption is that the other sons followed the example of Juda and Joseph in their choice of wives. </p><p> At the time of the Exodus, 430 years after the Israelites had taken up their residence in Gessen,  the original band of seventy had grown into a nation numbering 600,000 men besides children. 38 During this period there must have been constant intermarrying with the Egyptians and other outsiders. Moses' wife was a Midianite,  and even after the Exodus, circumcision was to make the stranger as one of the land.  </p><p> According to the command of God, the seven nations within the confines of the Promised Land were to be utterly exterminated,  and no marriage might be contracted with them.  But as regards the other nations outside the confines of the Promised Land, treaties might be made with them,  and in case of war, their children might be taken by the Israelites,  and be eligible as wives.  Nay more, children begotten of Edomites or Egyptians, in the third generation, were to gain full membership in the congregation.  </p><p> Despite the command to exterminate the original dwellers in the Promised Land, the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin,  and the other proscribed nations became tributaries to the Israelites.  Consequently, as might be expected, they gradually intermarried.  Thus, for example, Samson chose as wife a Philistine.  </p><p> Professor Moore positively asserts : "The sorp on. Canaanite population had been absorbed in Israel by intermarriage"  and Jobs Pederson, in reference to what he calls the Davidic Empire, says : "The Israelitic communities are merged in an empire which, it is true, was Israelitic and had the God of Israel as its imperial God, but this empire also included the non-Israelitic inhabitants of the country. A non-Israelitic city, Jerusalem, was made the capital of the country, and David surrounded himself with many foreigners. He was the ruler of a country and an empire, and we hear of no antagonism between Israelites and Canaanites in his empire, it can only mean that the Canaanites were merged into the Israelitic unity and thus disappeared, naturally infusing Canaanite life and culture into Israel. And so nearly every trace of the Canaanites vanishes, while at the same time Israel becomes more Canaanite."  Later, while speaking of marriage, Professor Pederson adds: "The demand that marriages should take place only among those of the same kin is not absolute, and there is even ample evidence that the Israelites had connubium with other peoples. Through that fusion the Israelitic empire was created."  </p><p> Kin David  S  '  nc * ers P etr  e shows from the Tell-el' Amarna letters, especially those from Abdikhiba, King of Jerusalem, "Jerusalem was not merely a Jebusite village made into a capital by David and Solomon, but was the capital of south Palestine from early times.  From the accounts of the state of Palestine at the Israelite invasion it appears that the Amorites held most of the country. ... By the time of the Israelite invasion, the Amorites were paramount in the whole of Palestine."  When King David then, took many concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after its capture, ft they must have been for the most part Jebusites or Amorites — certainly Gentiles. His favorite son Absalom was, through his mother, grandson to the King of Gessur," and Solomon's mother was Bethsabee, the former wife of Urias the Hethite,  whom David had sent to his death. Solomon Solomon, in turn, first married the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh,  and subsequently took many wives and concubines from the very nations specifically prohibited by God,  and his son Roboam, who was to succeed him, had an Ammonite as his mother.  </p><p> In this connection Max L. Margolis writes : "Solomon was devoted to the service of the God of his fathers. Reasons of state, however, compelled him to enter into alliance with many foreign powers. His harem contained, in addition to the Egyptian princess, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. Jerusalem was in his conception to be a city in which all these nations should feel at home. For their benefit he built chapels in which they might worship their gods. State interests clashed with a rigid interpretation of Mosaism."  </p><p> Despite then, the sacredness of the Mosaic Law delusiveness. Exclusiveness, its disregard and violation was at times fairly common. This was especially true during the period of the Babylonian Captivity, in the case of the handful of Jews who still lingered in Palestine. They naturally mingled with the hybrid population of Samaria, with whom they claimed a distant kinship, and their example was followed by some of those who first returned from Babylon, until Esdras began to firmly enforce the Law,  </p><p> It was this condition of affairs, perhaps, that led Doctor Krausse to assert : "In view of the undoubted fact that the Jewish inhabitants of Babylonia were of purer racial extraction than the Jews of Palestine, the former considered themselves, especially after the fall of Jerusalem, as the genuine Israel, and their differing traditions and customs as of higher authority than those of the home-country."  confirmed by an observation of Professor Breasted, that "the prominent aquiline nose, still considered to be the mark of the Semite, especially of the Jew, was really a feature belonging to the (non-Semitic) Hittites, who intermarried with the people of Palestine and gave them this Hittite type of face."  </p><p> What is the wonder then, that Nehemias should complain that the children of mixed marriages were unable to speak Hebrew?  Moreover, Doctor Gaster adopts the opinion that SamaMis "intermarriage had taken place between the Jews and Samaritans down to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, not only among the lower classes but also among the highest in the land and the leaders of the Jews.'  He finds in this fact a confirmation of his theory that the Samaritans were of pure Israelitic stock. While rejecting his theory in the matter, his admission is useful to our present purpose. </p><p> We can understand then, the remark of Max L, Margolis : "Often the language of one people is acquired by another of a totally different stock. When, therefore, we speak of Semites, we have in mind solely their speech and culture, not the form of the skull or facial expression. If at all there was a primitive Semitic stock, its earliest habitat is a matter of conjecture, Nowhere, not even in Arabia, were the people of Semitic speech indigenous to the soil. It seems probable that at divers periods in remote antiquity they had migrated from somewhere in Central Asia.'  </p><p> Eugene Pittard, Professor of Anthropology at the Nmi-istent, University of Geneva, after a careful study of the subject, was led to the conclusion that such a thing as a pure race is non-existent to-day, and that even at the period commonly known as the beginning of historical times, practically every nation was already an ethnic complex. Thus he asserts, for example: "Primitive races became mixed from the time that the wanderings of humanity over the continents became intensive. Up till the Mesolithic, Western Europe knew only Dolichocephals — of different types, it is true. The arrival of the first Brachycephals profoundly disturbed this relative unity. From that day forward — and the mingling increased progressively as time goes on — it is impossible to speak of pure races as regards Europe"  </p><p> Professor Dixon is quite of the same opinion. He writes : "By migration and conquest the original racial factors, whatever they were, have been so interwoven and blended that the vast majority of all living men must have a complex racial ancestry, and such a thing as a pure race can hardly be expected to live.'  And again : "There is not a race in all history that has remained permanently unchanged, although the rate and degree of change have varied. Some races have retained their fundamental characteristics for millenia with but slight modifications, whereas others have, as a resuit of the incorporation of new factors, ceased to exist, because by virtue of such amalgamation they have become something else."  </p><p> Concerning the Jews, Professor Pittard expresses this view: not know what specialists think about the influence that may be attributed to the Jewish people in the general history of the Oriental peoples. It seems to me that if we take into consideration the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel only, the influence would appear to be a small one. Can we not say that it is thanks to their very dispersion that the Jews, in certain circumstances, have been more or less important factors in History as a whole? It has developed upon individuals and groups and not on the nation to exercise a frequently decisive influence. For anthropologists, though they may consider certain Jews to be inspired by the Israelitish racial idea, all Jews are very far from belonging to the 'Jewish race/ There is no such thing, said Renan, as a Jewish type — there are Jewish types. Nothing would be more true. We cannot consider the Jews to-day — not even in Palestine, because the Sionist movement has imported all kinds and conditions of Israelites — as constituting a homogeneous ethnic group. The Jews belong to a religious and social community to which, in every period, individuals of different races have attached themselves. These Judaized people have come from every kind of ethnic stratum, such as the Falashas of Abyssinia and the Germans of Germanic type; or the Tamils — Black Jews — of India, and the Khazars, who are supposed to be of Turki race."  </p><p> A little later the same author ascribes the large  number of Jews scattered throughout the world at present not merely to "a natural excess of births over deaths during historic times,*' but rather* to "the incorporation of other more or less large populations" and adds: "On many occasions entire groups have become Judaized and thus contributed their numbers and their eugenic qualities to the Israelite contingent."  </p><p> This is precisely Kautsky's opinion also. He tells us early as Jews were deported from Rome because they had made proselytes in Italy. </p><p> It is reported from Antioch that the majority of the Jewish congregation in that town consisted of converted Jews, not of Jews by birth. Conditions must have been similar in many other places. This fact alone shows the absurdity of the effort to explain the traits of the Jews on the basis of their race.  </p><p> Finally, after a careful comparison of data noRace    gathered from the various Jewish groups throughout the world, Professor Pittard concludes: "It seems to us that the least informed reader will come to the conclusion that no Jewish race, in the zoological sense of the word, exists. The Israelites constitute a religious and social community, certainly very strong and very coherent ; but its elements are heterogeneous in the extreme. In face of certain ethnic analyses, we may even ask ourselves to what extent this and that Jewish group includes any typical Jews — those who, in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, constituted that zealous people so familiar to us — the Chosen People."  </p><p> Griffith Taylor, in his turn, comes to pretty much the same conclusion.  He writes: "There is of course little relationship between the original Semitic Jews of Syria and the Russian Jew of Poland and the vicinity. Ripley explains this diversity mainly by an extensive proselytising movement among the Southern Russians in the early centuries of our era. Indeed he affirms that the 'Jews are not a race, but only a people. ... In long-headed Africa they were dolichocephals, in brachycephalic Piedmont they were quite like the Italians of Turin, and all over Slavic Europe no distinction between Jew and Christian existed.' "  </p><p> The vulgar notion of the Indogermans and Semites being in radical contrast to one another is at any rate quite untenable. The close physical kinship of these two racial groups has, on the contrary, been established beyond dispute by anthropological research, and the more information we get on the prehistoric cultures of Western Asia, the more it becomes evident that numerous contacts and crossings must have taken place. The Jews then, during the whole course of their history, always absorbed appreciable infiltrations of foreign blood, a fact which partly explains the variegations of types one meets among them, and also their partial assimilation to the physical types of the nations they live among." — Friedrich Hertz, Race and Civilisation, trans. Levetus and Entz, London, 1928, p. 133, </p><p> Well, then, does Kautsky argue: "It is only in a condition of compulsory exclusion from their environment, and under political pressure, deprived of their rights and surrounded by hostility, that the Jews can maintain themselves among other peoples. They will dissolve, unite with their environment and disappear where the Jew is regarded and treated as a free man and as an equal"  And once more: "When the artificial exclusiveness of the Jews is terminated, when the ghetto ceases to exist, their assimilation will become everywhere inevitable."  The very hardships of the Ghetto thus find their own reward. </p><p> This apparently was already, to a certain extent, becoming the condition of things in the early days of the Christian era, when, as Reinach assures us : "The great Jewish insurrections under Vespasion, Trajan, and Hadrian, terminating, as they did so disastrously, threw upon the market myriads of Jewish captives. Transported to the West, the}' became the nuclei of communities in Italy, Spain, Gaul, etc. Amongst these captives was the historian of the Jewish people, Flavins Josephus."  And this same Flavius Josephus, who must ever be regarded among the Jews as a renegade, is but an example of what foreign influence in his time was effecting everywhere throughout the Dispersion. </p><p> Then, too, the whole language question afforded Difficulties another means of ultimately destroying racial exclusiveness, at least among the Jews scattered abroad. Again Kautsky may be quoted to advantage. "The Jews living abroad had to speak the foreign tongue, and if several generations had already been living abroad, the younger generations finally would be able to speak only the language of their native country, forgetting their mother tongue. Greek particularly became very popular among them. Already in the Third Century B. c. the sacred writings of the Jews were translated into Greek, probably for the reason that but few Alexandrian Jews still understood Hebrew and possibly also for purposes of propaganda among the Greeks. Greek became the language of the new Jewish literature, and even the language of the Jewish people living in Italy. 'The different (Jewish) communities in Rome had burial grounds in common, five of which are known. The inscriptions are mainly in Greek, some written in an almost unintelligible jargon; some are in Latin, none in Hebrew.'  The Jews were not able to maintain the use of Hebrew even in Palestine, where they adopted the language of the population surrounding them, which was Aramaic. Several centuries before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, Hebrew already ceased to be a living tongue. It no longer served as a means of communication between the members of the nation, but only as a means of access to the sacred writings of antiquity."  </p><p> So, too, Van den Bissen remarks: "In Mesopotamia the Jews read and studied the Bible in Hebrew. This was comparatively easy for them since Chaldee, their vernacular, was kindred to the Hebrew. The Jews in Egypt, and throughout Europe, commonly called Hellenistic Jews, soon forgot Hebrew. A Greek version of the Bible, the Septuagint, was made for them. The consequence was that they were less ardent in the punctilious observance of their Law. Like the Samaritans they showed a schismatic tendency by erecting a rival temple to that in Jerusalem, ... It is a curious fact that whereas Hellenistic Judaism became the soil in which Christianity took root and waxed strong, the colony in Babylonia remained a stronghold of orthodox Judaism and produced its famous Talmud.'   </p><p> In any case, the diffusion of the Jews throughout greatly increased after the final destruction of Jerusalem. Sidney Mendelssohn sought to trace these various migrations both in Asia,  and in Africa.  In due course we shall study Africa in detail, but space will permit only a passing reference here to a few of the Asiatic colonies. Of these, perhaps the most famous are the Black Jews of Cochin and the Beni Israel of India.  While the extreme claim of the latter is a lineal descent from the exiles of the Ten Tribes, the former are even more pretentious in their demands, which are thus set forth by the JEWISH WORLD, under the caption "The Black Jews in India." "The majority are natives of the Malabar coast, where, especially in the city of Kotschin, they reside in considerable numbers. It is said they are the descendants of the Jews who were sent to India by King Solomon to capture elephants for his use and to work in the gold mines ; and that their skins in the course of three thousand years have entirely changed color, so as to make it almost impossible to distinguish them from the rest of the natives."  </p><p> According to Julius Kernan, "A unique group of Jews are the Beni Israel — the Black Jews of India. They know very little of their own history. Most of them, 8,000 in number, live in Bombay. In Dahomey, they have a temple where they still offer sacrifices. They observe the Sabbath scrupulously. They know the books of Moses, but no other literature."  </p><p> As a matter of fact, the probability is that these Jews in India came originally from Minorca whither they had fled from Jeritsa in the time of Titus.  Their color, etc, may be accounted for by inbreeding with the natives. Here is another instance of the steady assimilation of the race. </p><p> Of almost equal interest are the Jews of China Jews of China, with a well-organized synagogue dating back to obscurity,  Some would trace this portion of the Diaspora back to travellers through Persia in the time of Antiochus the Great (sixth century b. c), but seemingly with more reason others ascribe the origin to Talmudist Jews of Babylonia, However Kaufman Kohler believes that "their celebration of the New Moon as a festival is proof of pre-Talmudistic tradition,"  and it is not without reason that he concludes :  "It is as hazardous to connect the first Jewish settlement in China with the Lost Ten Tribes  as it is unwarranted scepticism to doubt the correctness of the Chinese Jews themselves, which traces the first immigration back to the Han dynasty between 206 b. c. and 221 c. e. and more exactly to the time of the emperor Ming-ti."  </p><p> Henri Cordier thus describes the discovery of Discovery these Jews in China: "At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the celebrated Father Matthew Ricci, the founder of the missions of the Jesuits at Pekin, received the visit of a young Jew ; who declared to him that he adored only a single God- He mistook at the mission the image of the Virgin with the Infant Jesus for that of Rebecca with Esau or Jacob, and said that he came from Kai-foung-f ou, in the province of Honan, where there sojourned ten or twelve families of his religion, having their synagogue, in which they had preserved books written in a language similar to that of a Bible which Ricci showed to him : this last was in Hebrew."  </p><p> Deniker observes: "It has been said and frequently repeated that the Jews who migrated to Cochin (India), after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, had become as black as the native Tamils in the midst of whom they lived. The assertion is so contrary to fact that they give in the country the name of 'White Jews' to the descendants of true Jev.s (and who are \\hite in reality), to distinguish them from the 'Black Jews' or Tamils converted to Judaism." </p><p> the Vulgate as "the south country," whence the deported sons of Israel shall return to their land. — . c, p. . If his reference is restricted to rabbinical commentators the remark perhaps may be allowed to pass unchallenged.  Idem, p. . </p><p> Frequent reference is made to this curious people by the early Jesuit Missionaries in China, such as Matthew Ricci, who arrived in China about 1581 to found the Pekin Mission. Gonzani, Brotier, and others, also often mention them and conjecture concerning their origin. But here again, we have evidence of intermarriage and general adaption to environment noticed among similar Jewish colonies elsewhere. Thus James Finn  states that these Chinese Jews "were not particular in regard to eating forbidden animals," and Henri Cordier makes it clear that by the middle of the last century they were Jewish in name only, and that they had "intermarried outside the faith and preserved only a few ceremonies and names of holy days."  Cordier had become acquainted at Shanghai with some of the descendants of the original colony, and he further tells us: "Two of them have become Mandarins, professing Confusianism, at least in form; and another is a Bhuddist priest."  </p><p> Still another group, that have been already reChazaxs. f erred to, are the Mongol Chazars of whom Madison Grant writes in his Introduction to Doctor Stoddard's work, "The Rising Tide of Color against White World-Supremacy": "Other Tatar and Mongoloid tribes settled in south-eastern and eastern Russia. Chief amongst these were the Mongol Chazars who founded an extensive and powerful empire in southern and south-eastern Russia as early as the eighth century. It is interesting to note that they accepted Judaism and became the ancestors of the majority of the Jews of Eastern Europe, the round-headed Ashkenazim."  </p><p> Of the Jewish battalions in the Persian Armies, SttaSons. we need say little here.  Let it suffice to note, that in all probability there were many Jews with Datis and Artaphernes at Marathon in 490 b. c. and with Mardonius at Plataea in 479 b. c. and that prisoners there taken by the Greeks may well have formed the first real contact between Jew and Greek. True it is, that slavery had previously brought many of the Children of Israel to the Grecian States. For, even in pre-exilic days the Prophet Joel had reproached Tyre and Sidon  as follows: "And the children of Juda, and the children of Jerusalem you have sold to the children of the Greeks, that you might remove them far off from their own country."  But these struggling exiles may be disregarded as they left no abiding influence, as far as we know, on their environments. In fact, Max Radin, in connection with the Greeks and Romans, assumes it as a first principle, that "Jews of to-day are lineal descendants of the community organized by Ezra,"  and consequently post-exilic. </p><p> As regards Rome, Philo is explicit,  that the d C Rome Jewish community there had its origin in released prisoners of war.  And the relation of Jew and Gentile in the national stories of Greece and Rome is altogether too extensive to be noticed here even in summary. Those who are interested will find the detailed account of Radin well worth their perusal.  </p><p> refers to a region scarcely touched yet by research, but evidently containing remains of a considerable civilization. A few parallels to Egyptian subjects should be noted. The contracted burials are seated, as the Peruvian, not recumbent; usually a 'killed' bowl with a hole knocked in the bottom is placed over the head.  This custom is explained thus : 'Ceremonially every piece of pottery is supposed by the Hopi (tribe) to be a living being, and when placed in the grave of the owner, it was broken or killed to let the spirit escape to join the spirit of the dead in its future home/ As we have no record of the Egyptian motive for 'killing* pottery, furniture, etc., any clear statement like this is of value. Some animal figures are much like the prehistoric Egyptian hippopotami. Hooked sticks, like those in the tomb painting in Hierakonpolis, LXXVI, are shown as carried by hunters; and parallels are given for such being throwing sticks used in hunting. Later they became sacred emblems among the Hopi. These similarities may serve to explain Egyptian usages, without any suggestion of actual derivation. </p><p>  After all this, it must be apparent how ill-judged it is to stress too much similarities in manners and customs between two peoples widely separated by time and dis tance. With a certain amount of sceptical reserve then, we may now approach the study of the Jews in Africa. Nevertheless, it would be a great mistake at the very outset, to look anywhere for a clearly defined ethnic group.  The present chapter shows that in their Dispersion, the Jews not only ceased to be a homogeneous people, but partly by absorption where their numbers were comparatively small, and partly by proselytism where they constituted an appreciable element in the community, they have tended in the course of centuries, to build up an entirely new Ethnic Complex, or rather a widely scattered series of Ethnic Complexes, all differing one from another, and one and all essentially divergent in race and language from what they are pleased to regard as their parent-stock, the family of Abraham. And yet they are still in their own estimation, as well as in the regard of the world, the Children of Israel. </p><p> After showing that there is no such thing as a Jewish race, Professor Pittard makes the comment : "It is possible that, in all large communities there exist a certain number of individuals representing the genuine original Jew who is probably the Assyroid dolichocephalic type.  But in the central and east European countries (Germany, Austria and Russia) this type appears to be in a minority. Maybe as a group, the Spaniols represent it better than other groups."  </p><p> Cephalic indices then, will aid us little in our African quest, and that tenacity to the religious traditions, that so long characterized the Jew of the Ghetto, has too frequently yielded before the enervating influence of prosperity on the one hand, and the devitalizing tendency of Mohammedanism on the other. </p><p> Yet, there remains that mysterious something Constitutes deep ingrained in his very being, that effectively the Jew? segregates the Jew from the rest of humanity, if not racially, at least socially. For, while strictly speaking, the Jews are not a race but "a social and religious community," as we have seen,  still in everyday life, when even the religious element has been eliminated, the renegade must still be classified as a Jew and nothing else. As a consequence, although a Jew may be a perfect gentleman in every way, endowed with wealth, and a man of education and refinement, the fact that he is a Jew is ever uppermost in the minds of men, and too often, the high esteem that is his due, is tempered by disgraceful prejudice. Nay more, if in time he comes to neglect the Sabbath rest and ignores the fasts of precept; if he utterly disregards all dietary restrictions, and openly scoffs at the Law and the Prophets; if, finally, he casts all religion aside and becomes an avowed atheist or Bolshevist — in a word, if he proves himself faithless to the most sacred traditions of his religion and his people — it makes no difference in the eyes of the world, he is still a Jew ; and according to the consensus of public opinion, nothing he can do will make him less a Jew. </p><p> Let him, on the other hand, go so far as to become a Christian, it matters not. Among the Christians themselves he must now be pointed out as a convert- Jew. And the term, let it be understood, is not used in any derogatory sense, or as implying the slightest opprobium. Christ was a Jew! The nucleus of the Church was Jews ! And his fellow Christians, for the most part, hold him in high esteem precisely for his antecedents and the sacrifices that his conversion must have entailed. Yet even in their eyes he has not ceased entirely to be a Jew. </p><p> What then, practically constitutes the Jew?  It is not race, the Jews form not a race. Racially they are as complex as many of our best Americans. It is not place of birth. No more is it a question of language. Neither, finally, is it any longer a matter of religion. What is it then? I do not mean technically, but in the broad acceptation of the word — what really differentiates the Jew from other men ? The minimum requirement would seem to be a descent through at least one line of ancestors from one of the sons of Jacob, or from some individual who in the past was incorporated into the body of Jews so as to imbibe their spirit and adopt their practices. In our quest then, for the Jews in Africa, this must be the criterion of our judgment. </p><p> </p><p>
