<p>Despite the scandal in The Forum, the Knopfs had kept their confidence in Larsen and were expecting a book from her in due time. Blanche asked her to come into the offices on the fifth of March “to meet an African savage,” as Larsen facetiously put it.  The occasion was actually a party for new Knopf author, Bata Kindai Amgoza Ibn Lobagola, of Benin (supposedly), and a number of Knopf authors and literary lighst attended—James Weldon Johnson, Van Vechten, H.L. Mencken, Henry Seidel Canby, and Dashiell Hammett among them.   The guest of honor, a onetime vaudeville entertainer now making a living as a “lecturer” on African customs, had published some memoirs in Scribner’s in 1929, and the Knopfs were bringing out a book-length version with the sensational title Lobagola: An African Savage’s Own Story. This was clearly an attempt to cash in on the current interest in exotic customs in places untouched by the hand of Europe. The publishers made much of Lobagola’s being a ‘savage’ from a part of Africa supposedly never visited by whites, although Lobagola described himself as a ‘Black Jew’ descended from people who had left the Holy Land after the destruction of Herod’s Temple and wandered across the Sahara to the rain forests of Benin. In truth, he was born Joseph Howard Lee in Baltimore, and had latched on to the African-prince persona as a career move. The book was picaresque pseudo-autobiography, almost unedited, bristling with the author’s social-anthropological observations about ‘West African’ customs and his cross-cultural adventures in Africa, Europe, and the United States. Few reviewers were fooled, however, and it seems unlikely that Larsen or her friends were. The anthropologist Melville Herskovits would give a scathing review of the book in The Nation that Larsen almost certainly saw in late July, by which time Lobagola was under indictment for sodomy with a fifteen-year-old boy in the Bronx, a member of one of his enthralled high school audiences.</p>
