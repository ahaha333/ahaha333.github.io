<p> </p><p> Forging the Dark Continent: An African Savage’s Own Story</p><p> </p><p> An intriguing example of the kind of intra-racial and cross-cultural passing/masquerade being discussed can be found in the life and work of a man who, at the same time as Garvey’s Prince Kojo, made quite a career for himself as a Dahomeyan prince. In this case ethnic altercasting is linked clearly to both vaudeville and ethnographic display; and "philological assimilation" is turned back to not Africa but a commodified performance of its absence. Prince Bata Kindai Amgoza Ibn LoBagola was the author of An African Savage’s Own Story, an autobiography first published in Scribner’s magazine in 1929 and in book form soon thereafter. We have David Killingray and Willie Henderson to thank for unearthing and unmasking LoBagola, since his book was forgotten after having been widely dismissed and discredited upon its publication. In its time the "autobiography" was compared to Rene Maran’s Batouala (1921), the first black novel to win the French Prix Goncourt. However, the narrative, style, and language have more in common with Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan of the Apes than with Batouala or even Equiano’s Travels. Knopf, LoBagola’s eventual publisher, already had success publishing the work of Walter White, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, and Carl Van Vechten; so the presence of this racial "forgery" in the midst of a literary renaissance obsessed with racial and cultural authenticity is too good to be true.</p><p> LoBagola’s story is an essential text of its time because it shows just how much intra-racial masquerade occurred not only on the margins of the "great race welding" that was the Harlem Renaissance but also in the shadows of the undifferentiating gaze of white ethnography. Like Bert Williams, LoBagola provides the link between "ethnological show business"—the display of "foreign peoples for commercial and/or educational purposes"—and a heteroglot pan-African politics and sensibility. Such impersonation is undertaken in relationship to the "spectatorial apparatus," as Bill Brown would have it, that "incitement to visibility and a protection from contact" which "makes visible the need to make the black man and the blackness of the black man visible." It is the stress on race as a visual form of knowing that is exploited here as a mode of strategic disappearance. To become an "African" was in some ways a partial escape from race by asserting a cultural specificity and authenticity that may or may not have been one’s own. However, to call oneself a "prince" was also to ennoble that site of racial/cultural origins and, in both cases, to blind white spectatorship and its desire for visual fidelity. In other words, one could pass in the other direction and in such a way that one would disappear into a fictional authenticity and operate cannily from within it.</p><p> An African Savage’s Own Story strangely parallels Equiano’s Travels and Batouala. It begins with an exotic West African setting—one that was both imaginary and produced by an untrained ethnographic vision. The first few sections are rich with folk tales, strange customs, and details of social life, and the final chapters are curious compendiums of ethnographic material. In the first section, "A Savage Home in the Ondo Bush," Ibn LoBagola tells us that he was born "in the village of Nodaghusah, six hundred miles north of Abomey Calavi, once the capital of Dahomey, and about forty-five days’ walk north of the Gulf of Guinea, and three days’ walk south of the native city Timbuktu. The country is in the Sudan, in the sphere of influence of the French Colonial Government." According to his telling, the term "Dahomey" does not come from the natives of that savage bush, although it is in the local vernacular. "Dahomey" as a name for this space between bushes arises from his particular subculture: the "B’nai Ephraim," or as called by the natives, the "Emo-YoQuaim." His people are the "strange people," the "Black Jews of the Ondo Bush" who arrived in the land of "Da-Ome" (Good Water) almost two millennia earlier. It should be noted that Equiano, in his Travels, on a number of occasions liken the natives of his Africa to Jews. Ibn LoBagola writes:</p><p> How this name left our present country and drifted to the coast, I have never found out, but Dahomey is the name of the country on the coast. It did not take long, according to our rabbis, for the natives on the east and west of us to find our snug little place. They surrounded us and wrested from us the village that our people had made, and set up their own rule. We were never a fighting people, and we were easily subjugated. But we lived on in that same place, and we have seen many changes, but we have remained always the same, preserving our law and guarding our sacred Torah with our very lives.</p><p> Traveling to Africa after the destruction of the Temple in Judea, the "strange people" migrated to Morocco only to leave after encountering even greater persecution. From there they migrated to Timbuktu, where they "were not treated badly, but we were not content to live under the rule of desert tribes any longer than was necessary." After so many of them died from impure water, they decided to stay in a "bush" that had good water despite being surrounded by "wild beasts, elephants, leopards, lions, monkeys, and reptiles, the horned viper and the boa constrictor, and thousands upon thousands of hook lizards. This was the place we decided to make our home, because we were free when we came upon it." This depiction of LoBagola’s "bush" is in marked and spectacular contrast to Equiano’s highly romanticized description of the "charming fruitful vale" of Essaka.≠ Ibn LoBagola, unfortunately, says nothing about the evolving and mutating racial character of this migrant people; he says nothing about their skin color and what happens to it as they travel for so long and for so far and for generations engage and encounter radically distinct cultural and ethnic groups. He tells nothing of the politics of passing as survival/subterfuge, which is nothing new to the Jewish Diaspora, although he does claim that "purity in blood" is the root of their nobility.∞ What is important here is that this description of his authentic identity, which he maintained throughout his life even up until his famous conversion to Roman Catholicism, establishes Ibn LoBagola’s ethnography as being produced already by dislocation, from a marginalized, migrant not-quite African perspective there in the heart of savagery. Despite his attempt to cloak himself in an authenticity that was eventually revealed as false, it is important to note that this "African-ness" in his own telling is ultimately not "African" at all.</p><p> It is obvious that these earlier sections of An African Savage’s Own Story borrowed heavily from the numerous travel narratives and popularized adventure tales of the time in which the African background is rendered as pure fantasy. Where Equiano spends much of his time attempting to rationalize and demystify "primitive" Africa, Ibn LoBagola seems to often revel in its savagery to emphasize his own personal narrative of transcendence in the context of a general civilizing. Because these earlier and contemporary adventure tales were about dark and mysterious Africa, even the most outlandish representations could be accepted as authentic, or at least believable. "Africa" stood for literary fantasy, for an utter fiction of romance, exploration, and escape—in short, as a landscape it was always already a literary forgery that contained and helped to control the administration and domination of "the real." No two writers express this better than H. Rider Haggard in England and Edgar Rice Burroughs in America. In terms of cultural impact and iconic influence, their respective "Africas" have been much more significant than those of Sir Richard Burton, John Speke, or even Joseph Conrad’s favorite, E. D. Morel, and LoBagola’s favorite, David Livingston.</p><p> One could easily read Burroughs’s Tarzan of the Apes series as not just the extension of a Haggardian vision but the American appropriation of that colonial envisioning of Africa to signal a discursive if not formal colonial control as one empire succeeds the other. The "Africans" in Tarzan of the Apes—many of whom are literally lynched in this novel after Tarzan learns how to use a lasso—are very clearly African Americans who, now free, are depicted as reverting to wildness and savagery. Ibn LoBagola’s Dahomey borrows heavily from the traditions of colonial travel narratives and colonial adventure fiction, just as his performance of African identity borrowed heavily from the science of ethnography and the art of popular fiction. To his credit there is a good amount of ethnographic detail and quasi-anthropological investigation in the autobiography along with the very obvious elements of adventure melodrama. But the words "savage" and "horrible" appear far too often in this narrative for it to be anything more than pulp fiction; moreover, there are just too many titillating and overexaggerated descriptions simply to impress the 1920s audience.</p><p> Ibn LoBagola’s racial politics, however, is clearly at work in those sections in which he observes that the native traditions and local cultures are far superior to those he would later encounter in the West. For example, after comparing African polygamy with Western monogamy, he concludes, "one wife with divorce and alimony is not so wholesome as twenty wives with neither divorce or alimony. The wild men in my country do not know anything about alimony; it seems to me, alimony is making a lot of civilised men wild." Also, "You could not blame me for the habit of telling the truth; I was on the way to becoming civilised, but I was not yet quite civilised enough to tell lies." One is reminded here of one of Du Bois’s darkest statements in The Souls of Black Folk, where double-consciousness is linked directly to double-dealing: "The Price of Culture is a lie." There are many such observations in LoBagola’s narrative, though they are perhaps less moralistic than the ones that proliferate throughout the anti-slavery polemic of Equiano’s Travels. Another such moment of relativism comes when he describes how white men were seen and imagined in the Ondo bush, in a passage similar to Equiano’s description of the European slavers who he is initially convinced are cannibals. Ibn LoBagola writes:</p><p> "As for me, I never saw a white man in my country. When I was a child, as far back as I can remember, and that must be when I was about four years old, I heard talk of white people, but it was never clear whether white people actually lived, or whether they had become extinct. I welcomed the thought that they had died out. All I could hear my mother say was that if white men should come across us, they would eat us raw. She said they fed themselves only twice in the year, and that then they ate their young if they could not get the young of other people. My mother said that white people came like witches, from no one knew where; they just appeared and disappeared. They were formed much differently from our own men; every white man had only one of everything: one eye, in the middle of the forehead, one leg, with a great wide foot, fan-shaped, so that when he lay down, the foot acted as a sunshade. A white man had no visible nose, and his mouth was large and could be made much larger at will. He lived on raw human flesh and could be seen in the bush just before and just after the rainy season."</p><p> Obviously Ibn LoBagola is very much aware of the politics of myth and fantasy and how much myth and fantasy came to bear on the white colonial view of Africa and Africans. Africa as a site of fantasy, darkness, a continent of monsters is here overturned in a relativistic gesture where the European reader encounters himself through the eyes of an authentic savage—or, a black persona masquerading as an authentic African savage who uses that masquerade as a strategic, critical position. Just to make it clear that he is quite aware of this gesture and of his reversal of the tropes and topoi of colonial narratives of African monstrosity, LoBagola writes:</p><p> Now, what could you expect us children to see, when our parents told us such things? Especially when they were supported in their stories by men who had been accustomed to going away to different trading markets? Some of these men had seen white men, but they knew nothing about them. That is reasonable, because I know even in these Western countries, where everyone is supposed to be wise, some provincial folk know that wild black people exist, and many have seen them, but they do not know much about them. I venture to say that they talk to their children in no uncertain terms of "niggers," as the black men are called here.</p><p> This politicized pseudoethnography must be situated in relationship to LoBagola’s own description of his work as an "itinerant entertainer and vaudeville artiste, informant to anthropologists, lecturer on African ‘culture,’ convict, and soldier in both the United States and Britain." His perspective and its political impact are produced by a life in which race is encountered and experienced in multiple ways and in a panoramic social landscape that few African Americans of his time and generation could have had access to. Not only was he a native informant; on his way to West Africa he actually described himself as an anthropologist as well as a "British Colonial Subject." Later on in his narrative he would confess, "To tell the truth, I had no idea what I was saying . . . So I followed instructions and simply played to the gallery." Talk about plural masking and double voiced signifyin(g): Ibn LoBagola was an even more multiple mask-in-motion than Bert Williams and used the mask to make much more noise, escaping perhaps much deeper into the strategic fiction of African identity.</p><p> Bert Williams’s only experience in Dahomey was onstage. Although it is not described in his "autobiography," LoBagola did spend some time in West Africa. He told the Naturalization Service in 1934, "I went to London and was there several months and went to Dahomey, West Africa. I stayed there and traveled in the bush north of Dahomey until 1912, when I returned to Scotland in May, 1912." The autobiography states that he was advised to emphasize for his audiences that he was not from any specific part of Africa but from "Dahomey" simply because in the world of vaudeville, as in the world of minstrel theater, it was a well-known topos : "people would not believe me if they did not know where the place was. I got thorough instructions."∞ In tracing LoBagola’s life, Killingray and Henderson write that he "followed the path of many traveling ‘Africans,’ to be found performing and struggling in every corner of the world, and at times being ‘studied’ and exhibited as creatures of exotic, and often imaginary, cultures." He was an example of how a "purveyor of ethnographic data and popular entertainment blended into one." For Ibn LoBagola scientific knowledge of race and vaudeville performance were no different from each other. To be a cultural informant was literally to be a performer. To be a native was to be onstage; to be an African was to wear (multiple) masks. To lie was to entertain, but given Ibn LoBagola’s constant critiques of racism, colonialism, and white supremacy, it was also to return the white ethnographic gaze by opting to only seem like its product in order to safely gaze back. As Curtis M. Hinsley writes in his study of the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, "Where the gaze can be returned, specular commerce becomes uneasy."</p><p> In line with this relation between ethnography and intra-racial masquerade, Shane Peacock explores the display of Zulus by P. T. Barnum and others during the late 1800s after the Anglo-Zulu wars in Southern Africa. This sets the stage for LoBagola and for Bert Williams and George Walker, who in 1894 would do exactly the same thing as the notorious "African Savage" and take on the personae of exhibition Zulus years before becoming successful on the vaudeville stage. Peacock writes, "it was not uncommon for Victorian promoters to exhibit ‘exotic Africans’ who were really from places like Hoboken or the Bronx." His wonderful essay "Africa Meets the Great Farini" tells the story of an African American from North Carolina who was over seven feet tall. After approaching a museum in circa 1882, he was remade into a "Dahomeyan Giant" by a theatrical costumer and coached to forget his ability to speak or understand the English language. This masquerade was so successful that he was then passed on to a sideshow where for many seasons he "posed as a Dahomey giant, a Maori from New Zealand, an Australian aborigine and a Kaffir. This man’s success was the initiative for a score of other Negroes, who posed as representatives of any foreign races the sideshow proprietor wished to exhibit." Bert Williams’s own penchant for playing other kinds of nonwhite ethnicities in his minstrel performances is very much a part of this much larger tendency in American sideshows (and perhaps cultural discourse) to collapse all forms of subordinate otherness into one.</p><p> LoBagola’s masquerade is thus merely a part of a long tradition of both black-on-black minstrelsy and a commercial form of ethnic altercasting. Black performers participated in this form of racial commodification simply because the white market for extreme racial and cultural difference was lucrative in an era in which those spaces and people once located as "exotic" and "distant" to the white imagination were becoming dangerously banal and easily accessible. Not only were these performances a sign of American imperial provenance; they represented a colonial consumer malaise at the root of American "produce imperialism." It was the white gaze that was being exploited by these commercial displays, a gaze so overdetermined and conclusive in its knowledge of otherness that it was simply begging and paying to be deceived. For example, when "The Great Farini" premiered his "Friendly Zulus" in England before bringing them to America, he did so at a theater well known for blackface shows and minstrel vaudeville—the site of racial fraud and impersonation. At the end of his long career displaying exotics, The Great Farini took charge of England’s widely popular Moore and Burgess Minstrels. During this period, the line between blackface and the display of "real" Africans was therefore porous and fluctuating, maintained by the increasingly ill-fitting garb of race and exploited by the pseudo-coherence of the category which maintained itself in two primary ways: by the overwhelming desire for it to fit and by the frisson produced by the possibilities of deception.</p><p> By the time of Ibn LoBagola’s stint in England there were already many African-themed or black shows in popular theater, where the legacy and memory of the Williams and Walker troupe was still very much alive. According to Killingray and Henderson, In Dahomey had become the name of a popular troupe and LoBagola did perform on the vaudeville stage as "The Fire King of Dahomey." An African Savage’s Own Story describes Ibn LoBagola’s first encounter with "other" blacks as a spectator at a French colonial exhibition:</p><p> During the whole time that I had lived in Scotland and in England, I had never seen another black man. I remembered seeing blacks from Dahomey on exhibition in the Dahomey village in Paris when my young master had run away with me; but before then, and since then up to the time that I am speaking of, no one had ever mentioned to me that there were black people living in the world outside my own land, Africa.</p><p> Although this confessional autobiography is largely a fiction, it is important to note that the transatlantic encounter of black intra-racial, cross-cultural differences is here mediated by colonial exhibitions. It is curious that this fact is conveyed a mere page after LoBagola writes of his entrance, however innocent, into the world of ethnographic show business and racial display/ performance while in England:</p><p> In New Brighton I met a woman, a Mrs. Collins, who traveled in a show. She owned a traveling cinematograph show and induced me to go with her to attract people to see her show. I did not see why I should not do as she asked and, in fact, I thought it would be fine sport; so I went along. Her people taught me how to dance, and then they dressed me up in a white suit and made me dance on a platform outside the show. By traveling with the show I saw many towns in England.</p><p> But it is in America that he supposedly becomes much more dependent on that form of performance for his living. It is in America that ethnographic show business makes him famous as performer and ultimately as a lecturer on the university circuit—a distinct form of vaudeville: "I secured many engagements on the vaudeville stage. My picture appeared in a motion-picture weekly and I was heralded far and wide as ‘The Fire-proof Man.’ A vaudeville circuit gave me bookings through theatres all over the eastern part of the United States, and it seemed as if my star were in the ascendant."∞ LoBagola claims to have danced and performed in an early silent film and to have become the darling of the media; he went from performance to performance shifting his stories and his costumes to suit the crowd and their interests. From America to Europe to Africa to vaudeville to the University of Pennsylvania; from the department of anthropology at Oxford to dressing in feathers, playing with fire, and landing in prison; from accusations of fraud to multiple charges of pedophilia and child molestation: this was the trajectory. And he never removed the mask.</p><p> It is during this period working in America that he claims to have first encountered racism: "Now I was confronted for the first time in my life with the problem of colour. Up to that time no one had ever mentioned my blackness to me; it had not been thought of, so far as I knew, except as a curiosity. The thing that puzzled me now was that I was not spoken of in the new country as a black man; I was called a ‘coloured’ man." He avows that he went to America partly out of an eagerness to "help civilise the people there." But his first encounter with the problem of color? What does it mean for this African American performer, wearing a complex ethnofictional African mask, to tell us that it is in America that he first encountered racism and the color line? And this especially after he has described his relationship with his "master" as a young boy in Scotland, seemingly without irony: "We loved each other, just as a master loves his pet dog, and the dog loves the master." This statement comes in the chapter entitled "Taming Begins," in which LoBagola perversely romanticizes the process by which he is transformed from a jungle "monkey" into a semi-civilized Scottish lad. When as a young boy he returned to the Ondo bush from Scotland he was scolded by his native father for his affection for his "white father" and his confusion about his racial persona: "Don’t you know that you cannot be white and black at the same time?"</p><p> The text is full of such race and color tensions, far in advance of LoBagola’s fictional landfall in segregation-era America. An awareness of American race-relations in fact suffuses the text and informs and motivates its sometimes powerful and oftentimes bizarre take on early-twentieth-century racism and colonialism. It seems clear that the narrative ultimately saves its ire for the racism of Ibn LoBagola’s "authentic" home, for America: this was the place where he was most scarred by not only racism but also relentless allegations about his sexuality and his inappropriate relationships with underage white boys. Early in the narrative he exclaims, "I love my native country, I love my savage people; but at the same time I am forced to hate my own customs, the customs of my father. I am neither white nor black, I am a misfit in a white mans country, and a stranger to my own land." Which native country? Which savage people? What kind of stranger? What customs? What kind of misfit? Here the levels of doubling, alienation, and marginalization seem far too extensive to be contained without some form of ruthless and relentless masking. Some form of intra-racial passing is absolutely necessary as a tortured psyche folds in upon its own fictions.</p><p> Like Equiano and Prince Kogo, LoBagola was hounded by accusations of his inauthenticity, accusations that his story was a fraud and his specialist’s knowledge of Africa purely fiction. Not that it mattered much to the exhibitors and those who engaged him for lectures; many of them knew that to an audience hungry for the exotic, the mask was as good as flesh, provided it was costumed, painted, and situated in an ersatz natural (or authorial academic) setting. Not that it mattered much to LoBagola, who at times seemed much less interested in racial or cultural fidelity than were his contemporaries in the Harlem Renaissance. Yet LoBagola, like Equiano and Prince Kojo, protested vociferously, knowing that in an intensely racist climate the mask was much safer than flesh and allowed much more freedom: "People all over the country try to show that I am deceiving people in this story of my life. They have told me to my face that I never saw Africa; that I was born somewhere in western Pennsylvania or in some place in the South."</p><p> The introduction to An African Savage’s Own Story echoes the controversies surrounding Equiano’s Travels as encountered in Caretta’s edition. It also reminds one of Ras Makonnen’s description of the subversive politics of the "fez": "Ibn LoBagola’s costume is usually the costume of any well-dressed American, but on occasion he wears a red fez and sometimes a loose robe, neither one of which, he says frankly, has anything whatever to do with his native land . . . he wears fez and robe merely for effect." After all, says the</p><p> introduction, here reminiscent of the various descriptions of Bert Williams, "He is a born mimic and delights in entertaining." The introduction asks, "Is the Story True?," primarily for reasons of the disbelief that attended Ibn LoBagola and the publication of An African Savage’s Own Story. This disbelief derived in part from the racism of the time, which was still unsure about the literary ability of blacks—especially untutored blacks from a ferocious and savage bush. And that is precisely what Ibn LoBagola exploited: that racist disbelief, which, though still rooted in ethnic pseudoscience, was nevertheless hungry for that science to entertain:</p><p> From a scientific point of view, attention is attracted to this African savage’s life story for two reasons: his unequalled presentation of authentic African folk-lore and tribal customs; and the remarkable development, psychologically, of a naked bushman into a man of ability in civilization. That a naked bushman should develop into an author is certainly remarkable; it is a long step from being an unclad savage in the Ondo bush to being a professional writer.≠</p><p> To make his case and respond to his critics, the African savage, like Equiano, provided "a great number of letters, recommendations, official records of military service, and photographs of himself at various ages and by giving the names and addresses of people who corroborate what he says."∞ Of course, these were all forgeries.</p><p> After unveiling Ibn LoBagola as Joseph Howard Lee, born in Baltimore in 1887, Killingray and Henderson suggest that for this poor African American to play "the alien African prince" enabled him to "thumb his nose at ‘Jim Crow’ laws." This is the same point made earlier by Ras Makonnen and Ralph Ellison; though for West Indians in an African American city and renaissance, passing as African Americans would be their way of thumbing their noses also at Afro-Yankee parochialism while simultaneously maintaining their own problematic sense of cultural superiority. In this way African otherness enabled one to maintain pride of culture while simultaneously accepting the anti–African American racism of the time and the attendant logic of white supremacy. The "uneasiness" that Curtis Hinsley describes in relation to "specular commerce" is an uneasiness with regard to the specular racial categorization upon which both racism and African American nationalisms depend. It is a dis-ease akin to the "category crisis" that Marjorie Garber describes in the politics of drag and cross-gender performance because it fragments the racial category and its supposed political affiliations along cultural, linguistic, and national lines. It is more complex here, however, because the poles of difference in Garber’s theorizing—male and female—begin from the assumption of essential difference. This category crisis is rooted in a fundamentally assumed sameness: African and Negro.</p><p> Killingray and Henderson conclude their "outing" of LoBagola by locating a politics in this masquerade, one vastly different from that allowed by Afrocentric or even pan-African appropriations of African identity, which almost always imply a transnational if not essentialist solidarity:</p><p> By adopting an African identity LoBagola was able to exploit his blackness in a way that opened doors that would otherwise have been closed to an African American. In the process he was able to fool a whole range of professional people in the white establishment. Undoubtedly he was exploited, but he also exploited others by his talent for imitation and presentation. As such he entertained at a high standard before large, appreciative, and sometimes critical audiences.</p><p> LoBagola’s African persona, while both flawed and frequently challenged, was successfully maintained . . . his African "mask" represents an imaginative flight, an escape into a fantasy world, lived out as real. His attempt to justify his own deep-seated confusions and inner tensions by claiming to be a "savage" outsider has pathetic appeal. In one powerful image he can gather together the various fragments of his life in a way which both asserts his dignity and shifts the blame: a fractured and disturbed life made coherent, but not healed, by an appeal to an African identity. . . . LoBagola’s autobiography well illustrates his ability to entertain and to charm, as well as to manipulate.</p><p> . . . LoBagola played the African prince, a fire-eater, a savage bewildered by modernization, the clown, and much else, but he could also turn his hand to the straight act as singer, Scottish comic, or if necessary, the urbane and disciplined speaker who entranced high school students and well-heeled members of smart bourgeois clubs and confraternities. . . . For an African American to do this consistently in his own country while pretending to be an African says a great deal about his talent. LoBagola did come up against racial hostility and abuse, but he met this by boldly maintaining his stage life and by claiming that he was an African and not a black American.</p><p> The description of all of the personae that LoBagola/Lee had at his disposal only emphasizes how much of a strategy ethnic altercasting was for this man for whom racial performance was life. Bert Williams at least tried to maintain a difference between the personae on and off the stage. Indeed, he went so far as to publicly acknowledge that even the name Bert Williams was a fiction:</p><p> "Nobody in America knows my real name and, if I can prevent it, nobody ever will. That was the only promise I made to my father." Eric Ledell Smith guesses that this reticence might have involved a family secret. However, Marjorie Garber notes in Vested Interests that historical records reveal that it was almost a common practice for cross-dressers to conceal their "true" identities up until their deaths and beyond. What this suggests is that the secret of Bert Williams’s persona was more than just the fact of his masked West Indian identity and suppressed vernacular. The absence of a real name was a statement of control over his history and identity in a culture where he rose to stardom but was never ever quite at home; where he achieved success via a persona that he could profit by but which was not his own. The absence of the name—the concealment of the name—functions to keep alive the fracture between race and culture, his distance from the African American community alongside his commitment to a more abstract racial uplift. To be nameless is to keep the masks in play far beyond his era, his generation, and his time on stage: it is to control his own invisibility and to stage his own disappearance.</p><p> LoBagola, on the other hand, can be named, identified, and psychoanalyzed. What can be discovered in the story of Joseph Lee is a politics of racial inauthenticity, one of masquerade in which the knowledge of how hegemonic racial categorization works allowed this strategy of self-erasure, of disappearance through and as performance. In other words, like so many others before him and so many others who worked in the interstices between vaudeville and "ethnological show business," Joseph Lee was a minstrel, but one who worked outside of the bichromatism that had come to define the form. As such, he and the countless others who wore the African mask for a variety of purposes showed how global the impact of that American cultural form was and how far blacks from all over the world could go in implementing it for strategic purposes in the shadow of race. Lee, however, was not interested in the moment of contrast enabled and emphasized by the ritual of "wiping off," or in this case revealing the culture beneath the race. That he could follow the trajectory of the Jewish minstrels in their strategic use of blackface to attain a form of social whiteness was impossible, as it was for Bert Williams. LoBagola was trapped because the only thing close to whiteness was in keeping the mask on, in hiding the "ordinary nigger" behind the performance of regal African identity and allowing the tropes of exotica to free him of the restrictions placed on African Americans. Defending his "stage life" while offstage was a way of extending the performance, expanding it so that its norms and conceits could be employed to supersede the extreme social and political limitations of the "real" world.</p><p>
