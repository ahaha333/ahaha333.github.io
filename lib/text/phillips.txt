INTRODUCTION </p><p> </p><p> A librarian is accustomed to all sorts of questions, but let the builders of courses in world-fellowship come to the library, then indeed he ransacks his shelves and his brain. Where can he find the answer to such a question as, What Chinese has benefited all humanity by sacrifice of himself ? Or, Who are some of the men and women of the Orient who have risen from obscurity to positions of leadership? When he does find the needed names, where can he find the material to personalize them? We rely upon the writers of such courses to be true to facts and to make correct interpretations. They need facts, then, for the foundation, and for the background they need color and atmosphere. These books are created for all grades in the church school, and they reflect the life of all nations. They might appropriately be called "People from Everywhere." The popularity of the courses is as great as their variety and attractiveness. Yet more highly to be prized is their moral power. These books are a real factor in breaking down race prejudice. So many tragedies in the world because of race conflicts ! So much wrong because peoples of different races do not understand one another! </p><p> </p><p> "There lies the tragedy of our race: Not that men are poor ; All men know something of poverty. Not that men are wicked ; Who can claim to be good? Not that men are ignorant ; Who can boast that he is wise ? But that men are strangers." </p><p> </p><p> Race prejudice hides at the heart of international strife and lurks behind many an evil condition within nations. Every person casting an influence against it is a real benefactor. Greatly to be honored and helped are the authors of world-fellowship books. Where shall the makers of these courses find their illustrations and examples, their plots, their happenings from every-day life, the ideals of the people they are depicting, the real characters that will arouse admiration and stimulate interest in all races ? Books should be forthcoming at the demand of these workers and marshalled for their purpose; and of the many types of books needed, biography is of primary importance. </p><p> </p><p> Biography cannot be excelled for source material and for supplementary reading. It has strong personal appeal. Much of it has been written with great literary distinction and is of such absorbing interest that it rivals fiction in popularity. Very often it furnishes the best medium for interpreting the life of a people. Libraries are finding that modern biographies make fine sequels to missionary books of former days. Supplement the lives of pioneer missionaries with those of modern missionaries and with those of nationals of our own time, and the picture of any nation is far more complete and accurate than when only the pioneer missionary biography is used. Biographies that depict present-day life will often attract where those of by-gone days fail. </p><p> </p><p> This book contains brief reviews of a number of biographical books representing races and countries that need to be better known. Such nations as France and Germany and Great Britain are not represented for the reason that we have had many and varied opportunities to become acquainted with their people. In some instances it has been necessary to omit a country because no biography of high literary quality could be found in English. This is regretted. </p><p> </p><p> From some sources, notably from Africa, China, India and Russia, there is a great outpouring of excellent literature available in English. At this rate we will soon be reading biography from every land. The choice of books has been determined by (i) reliability as to facts; (2) their emphasis upon matters of real importance; (3) their contribution ta a sympathetic understanding of lands and peoples as well as their delineation of the lives of individuals; (4) their literary style and capacity to hold interest. </p><p> </p><p> If some old "stand-bys" are missing from the list, it is because they have not met these requirements. It has seemed wise to tell enough about each book and quote sufficiently to show its style and the character of its material. The list presents about a hundred biographies. They furnish a basis for acquaintance with twelve countries and bring new friendships with fifteen different races. It has been a delight to find so many biographies of nationals from the lands we want to know better. May each person who uses this book discover and add to its list many more biographies that help to form friendships across all barriers of race and nation.. May those who are working in the cause of world-fellowship find the bibliography practical and helpful. That is its purpose. </p><p> </p><p> G. D.

This is the fascinating story of a savage from the African bush where no white man has ever been. LoBagola has become civilized and here writes his own biography. It is a thrilling account of wild life and an interpretation of the savage mind. It is also the subtle history of racial amalgamation, for LoBagola is a black Jew. It is further a revelation of human development. From the little seven-year-old boy who landed in Scotland one bleak March, all in his primitive naked state, to the cultured writer and lecturer we see how civilizing is achieved and, more than that, we see what it does. The book is also a revelation of the drawbacks of civilization. The process brought him lies and deceit and robbery, gave him rum, brought him experience of unfaithfulness in marriage and showed him the frequent gulf between good manners and high principles. He says his people in the African bush practiced purity and truthfulness. His experiences are undoubtedly exaggerated, yet his reaction to our life and his difficulty in finding any place among us bring us to pause and remember our idealism. After all his varied experiences, it is quite a relief to find him saying : </p><p> </p><p> "Today, even after a quarter of a century afterwards, I honestly advise any boy in my own African home who wishes to leave for the purpose of seeing white men that the experience is worthwhile." </p><p> </p><p> This is a book which every missionary and every explorer should read before coming into contact with any savage people. It would do wonders in helping the civilized man to understand his uncivilized brother. And perhaps those of tis who are forever limited to civilization would be better for reading it. If we have any idealism left, it should quicken us to more ardent pursuit of the best life.
