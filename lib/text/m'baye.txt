Pan-Africanism in Olaudah Equiano’s Interesting Narrative</p><p>
</p><p> The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Written by Himself (1795) is the most celebrated autobiography of a black writer from the West. In The Classic Slave Narratives (1987), Henry Louis Gates Jr. canonizes it as “the prototype of the nineteenth-century slave narrative” (xiv). A decade later, Caryl Phillips describes it in Extravagant Strangers: A Literature of Belonging (1997) as “the first authentic account in English of the life of an African slave” (9). Adebayo William’s “Of Human Bondage and Literary Triumph: Hannah Crafts and the Morphology of the Slave Narrative” (2003) reestablishes the pivotal place of Equiano in black literature. Comparing Equiano’s narrative with those of Cugoano and Sancho, Williams says, “Of the three, Equiano was the most politically important and by far the most talented” (143).</p><p> More recently, Vincent Carretta depicts the book as being “motivated by a combination of factors,” including “a desire to recount his spiritual autobiography, and an interest in outlawing the African slave trade.”1 Carretta neglects the place of Equiano’s narrative in Pan-African history, however, since he believes that Equiano was not born in Africa.2 In Equiano The African: Biography of a Self-Made Man (2005), Carretta contends that Equiano “may have invented rather than reclaimed an African identity” and that he may have also “invented his African childhood and his much-quoted account of the Middle Passage on a slave ship” (xiv). Carretta further claims: “The accounts of Africa and the Middle Passage in The Interesting Narrative were constructed” (xiv). Carretta’s thesis was recently challenged by G. Ugo Nwokeji’s revelation that “Equiano’s baptism in January 1759, arranged by his owner and his relatives, happened more than three years after his slave name and purported Carolina birthplace had appeared on record for the first time through the handiwork of his naval officer master, Michael Henry Paschal” (Review of Equiano the African, 840). Therefore, Equiano’s possible birthplace in England is less relevant than the African origin and identity that he presents in his narrative since, as Nwokeji posits, “Essentially, the choice is between Equiano’s own claim and documents his master was instrumental in creating” (840–41). While Equiano’s life in the diaspora reveals certain ruptures from his homeland and his inventions of new identities in the West, there is no conclusive evidence that he was completely disconnected, alienated, or deracinated from Africa.</p><p> Olaudah Equiano played pivotal roles in the Pan-Africanist tradition of resistance against Western stereotyping and economic exploitation of blacks. Expressing ambivalent positions toward Africa and the West, he fulfills the complex and double functions that trickster figures in Igbo folklore perform as mediators between individuals and ancestors and as negotiators for the people’s acquisition of agency and power. Although it is replete with dualities that are visible in how the author positions himself between Africa and the West, Equiano’s narrative is distinctively Pan-Africanist. Equiano’s memoir reflects both the radical ideas of resistance of black intellectuals of his generation and the humanitarian concepts of freedom of abolitionists of his time.
According to his autobiography, Equiano was born in 1745 in Essaka, an Igbo agricultural province located in present-day southeastern Nigeria.3 One day in 1756, when his parents had gone to the farms, two persons came to their home and kidnapped Equiano and his sister. Six months later, he was taken to Barbados, from where he was sold to many slave traders who made him work as a seaman in England, the British Caribbean, and the United States.4 In 1757, Michael Henry Pascal, a British navy lieutenant, purchased Equiano from Mr. Campbell, in Virginia, and took him to the West Indies and to England (60). Pascal named him Gustavus Vassa, after a sixteenth-century Swedish patriot. With Pascal, Equiano traveled to the Americas, Turkey, and the Mediterranean and participated in the renowned Seven Years’ War.</p><p> When he was not at sea, Equiano spent most of his time reading, writing, and learning arithmetic. In 1762, Pascal refused to set him free and sold him into West Indian slavery. In 1766, Equiano, who had become a very skilled sailor, soldier, and trader, bought his freedom from a Quaker called Robert King, and began to work for the abolition of the slave trade.5 In the last part of his life, he traveled to England, North America, continental Europe, the Middle East, and Central America, and went on an adventurous expedition to find a northeast passage to the North Pole.6 He then returned to England to convert to evangelical Christianity and work for the British government’s effort to abolish slavery.</p><p> In order to understand the influence of Igbo folklore in Equiano’s work, one should study the author’s biography and the relationships between his Igbo culture and the former English colony of Virginia where he spent a part of his life. Virginia, like South Carolina, was a settlement where Igbo populations from Africa brought pervasive Africanisms during the Atlantic slave trade. In Equiano The African, Carretta posits: “As a slave brought from the hinterland Biafra, he [Equiano] would most likely have been brought to the port of Bonny on the Bight of Biafra” (30). As Gomez points out in Exchanging Our Country Marks (1998), “the Bight of Biafra, the Igbo’s region of origin, accounted for nearly one-quarter of the total number of Africans imported into North America, placing it in a virtual first-place tie with West Central Africa” (114–15). According to Carretta, the ship Ogden that left the coast of Biafra and sailed for Barbados in March 1754 was the schooner that carried Equiano to the New World (African, 30–31). As Carretta suggests, the sloop Nancy brought Equiano to the York River in Virginia on June 13, 1754, two weeks after Equiano arrived in Barbados (37). Virginia was then a colony in which Igbo culture and people were more predominant than those from other parts of Africa. In a similar vein, Douglas Chambers points out in Murder at Montpellier: Igbo Africans in Virginia (2005) that the “Igbo presence in eighteenth-century Virginia was pervasive, especially in the interior Tidewater and Piedmont counties on the upper reaches of the James, York, and Rappahannock Rivers” (13).</p><p> The high proportion of Igbo culture in Virginia is also evident in Exchanging Our Country Marks, in which Gomez argues that, during the middle of the eighteenth century, the Chesapeake was “the preserve of the Igbo” even if the Akans of the Gold Coast and the Senegambians accounted for a substantial part of this settlement’s population.7 In this sense, Igbo folklore in colonial America was a creolized culture because it coexisted with the traditions of the Akans, the Senegambians, and other Africans. In Generations of Captivity: A History of African-American Slaves (2003), Ira Berlin writes: “Although the presence—and rumored presence—of slaves from Africa provided a connection to an African homeland, too few Africans entered the interior to reafricanize the slave population. The vast majority of immigrants were African Americans, drawn from all over the North American continent” (170). Although he underscores the mixing of African traditions in North American slave cultures, Berlin seems to deny the consistency that existed in these cultures. While they borrowed folklore and worldviews from one another, Africans who invented these slave cultures preserved their particular ethnic characteristics that allowed them to develop a distinct black diasporic identity. Responding to Berlin’s thesis, Chambers argues that even if Africans from other ethnic backgrounds were in Virginia in the mid-eighteenth century and continued to arrive in the 1760s and early 1770s, “the historical world the creolizing slaves created in Virginia seems to have developed largely from a diasporic Igbo base. By drawing on their ancestral material, social, ideological, and other resources to adapt to slavery and make sense of their new lives, communities of Igboized Creole slaves created a distinctive culture informed by ‘Eboe’ or Igboesque principles and paraphernalia” (11). Therefore, the Igbo diasporic legacy in Virginia and other parts of the United States was consistent despite its hybridity. Moreover, as Chambers suggests in his essay “Tracing the Igbo into the African Diaspora” (2000), in order to understand the continental Igbo heritage in the New World, one needs “to follow Eboan African (Igbo) peoples and history from the hinterland into the diaspora” (58). It is from this viewpoint that I examine the survival of Igbo folklore in the New World as oral tradition that Equiano and other early Igbo migrants brought with themselves. In order to trace this folklore from Africa to the diaspora, one must examine its survival in modern Igbo culture in order to be able to trace its roots in early black Atlantic traditions.</p><p> The influence of Igbo folklore in the New World is noticeable in the stories of captivity and resistance that the descendants of the Igbo in both the black diaspora and Africa tell in an attempt to understand the plight of their ancestors. In The Igbo Roots of Olaudah Equiano: An Anthropological Approach (1989), Catherine Obianuju Acholonu uses oral history as a means for retracing the origins of Equiano and collect numerous stories about the black writer’s enslavement in Africa. Acholonu conducted numerous interviews with descendants of Equiano that suggest the importance of storytelling in Igbo culture. In one of the interviews, Igwe Agbaka tells Acholonu the following narrative that explains the origin of the Igbo people’s belief in the “Big God in the Sky”:
There is a people called the Aros of Arochukwu. In the olden days, as we were told, these Arochukwu people used to come. They were associated with the Igwe k’ala (Igwe ka ala, which means ‘Sky supersedes the Earth’) of Umunneoha, an oracle, situated some forty or so miles away from Isseke. The Igwe (Sky) people from Umunneoha used to bring those Arochukwu people. In our land, if a person was considered a misfit or a trouble-maker and was to be sold, we would invite the Arochukwu people. They would take the person away and our people would say that Chukwu (the Big God in the Sky) had eaten him. This is the God we knew about before this recent Christianity. (74)</p><p> The Igbo religious mythology is a commentary on social and economic relationships that engendered the alienation or enslavement of numerous mem bers of Igbo society during the Atlantic slave trade. The historical importance of the Igbo spiritual legend is evident in the narrator’s representation of the other world where the “trouble-makers” were taken as the land of Chukwu, suggesting the Igbo’s ability to use their religion as a means for appeasing the trauma that enslavement created in their community. Even if it does not appear in the above text, the enslavement of these Igbo was the result of a collaboration between European slave traders and some local Igbo individuals who influenced the Arochukwu to sell their neighbors to them. This partnership is apparent in the following story that Acholonu has collected from her interview with Ambrose:
Apart from the fact that the Aro people came here to kidnap people, there was a woman who lived in the neighborhood who was noted for her long basket with which she carried away children and sold them to the Aros. Her name was Ucheime Nwankwo. She always carried a large basket (ab􏰃). She was a native of Arochukwu who came to live among us. And she was a kind of contact person for the slave-traders in the place. From Arochukwu the slaves were sold to Azumili—the riverain area between Cross River and Arochukwu and Bende districts. (48)</p><p> This story reveals the Aro’s involvement in a type of slavery that was prevalent in Equiano’s homeland during the time when he was kidnapped in Africa. The references to the woman who carries children away in baskets and the contact person of slave traders are preludes to the story of Igbo enslavement into the diaspora. These allusions implicitly criticize the Aro’s involvement in a slave commerce that Europeans instigated. As Gomez suggests in Exchanging our Country Marks, in the middle of the seventeenth century, the Aro responded to the tremendous demand of slaves in the Biafra by raiding and kidnapping other subgroups in exchange for European textiles, manufactures, firearms, tobacco, alcohol, and ornaments (132–33). Because of this trade, the Aro transformed the sacred Igbo land of the “Big God in the Sky” into a passage into slavery in the West. As Gomez remarks, “The Oracle of Arochukwu ‘became an instrument of exploitation among the Igbo’ in that the autochthonous system of justice was altered in order to advance slaving interests” (133).</p><p> Furthermore, Igbo oral tradition represents differences of social class and plight among Igbo people during the Atlantic slave trade, epitomizing the connection between religious myth and economic materialism. In Murder at Montpelier: Igbo Africans in Virginia, Chambers argues that the people of Elem Kalibari, Nigeria, have oral traditions in which they say that “Bonny stole the Europeans from them. They describe the conflict in terms of struggle in spiritland between the tutelary gods of each group” (30). This oral history reveals the economic decline and loss of power that slavery brought among the inhabitants of Igboland. Chambers’s representation of “spiritland” as a contested terrain for diverse Igbo spiritual entities suggests the power that homeland would later have on the transplanted Africans as a signifier for a lost diasporic identity they wanted to recuperate. In Caliban’s Reason: Introducing AfroCaribbean Philosophy (2000), Paget Henry represents oral narratives as stories that “atavistic cultures have consistently created to intuit and transform a creation of the world into a myth,” affirm “the focus of their collective existence” (23), and “confirm their identity and their rights to the land they occupied” (24). This affirmation of right to homeland and origins is evident in the oral stories that the descendants of the Igbo people have created in the diaspora to understand their past. The oral tradition is evident in Julie Dash’s book Daughters of the Dust (1997), adapted from a film of the same title. This narrative describes how a group of Igbo African slaves walked in the sea to go back home when they arrived in the United States and realized the dire fate that awaited them there. The character Paymore suggests that the Igbo were displeased with the harsh treatment of white slaveowners:</p><p> Dey put de Ibo men to work in de fields, but it no good. Dey lay down an not get up even when dey beat half to death. It like dey want to die, and dey help demselves to it. Dey put dem to all kinds of work, but dey no good for nuttin. Dey set de Ibo women to work in de yard, and it not much better. De other captives mad wit dem cause when de Boss Man mad wit dey, it bad for everbody. Paymore him tell de Boss Man dey fair builders, an de Boss Man put dem to work carryin de wood for de new landing. . . .
When de Boss Man say dey finished, de Ibo start wailin an carryin on. Cryin so dat de birds in de trees stop de callin, de animals in de woods run for cover, all de work stop cause de cryin hurt so bad. (104)</p><p> Physical, psychological, and emotional suffering thus prompted the Igbo to resist the subversion of their white owners by deliberately refusing to perform the tasks they were assigned to do. The dire plight of the Igbo in the diaspora is apparent in the image of slaves who are “wailin and carryin on” and “cryin so dat de birds in de trees stop de callin, de animals in de woods run for cover” (104). Paymore’s reference to animal and vegetable beings reflects his attempt to appease the pain of his Igbo ancestors. The fact that the Igbo workers continued their chores despite the agony of enslavement contradicts the way in which the scholarly literature depicts them as people of weak constitution. In Equiano, the African, Carretta traces this stereotypical portrayal of the “melancholy reflections,” “depression of spirits,” and “constitutional timidity” of the Igbo to Bryan Edwards’s The History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies, written in 1793 (32). The evidence in Daughters of the Dust shows that Edwards was wrong to view the Igbo as weak people. These Igbo walk away from the brutality of their masters and disappear in the sea not as an act of “suicide” but as a defiance of the authority of white slave owners. Giving an example of Igbo resistance against their white oppressors, Paymore says:</p><p> Dey stop dey cryin all de sudden. Everting stay quiet! All de Ibo start to walk to down de landing headed to dey home. De Boss Man try to stop dey, but dey walk right through he! Das what Paymore say! Dey go through he like dey a summer breeze. Him holler for de others to come help he, but de other captives can see de Ibo walk right in he front an come out he back. Dey aint messin wit dat! Oh, no! Dey step off de landing an start to walk cross de water, head for home. De other captives run to see the Ibo walk de water. Dey walkin all right! Caint nobody say dey aint walkin de water. De Boss Man hair turn white as cotton when him see dem walk de water. Now dey get aways out, an de other captives dey run to follow dem, but when dey step off de landin dey fall in de water. Dey pull some of de captives from de water, but some just gone like dat! Everbody watch dem Ibos cross de water til dey couldn’t see dem no more. (104–5)</p><p> Paymore’s story reflects the strong spirit of resistance against slavery and its tyrannies that the Igbo slaves in America developed against their white oppressors.8 These Igbo preferred death to a continuation of life in misery, humiliation, and deprivation, showing a great sense of honor and moral and physical strength. In the same vein, they demonstrated a great spirit of solidarity that is visible in the collective way in which they planned and implemented their spiritual return home. The Igbo’s spiritual return home resonates with the sacred effort that Dash and her African American community make by remembering the history of their black ancestors who had been forcefully brought to the diaspora. As Sheila Smith McKoy points out, Dash attempts to preserve the knowledge of some semblance of home, or “the knowledge of what could be the mast of the slave ship that brought his [Eli’s] ancestors to Daughter Island” (“Limbo Contest,” 220). The survival of Igbo folklore in the United States is also apparent in When Roots Die: Endangered Traditions on the Sea Islands (1987) in which Patricia Jones-Jackson identifies correspondence between the Igbo tale “Nnabe and the Fruits” and the Sea Island narrative “Ber Rabbit, Ber Wolf, and the Butter” (113). According to Jones-Jackson, the similarity between these stories is visible in the manner in which “Nnabe is able to defraud a whole host of animals” while “Brer Rabbit outwits Brer Wolf” (113). Later, Jones-Jackson identifies another parallel between Igbo and American tales:
The spider, tortoise, and hare are shown to be inferior to and answerable only to a higher immortal being, Chineke in Igbo and the Lord in Sea Island tales. Here, for example, Nnabe and Ber Rabbit seek more knowledge from their creator in “Nnabe and Chineke” and “Ber Rabbit and the Lord.” While both animals are revered for their wit and ingenuity, both are kicked out of heaven when they attempt to cheat God. Both continue to bear the scars of God’s wrath: Nnabe has a broken shell as a result of his fall, and Ber Rabbit has a white tail as a reminder that God threw a cup of milk at him as he was ejected. (113)</p><p> Here I provide similar analyses of the relationships between African and New World folktales by interpreting their influences in Equiano’s narrative, revealing parallels in the ways in which Equiano and Pan-African trickster characters resist oppression and achieve liberation.</p><p> Equiano’s Interesting Narrative played key roles in the development of Pan-Africanism. On the one hand, it takes part in the black diaspora’s cultural and intellectual reconnection with Africa by showing how an enslaved African reconstructs his ancestral African traditions and worldviews from the New World. On the other hand, the story belongs in the black diaspora’s political and economic denunciation of slavery and imperialism. Understanding the diverse contributions of Equiano’s narrative in Pan-Africanism requires a change of the lenses through which it is interpreted. This alteration requires an African-centered approach that removes the narrative from the reductive epistemologies through which Western critics tend to analyze it. This decentering necessitates an African criticism that interprets black literature in its African context. In Belated Modernity and Aesthetic Culture: Inventing National Literature (1991), Gregory Jusdanis writes: “An African criticism will situate works in the traditions of its African audience and illuminate the social and philosophical conditions that the works address. The only alternative is for Africans to develop discourses that are as embedded in their own ‘plot of his tory and mythology’ as European theories are defined by European perspectives” (10).</p><p> First, Equiano’s narrative is a recollection of the Igbo culture from which slavery had severed him. His memory of this culture is noticeable in his depiction of the social, political, economic, and cultural characteristics of life in his village. He writes: “When our people go out to till their land, they not only go in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a surprise; and when they apprehend an invasion, they guard the avenues to their dwellings, by driving sticks into the ground, which are so sharp at one end as to pierce the foot, and are generally dipt in poison” (39–40). The villagers’ willingness to give up their own lives to protect their territory reflects the paramount importance that the Igbo give to their land.9 By forming a group and taking their weapons to defend their land, Equiano’s African community reveals the Igbo sense of communal identity in which the preservation of a shared territory was perceived as the expression of an extended sense of kinship between the inhabitants of the society. As U. D. Anyanwu argues, the Igbo perceive communal spirit or solidarity as the “union of living blood relatives, the dead relatives and the gods of the community—a sort of spiritual commonwealth” (“Gender Question,” 31) that the term Erima describes (34). This spiritualistic view of communal identity is the root of the sense of togetherness and determination that Equiano’s people demonstrate in their protection of their land.</p><p> Equiano’s narrative is also a study of the effects of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa. Describing insecurities that the trade brought into the Igbo community and the corruption it created in their society by influencing the local inhabitants to become involved in the sale of human beings, Equiano writes: “From what I can recollect of these battles, they appear to have been irruptions of one little state or district on the other, to obtain prisoners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by those traders who brought European goods I mentioned, amongst us. Such a mode of obtaining slaves in Africa is common; and I believe more are procured this way, and by kidnapping, than any other” (40). Equiano’s views show the manner in which slaves in Igboland and in other parts of Africa were obtained during wars and kidnappings. His opinions reflect a harsh and complex dynamic of enslavement that must be placed in its proper historical context before it is misunderstood as simply an evidence of Africans’ enslavement of Africans in traditional Igbo society. The Igbo practiced slavery. But their system of servitude was not as brutal as the one that the enslaved Africans experienced in the West. First, slavery in Igbo society was not the racialized and hegemonic system of domination that was particular to the Western world. Instead of being an economic system based on the torture of members of one racial group, slavery in Igbo society was a burden that fell indiscriminately on any people who allegedly failed to protect their patrilineal and matrilineal lineages. Victor C. Uchendu says: “As they [the Igbo] conceive their statuses, a slave was a man whose links with his lineage had been severed forever” (“Igbo of Southeast Nigeria,” 88). In this sense, slavery in Igbo society was rationalized as the effect of personal disconnections from ancestral lines, and not as the result of racial inferiority.
Another peculiarity of the Igbo servitude system was that it allowed slaves to gain social, political, and economic advancement. Regarding the conditions of the Igbo called Osu (also spelled as Ohu), Daniel A. Offiong says that these slaves were allowed to achieve upward mobility through marriage with members of noncasted groups (“Status of Slaves,” 32–33).10 According to Offiong, the Igbo also permitted the Osu to become “judges, lawyers, beauty queens, academicians and magistrates” (50). Uchendu describes this process of upward mobility in Igbo society as “absorption,” that is, the manner in which the slaves became the companions of their masters into whose lineage they were generally absorbed (88). In this sense, the Igbo did not view the Osu as people who inherited a permanent low status.</p><p> The literature on slavery in Igbo society shows a massive increase of this slavery that resulted from frequent wars and conflicts between ethnic groups that were fueled by the presence of Europeans in search of slaves. As a consequence of this European influence, many Igbo became victims of slave raids and were captured for sale to Europeans. As Gomez shows in Exchanging our Country Marks, by the 1670s, the cities of Bonny and Elem Kalabari had become major suppliers of captives to Europeans (132). According to Gomez, this trade led to the enslavement of nearly one million people from the Bight of Biafra, most of whom were caught in the area of Arochuku, where a powerful “Oracle” resided (133). These numbers show the devastation that the Atlantic trade created on an Igbo society in which slavery was part of social relations based on African principles of trust, communal bonds, and individual achievements rather than on the war and violence that Europeans instigated in Africa.</p><p> Moreover, Equiano’s narrative is a study of the community, culture, and family from which he came. He tells us that his birthplace is “one of the most remote and fertile” provinces of the kingdom of Benin, then situated in current Nigeria (34). He depicts Essaka as a region where there is strong individual freedom and collective social and economic responsibility. He admires the high social and judicial status his father had for being an Embrenche, a term “importing the highest distinction, and signifying in our language a mark of grandeur” (34). Validating the practice of scarification, common in many parts of Africa, he relishes the fact that he was expected to receive a mark from the top of his forehead down to his eyebrow, just as judges and one of his brothers had already borne (34).</p><p> Yet, reflecting ambivalence about Africa, he exhibits double consciousness toward his Ibo culture by recollecting an instance when “a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and delivered over, as the custom was, to her husband, to be punished. Accordingly he [the husband] determined to put her to death; but it being found, just before her execution, that she had an infant at her breast, and no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse, she was spared on account of the child” (35). Though the Embrenches’ leadership fascinates him, Equiano is outraged by their arbitrary use of the law. While he is impressed with the fact that they spared the life of a nursing woman who had committed adultery, he is put off by their punishment of the women’s adultery with slavery or death while the men are allowed to “indulge in a plurality” of sexual relationships without necessarily facing any penalties (35).</p><p> Moreover, he criticizes the corruption of customary law that supported the practice of slavery in Africa. He writes: “I remember a man was brought before my father, and the other judges, for kidnapping a boy; and, although he was the son of a chief or senator, he was condemned to make recompense by a man or a woman slave” (35). Here, Equiano is uncertain as to whether he should condemn the African practice of domestic slavery or not. Being reluctant to condemn this slavery system for fear that his white readers would use it to justify their participation in the Atlantic trade, he tactfully makes an implicit censure of African slavery without likening it with its brutal counterparts in the Americas.</p><p> Equiano’s censure of African forms of servitude is further noticeable when, referring to Richard (Dick) Baker, who was one of his white friends and shipmates, he states: “From what I could understand by him of this God, and in seeing these white people did not sell one another as we did, I was much pleased; and in this I thought they were much happier than we Africans” (63). This passage contradicts Equiano’s early argument that the African form of slavery was less traumatic than its Western counterpart (37). He says that people from Essaka occasionally sold slaves who were mainly prisoners of war or people who had been convicted of kidnapping, adultery, or other crimes (38). Yet he points out that these slaves received better treatment than they did in the Americas (40–41). He compares the Igbo system of slavery with that of the Caribbean, in which slaves did constant hard work, ate and were fed differently than were their owners, and had no “slaves under them as their own property, and for their own use. (41)</p><p> Furthermore, Equiano indicates the difference between slavery in Igboland and that in the West by portraying the terrible experiences he had in Virginia and on the West Indian Island of Montserrat, where he was a slave. He remembers his experience in Virginia as a “dreadful review to my mind,” which “displayed nothing but misery, stripes, and chains” (89). Resonating the Africans’ preference of death over shame, he asserts: “I called upon God’s thunder, and his avenging power, to direct the stroke of death to me, rather than permit me to become a slave, and be sold from lord to lord” (89).</p><p> In the same vein, he recalls the terrible experiences of slaves on the Island of Montserrat, where Captain Doran sold him to Robert King (90–91). Although he represents King as an owner who was initially kind to him and who fed his slaves properly, Equiano describes the masters on the Island as generally violent toward their slaves (90–91). Identifying with the suffering of these slaves, he depicts the predicament of “a countryman of mine who once did not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and, though he brought it the same day to his master, yet he was staked to the ground for his pretended negligence, and was just going to receive a hundred lashes, but for a gentleman who begged him off with fifty” (91). Equiano continues: “This poor man was very industrious; and by his frugality, had saved so much money by working on ship-board, that he had got a white man to buy him a boat, unknown to his master” (91–92). Thus, Equiano abhorred the degrading conditions in which slaves were kept in the West.</p><p> Despite his denunciation of slavery, Equiano was engaged in this institution at some point in his life. His involvement in the slave trade began at the time when he belonged to Mr. King, who employed him in “supplying the place of a clerk,” “receiving and delivering cargoes” to ships, “tending stores,” and “delivering goods” (92–93). As Jennifer Margulis notes in her review of James Walvin’s biography of Equiano, his participation in slavery suggests a major contradiction in his resistance to this institution, because it allowed him to profit from the trade that he abhorred (175). Yet, Equiano’s involvement in slavery was not a self-defeating enterprise since it allowed him to obtain the knowledge that he needed to have in order to acquire his freedom and help other Africans. While it included transporting and selling slaves, Equiano’s role as a trader taught him important business-keeping and moneymaking skills that an entrepreneur like himself needed to have in order to succeed in the capitalistic economy of the Atlantic world in which slavery was a major part. Discussing Equiano’s relationships with this economy, Lynn M. Festa observes in Sentimental Figures of Empire in Eighteenth-Century Britain and France (2006) that Equiano is “a self-made man in the more colloquial sense of the expression: in his business transactions. The kind of reversal permitted by the acquisition of literacy—the reflexive construction of self as subject and object—reappears in Equiano’s doubling of self as slave and trader. Equiano as a slave is a form of merchandise, but he incorporates himself into the system as an agent, trading goods in voyages that included transporting slaves” (143). On the one hand, Equiano uses his “double” status of slave and trader as a means for garnering ideological and material strength that can liberate him from slavery. As Houston Baker points out in Blues, Ideology and AfroAmerican Literature (1984), “the pure product of trade,” Equiano “becomes a trader, turning from spiritual meditations to canny speculations on the increase of a well acquired and husbanded store” (35).</p><p> On the other hand, Equiano uses his position of trader as a means of assimilating into the institution of slavery and gathering daunting facts on its inhumane treatment of Africans. Describing the Europeans’ appaling treatment of Africans in the ships that were bound to the West Indies, he writes: “While I was thus employed by my master [Mr. King], I was often a witness to cruelties of every kind, which were exercised on my unhappy fellow slaves. I used frequently to have different cargoes of new Negroes in my care for sale; and it was almost a constant practice with our clerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the chastity of the female slaves; and these I was, though with reluctance, obliged to submit to at all times, being unable to help them” (93). Equiano’s description of the “violent depredations” of white clerks on the “chastity of the female slaves” suggests his continuous abhorrence of the brutal trade in which Mr. King had compelled him to be a merchant. In an attempt to compensate for his involuntary and debilitating role as a trader, he uses this status as a tool for developing secret connections with other enslaved Africans to whom he shows “diligence” and “care” (94). This strategy helps him to dissuade Mr. King from selling him to other traders and to develop a tacit solidarity with Africans.</p><p> Furthermore, Equiano’s involvement in slavery enabled him to resist the capitalistic commodification of Africans as properties. Vilifying the ways in which the capitalistic economy of slavery exploited the labor of Africans to the benefit of a wealthy class of white merchants and antiabolitionists, he observes: “I have known many slaves whose masters would not take a thousand pounds current for them. But surely this assertion refutes itself; for, if it be true, why do the planters and merchants pay such a price for slaves? And, above all, why do those who make this assertion exclaim the most loudly against the abolition of the slave trade? So much are men blinded, and to such inconsistent arguments are they driven by mistaken interest!” (93). Equiano’s rationale suggests his ability to use his insider knowledge of the barbarity of the slave trade as a basis for promoting the development of a new and fair labor system that safeguards the African workers’ right to provide voluntary and paid “service” to others (93).
Equiano would have been unable to understand capitalism if he had not been a slave trader. Being a merchant helped him to infiltrate the economy of slavery in an attempt to replace it with an equitable and entrepreneurial system in which free service, not forced labor, is the basic means of exchange of products. Equiano’s alternative to capitalist economy of slavery is apparent in Ross J. Pudaloff’s argument that “despite his own enslavement, Equiano celebrates commerce and exchange because they make the self a product of exchange. He gains his freedom by purchasing himself and implies that the exchange of money for self can lead to a new and better identity” (501). This “new and better identity” is antithetical to slavery’s commodification and alienation of Africans, since it stresses the primacy of independence and entrepreneurship that Equiano invoked as a means of conveying a subtle Pan-Africanist message of liberation from oppression.</p><p> Moreover, being a slave trader allowed Equiano to travel to many continents and gain a cosmopolitan knowledge of the world. According to Leyla Keough, “Even after he bought his freedom in 1766, Equiano elected to remain at sea for several years. He voyaged to the Arctic as a surgeon’s assistant and to the Mediterranean as a gentleman’s valet, and for a time lived among the Moskito Indians of Nicaragua” (“Equiano,” 684). When he was free, Equiano continued to work as a slave trader in an attempt to make some economic profit and be more familiar with the world. In February 1768, he hired himself to Dr. Charles Irving of Palmall, England, who paid him a low wage of twelve pounds a year (140). As James Arthur argues, between 1773 and 1777, Equiano joined Charles Irving again to “help [him] set up a plantation in Central America. He [Equiano] purchased slaves for the plantation and acted as an overseer. Eventually he returned to London” (“Slave, Subject and Citizen,” 154).</p><p> Although it included selling human beings, Equiano’s voluntary employment as a traveling slave trader helped him to develop a cosmopolitan knowledge of the world. This cosmopolitanism is apparent when he says: “We sailed from England in July following, and our voyage was extremely pleasant. We went to Villa Franca, Nice, and Leghorn; and in all these places I was charmed with the richness and beauty of the countries, and struck with the elegant buildings with which they abound” (141). Equiano’s travels exposed him to many cultures and gave him reasons to stay alive and fight for the liberation of his fellow Africans who deserved to have the same opportunities of freedom and mobility that he had. “Equiano,” as Christopher Apap points out, was then “an enlightened, cosmopolitan, and staunchly abolitionist African” (6). Equiano’s cosmopolitanism was a form of Pan-Africanism, since it aimed to inspire the Western world to treat Africans and other peoples as equals. As Christine Levecq argues in “Sentiment and cosmopolitanism in Olaudah Equiano’s Narrative” (2008), “in the representation of his relationship to Africa, Equiano sought to establish more equalized and less exploitative international relations” (13).</p><p> Yet Equiano naively believed that there was such a thing as a “kind master.” This myth delayed his subversive resistance against slavery and his destruction of his mirage of the illusive power of the white man. This transformation was latent because Equiano continued to romanticize whiteness and believe in superstitions that his white owners had embedded in his mind for a long time. Early in the book, white traders made him believe that they were going to take the other African slaves and him to a land where they were going to eat them (57). Also, he once believed that the picture he saw in a room of a slaveowner “was something relative to magic” (60). The two examples show how Equiano was a victim of the slaveholders’ use of superstition as a means for instilling fear among slaves in order to exploit them further. During this period, Equiano suffered from the same conditions that Betsy Erkkila describes in “Ethnicity, Literary Theory, and the Grounds of Resistance” (1995) as situations in which he became a silenced property of his kidnappers (576). According to Erkkila, in Africa “Equiano is kidnapped from his people and his country, transformed into goods, and transported and sold as property. This forced seizure from family, people, home, and land is accompanied by an act of literal silencing by his ‘kidnappers’ ” (576). Equiano’s belief in the existence of a “kind master” and his mirage of the power of whiteness exemplify a similar silencing of his humanity by slave owners.</p><p> Another example of the impact of the white man’s superstition on Equiano is when he describes Europeans as superior to Africans. Recalling the first three years he spent in England with Pascal, his owner, Equiano states: “I could now speak English tolerably well, and I perfectly understood everything that was said. I not only felt myself quite easy with these new countrymen, but relished their society and manners. I no longer looked upon them as spirits, but as men superior to us; and therefore I had the stronger desire to resemble them, to imbibe their spirit, and imitate their manners” (72). Equiano’s use of a trickster strategy allows him to assume a low status while implicitly fighting to reach a higher one. Appropriating the trickster tactics of Mbe, the Tortoise, he puts on a mask as an indirect means for struggling against oppression. As Wilfred Samuel argues in “Disguised Voice in the Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African” (1985), Equiano creates “a self whose muted voice veils covert intentions that lie hidden behind the façade—the mask, with which he disguises himself” (65). Equiano’s use of the mask as a means of resistance resonates with Igbo cosmology in which this object is the main tool that the exiled person who has been away from “the seven seas” into “the land of the dead” can use to preserve connections with “the land of the living” from which he/she came and with ancestors.12 The mask is Equiano’s tool for acquiring incremental power in English society without having his Igbo identity crushed by whites. By speaking the language of the English, absorbing their spirit, and imitating their lifestyle, he puts on a mask that helps him copy acceptable social behaviors in the West while remembering and preserving the ancestral heritage from which whites were trying to sever him. In this sense, he was a trickster who successfully assimilated into the world of whites in order to seek ways to free blacks from their oppression.</p><p> Putting on the mask is an initial stage where Equiano pretends to adopt some of the ideologies of the hegemony in order to gain strength in an environment where integration into mainstream society and appropriation of knowledge and power are strategic tools of resistance. His appropriation of power would have been impossible if he had not rejected the myth of the superiority of whites over blacks. His strength and self-awareness evolve out of the brutal wars in which he saw white soldiers become vulnerable like him. In the summer of 1757, Captain Michael Henry Pascal, who had just been appointed as first lieutenant of his Majesty’s ship the Roebuck, bought Equiano from Virginia and took him to many parts of the world, where he fought for England and learned many things (64). At that time, Equiano was twelve years old and described himself as being “at a great loss” and filled with “an endless field of inquiries” about most of the things that immigrants ask when they first come to the snowy parts of the West (63–64). He is graciously told that the white mass covering the earth is called snow, not salt; that the amazing voices he hears in a church is a worship of God; that the demeanor of the slender English women in the streets of Falmouth might not invoke the immodesty or the shame-ridden conscience of the Igbo woman (63–64). Listening to his American friend Dick Baker, who interprets English culture for him, he develops a thirst for discovering the books where whites preserve their knowledge. He writes: “I had often seen my master and Dick employed in reading; and I had a great curiosity to talk to the books as I thought they did, and so to learn how all things had a beginning. For that purpose I have often taken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it, when alone, in hopes it would answer me; and I have been very much concerned when I found it remained silent” (64).</p><p> In the passage, Equiano interprets the Bible as a book that contains images of a Saint ( Jesus Christ) whose benevolence and sacrifices are similar to those of African deities. Being aware of the importance of books in his subversion of the power of whites, he Africanizes the Bible, reflecting the Igbo trickster’s use of spirituality as a means for achieving freedom and power. While tricksters such as the Rabbit, the Dog, and Usu (the bat) appear in Igbo oral narratives, Mbe (the tortoise) is the master prankster in these folktales. Mbe epitomizes the African sense of resilience, adaptability, diplomacy, and refusal to be manipulated in challenging situation. Yet Mbe also exemplifies the individual’s capacity to be creative and able to absorb new knowledge in order to survive oppression. Characterizing Mbe, E. Nolue Emenanjo points out: “Down-toearth and as selfish as Mbe might be, and occasionally trapped to stew in his own juice, he always exploits his wisdom and the folly of his co-animals to wriggle out of the tightest corners. Mbe is rarely killed. The greatest punishment he gets is that he is thrown out of the company of the animals from above” (xvi). In this sense, Mbe epitomizes a fluidity of behaviors and identities that defies the good versus evil binary that characterizes the European concept of morality and order.</p><p> One example of Mbe’s resilience is the Igbo tale, “The Food Drum,” in which he lived in a society that used to be stable and peaceful until famine forced him to be exiled in a foreign land, where he established relationships with a spirit that provided him with the food and sustenance he needed in order to stay alive. The tale has two central episodes. The first one is the scene in which Mbe establishes connection with a providential spirit. The storyteller writes: “Suddenly, Mbe awoke and was terribly scared. He quickly drew his head inside his shell and waited for the worst to happen. The spirit, however, was friendly, and as the amazed Mbe looked on, he stretched out his thin hand and took one of the many drums hanging from the high roof of his house” (Okeke 31). The tale continues: “He [the spirit] hit one side of the drum, and Mbe’s favorite treat, bread-fruit meal, appeared! Mbe’s mouth watered, but he was cautious. Could this be a trick? he wondered. The spirit invited him to eat. Mbe could not resist. He fell to it as though it was his last meal, and ate and ate and ate” (31). Later, “he [the spirit] understood that Mbe must return to his family. As a farewell gift, the spirit presented Mbe with one of his drums, and also gave him lessons on how to use and keep it” (32). Mbe’s acquisition of the spirit’s drum is an allegory for the ways in which Equiano negotiates his relations with Christianity and the spirits within the Bible in order to gain the intellectual and spiritual power he needed in order to survive the famine of the “land of death” that slavery represented for the Igbo in bondage. Had he not Africanized the Christian god of his oppressors in the way Mbe had appropriated the power of the alien spirit, Equiano would have chosen death like most Igbo slaves did before or after they arrived in the West.13 Like Mbe, Equiano chooses life and receives the knowledge that allows him to return to the land of his ancestors without passing through death. By taking the Bible as his own, he domesticates its knowledge in the same way Mbe appropriates the Igbo spirit’s drum.</p><p> Brought into London by Pascal, Equiano and his American friend Dick Baker are conscripted into the British navy by force to fight for England (65). Equiano represents his enrollment as an experience that allows him to work as a human being equal to others. He asserts: “This was the first time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew what it was to have a bloody nose before” (65). This war experience allows Equiano to rid himself of his inferiority complex incrementally. After fighting in long battles against the French in 1759 around the area off Cape Logas in Portugal, he describes the atrocity of war that, paradoxically, helps him realize his equality to whites who, he initially believed, overcame death. He writes: “My station during the engagement was on the middle deck, where I was quartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermost gun; and here I was a witness of the dreadful fate of many of my companions, who, in the twinkling of an eye, were dashed into pieces, and launched into eternity. Happily I escaped unhurt, though the shot and splinters flew thick about me during the whole fight” (76–77). Therefore, war experience helps Equiano realize his equality to whites and allow him to confront Western prejudice, discrimination, and exploitation. On the moving ships where he is assigned to work, he counters the racism of European slaveowners with the spirit of tolerance and solidarity that he learns from life, books, church attendance, and his white friend Dick Baker. Describing the time when he is insulted in one of these ships, he writes: “Sometimes, he [Pascal] would say to me—the black people were not good to eat, and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country. I said, No; then he said he would kill Dick (as he always called him) first, and afterwards me” (62). Dick died, probably from hanging, during a battle that occurred before Equiano’s fleet moved to Gibraltar. Equiano describes how he found out about Dick’s death: “I learned from the boat’s crew that the dear youth was dead! and that they had brought his chest, and all his other things, to my master. These he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of my friend, whom I loved, and grieved for, as a brother” (73–74). By expressing sadness about the death of Dick, Equiano expresses humanism toward a fellow shipmate he admired as both a friend and a teacher who introduced him to Christianity and English culture. Recollecting Dick’s special qualities, Equiano writes: “I lost at once a kind interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at the age of fifteen, discovered a mind superior to prejudice; and who was not ashamed to notice, to associate with, and to be the friend and instructor of one who was ignorant, a stranger, of a different complexion, and a slave!” (61–62). As Robert J. Allison suggests in “Olaudah Equiano: An African in Slavery and Freedom” (1999), Dick was one of the Europeans, such as the Guerin sisters, who helped Equiano learn to read (about Christianity), write, and “feel more at home” in the New World (296).</p><p> The knowledge that Equiano gained from Africa, his personal experiences, and his white friends allowed him to begin a “marronage,” or a banding and bonding between slaves for survival and resistance against domination. Inspired by an interpretation of Alain L. Locke’s The New Negro (1925), Houston Baker defines the concept of “marronage” from a literary/philosophical perspective as a field of “national interests of a black community [set] in direct opposition to the general political and theological tenets of a racist land” (Modernism, 77).14 According to Baker, the work of “marronage” is, in itself, a communal project drawing on resources, talents, sounds, images, rhythms of a marooned society or nation existing on the frontiers or margins of all promise, profit, and modes of production (77).</p><p> Although it is often used to identify the Jamaican Maroons who resisted the British until the latter signed their independence treaty in 1739, the term “marronage” (also spelled as “maronnage”) is applicable to slave resistance in both the West Indies and the United States.15 The major characteristic of “marronage” is its covert, passive, and subversive forms of resistance. Parallels of these tactics are the strategies that James C. Scott describes in Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1985). Using the example of the South Asian peasantry’s subtle resistance against the dominance of their states and landowners, Scott identifies confrontation tactics that may pass unseen owing to their informal nature. A few examples of these subversive strategies that powerless groups utilize are “foot dragging, dissimulation, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, sabotage, and so forth.” These “weapons of the weak” help peasants to confront the exploitation they face (29–30).
In similar ways, slaves in the Americas used covert hidden transcripts such as the invisible bonding of kinship, intra-ethnic solidarity, and flight as subtle means of resistance against their masters.16 Discussing the liberation strategies of the African slaves in the Atlantic world, Chambers writes in Murder at Montpellier: Igbo Africans in Virginia: “Poison, arson, and running away were generic ‘weapons of the weak,’ and particularly effective ones for enslaved people resisting their oppression in a kind of asymmetric opposition to the hegemonic power of the masters expressed both individually as owners and collectively as the state itself” (13–14). Yet understanding “marronage” as a transnational resistance strategy that may not be physically implemented—as the use of arson or poison is—, helps us recognize the power of black literature as a subversive intellectual and ideological tool of resistance against oppression. From this perspective, Equiano’s discrete remarks, feelings, and actions are not accidents. They are conscious tactics of resistance against slavery. This resistance is blatant in a passage from Milton’s Paradise Lost that Equiano uses to describe the horrible things he saw on the ships in which he worked or fought:</p><p> Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can rarely dwell. Hope never comes That comes to all, but torture without end Still surges. (89)</p><p> Equiano’s use of the poem expresses his sadness and loneliness in a land corrupted by slavery that can be equated to the “land of death” in Igbo folklore. This world is a “no man’s land” of uncertainty and ambiguity that is devoid of life and spirit, where the survival of individuals depends on their ability to invoke and use the wisdom of the African pranksters. One example is Okolo, the hero of the Igbo tale “The Twin Gongs,” who finds himself in a “no man’s land” where tradition is the spiritual food that allows the individual to overcome the trauma of exile and violence. In this tale, a wicked chief is so jealous of Okolo, the leading wrestler of the village, that, upon hearing of his exploits such as the killing of a leopard, he decides to get rid of him (Okeke 23). As the narrator says, one day, the wicked chief orders Okolo to go to a smithy who lives in the “land of the dead” and bring back the famous twin gongs (23).</p><p> Having crossed seven stretches of grass-woodland, Okolo found himself in the borderland between the “land of the living” and the “land of the dead,” the latter being Agbano (the no-man-no-spirit’s land) (24). He quickly crossed the borderland and reached the land of the dead where everything was strange (24). The forced exile of Okolo is parallel to the enslavement of Equiano. Both exiles are allegories for the forced displacement of people from Africa into alien lands following drastic circumstances such as wars, famine, and disarray brought about by the Europeans’ presence on Africa’s coasts for slaves. These tragedies involved the responsibility of local African chiefs who often got rid of individuals in order to maximize profits from the commerce of slaves that Europeans were promoting and controlling.</p><p> As the narrator suggests, Okolo overcame the challenges he faced in “the land of the dead” by using the secrets that he learned during his journey. When he arrived in “the land of the dead,” Okolo found Uzummuo, a smithy who was a frightful but hospitable creature. Having been allowed to stay in the smithy’s room, Okolo realized that he was going to be burnt soon. When the smithy was asleep, Okolo “ran as fast as his legs could carry him,” passed Agbano, and reached “the land of the living” where “all the villagers rushed out to welcome him and dance to the music from the gong. Thus the envious chief was completely defeated!”</p><p> This narrative attests to Okolo’s ability to return to his lost community by taking advantage of the liminal space given to him in an alien and violent world. Equiano epitomized such heroic acts because he was able to take advantage of the negligible freedom of movement and association that his owners gave him in a fragmented world in order to fight for his autonomy and that of blacks on both sides of the Atlantic. Equiano never returned to Igboland physically. Yet he was spiritually and culturally connected with this homeland, since that is where his resistance strategies derived in Igbo folktales. He used this knowledge to protect himself from white violence, become educated, and achieve freedom in the West.</p><p> In order to understand how Equiano appropriates the Igbo trickster’s survival tactics, it is important to chart how he employs the weapons that were accessible to him in order to resist slavery. He condemns the moral and economic impact of slavery on blacks and the ill-treatment slaves experienced on Western ships: “I was made to help unload and load the ship. And, to comfort me in my distress in that time, two of the sailors robbed me of all my money, and ran away from the ship” (89). Later, he describes how he incrementally negotiates his freedom in difficult conditions. First, he rejects the language, myth, and ideas about supposed differences between blacks and whites. Second, he reconstructs his status by perceiving himself not as a slave but as a laborer who is forced to subsist in a racist, materialistic, and hierarchical society. When Captain Doran sells him to Mr. King, he negotiates the transaction with the Quaker and delights in working for a person who respects the fundamental role slaves played in the plantation economy. Equiano writes: “If any of his slaves behaved amiss he did not beat or use them ill, but parted with them. This made them afraid of disobliging him; and as he treated his slaves better than any other man on the island, so he was better and more faithfully served by them in return. By this kind treatment I did at last endeavor to compose myself; and with fortitude, though moneyless, determined to face whatever fate had decreed for me. Mr. King soon asked me what I could do; and at the same time said he did not mean to treat me as a common slave” (90).</p><p> Thus, Equiano perceives the plantation system as a business institution in which his survival depends on his ability to snatch an extent of freedom from the planter and expand it by his own efforts. This tactic recalls the strategic way in which Okolo survived in the “land of death” by avoiding the smithy’s wrath. As the storyteller tells us, when Uzummuo, the smithy, pretended to sleep, Okolo realized that he was being tricked and “Hid in a corner beside the door. Soon afterwards he was able to observe the Uzummuo roll over, and pull out his sword and strike at where Okolo was lying” (25). The moral of the story is that one should not be too comfortable with the hospitality of strangers. This parable is a metaphor for the ways in which Equiano could not rely on his owners, because he knew that they could sell him any time, as the Chief in the village had done to Okolo, or kill him, as the smithy tried to do to Okolo, if he became visibly subversive toward them. Knowing that his relationships with his owners were precarious and unpredictable, Equiano relied, as Okolo did, on his own wits.</p><p> In order to resist the subtle oppression of his owners, Equiano needed to appropriate the oratory skills of the Igbo trickster Tortoise, including the use of sweet-talking and indirections. These two devices are traceable to the Igbo verbal expression of implicit meaning that Dubem Okafor represents as a combination of “satire,” “irony,” and “a contradictory mode—[of] saying one thing and meaning another, praising and damning in one breath” (“‘Overdetermined,’” 92). The use of satire and irony in Equiano’s narrative is apparent in the trickster tactics he employs in order to criticize slavery even when he appeared not to be doing so. One example occurs when Equiano represents Mr. King as a person who sometimes considered slaves as workers who needed educational opportunities, decent pay, and care. He describes how Mr. King arranged for one of his clerks to teach him how to gauge (measure) after the latter told him that “I knew something of seamanship, and could shave and dress hair pretty well; and I could refine wines, which I had learned on shipboard, where I had often done it; and that I could write, and understood arithmetic tolerably well, as far as the Rule of Three” (90). By representing Mr. King in such glowing ways, Equiano was “singing the master” by appealing to his sense of paternalism and benevolence, which could be satisfied only through undeserved praises and thankfulness. In Singing the Master (1993), Roger D. Abrahams discusses how slaves in the Plantation South sang their masters through various activities such as chanting, dancing, and corn-shucking festivals, which emerged “as forms of active resistance, not in the sense that they attacked the system but rather in the ways in which they maintained alternative perspectives toward time, work, and status” (xix-xxii). The term “alternative perspectives” is essential in the theorizing of the master-slave relationships, because it shows that the slaves’ major goal in singing the master was to denounce the harsh conditions of their existence that the planter could not see because of his egotism and paternalism.</p><p> Developing “alternative perspectives,” Equiano denounces the injustices he faced when he worked as temporary cargo receiver and deliverer, clerk, and horseman without receiving any part of the hundred pounds he saved Mr. King each year (93). Connecting the injustice he experienced to the predicament of other slaves, Equiano says: “I have sometimes heard it asserted that a Negro cannot earn his master the first cost; but nothing can be further from the truth . . . I grant, indeed, that slaves are sometimes, by half-feeding, halfclothing, over-working, and stripes, reduced so low, that they are turned out as unfit for service, and left to perish in the woods, or expire on a dung-hill” (93). Equiano’s rationale counters Thomas Carlyle’s racist claim in The Nigger Question (1849) that slavery was beneficial to the enslaved Africans rather than to their European exploiters.19 Mr. King’s act of giving his slaves the opportunity to improve their skills was a way of increasing the slaves’ dependence on him rather than of making them be equal partners in the economy of slavery. Mr. King was then a trickster who gave slaves minimal freedom while expecting from them more labor in return. This subtle exploitation of slave labor was what motivated some planters to concede a degree of freedom to slaves in some quarters. In The Slave Community (1979), John Blassingame writes: “The planters generally had little concern about the recreational activities in the quarters. They did not, however, want their slaves carousing all over the country and wearing themselves out before the day’s labor commenced” (107). In this sense, planters conceded a limited and necessary degree of cultural freedom to slaves in order to maintain an indirect, patronizing, and hegemonic dominance over them.20 As is visible in the following Igbo folktale and Equiano’s narrative, authoritarian masters, such as Leopard and the planter, did not assign much value to the freedom of subordinate entities, such as slaves and Tortoise.</p><p> In the Igbo folktale narrated by Victor C. Uchendu, Tortoise was trying his best to avoid being the prey of the leopard by using all the weapons of the weak including patience, wisdom, sagacity, and cunning. As Uchendu tells us, one day, “at the height of a famine season, when all the animals were starving, the tortoise encountered a leopard that had been preying on other animals, a fact well known to the tortoise. As the tortoise was passing the leopard’s gate, he was invited to come in for kola nut. When the tortoise refused this hospitality, the following dialogue with the leopard began:</p><p> “Come in for kola nut, my dear friend,” requested the leopard.</p><p> “No thank you. Nobody eats my kola nuts at home,” replied tortoise. “Come in for a drink,” insisted the leopard.</p><p> “My liquor at home is growing sour for want of guests,” said the tortoise.</p><p> As the tortoise anticipated, the leopard hunted for him along the “clean” path while he moved safely through the grove path. The moral of this little tale is that the recipient of hospitality should have his wits about him. (Igbo of Southeast Nigeria, 72)</p><p> The verbal indirection that Tortoise uses in order to protect himself against the Leopard’s deviousness is parallel to the signifying oratory that Equiano employs in order to defend himself against his white oppressors. When a white man in St. Eustatius wanted his money back for a pig he had sold him, Equiano said: “Had the cruel man struck me I certainly should have defended myself at the hazard of my life; for what is life to a man thus oppressed?” (97). This statement suggests Equiano’s use of trickster language as a means for representing the powerlessness that he feels, just as Tortoise does when his life and humanity are endangered.</p><p> Equiano knew that his weapons of resistance needed to be subtle and mental, not physical. When he became legally free, he maximized his reliance on his wits by becoming a man of justice and peace who wanted to fight for the liberation of the enslaved Africans. Using the self-taught education he gained from his life experiences and from reading books such as the Bible and the Guide to the Indians, which he describes as “the two books I love above all others” (104), he challenged the servitude of blacks as antithetical to Western ideas of freedom. He writes: “I will not suppose that the dealers in slaves are born worded than other men—No; such is the fatality of this mistaken avarice that it corrupts the milk of human kindness and turns it into gall. And, had the pursuits of those men been different, they might have been as generous, as tender-hearted and just, as they are unfeeling, rapacious, and cruel” (99).</p><p> Equiano’s rhetoric against slavery illustrates the influence of Tortoise’s verbal dexterity and diplomacy in his resistance tactics. Tortoise’s influence is apparent in the adept word play that Equiano uses to reflect the dual intention of his oratory, which is to condemn slavery without alienating the support of “generous” white readers that he wanted as allies in his fight against slavery. Katalin Orban’s “Dominant and Submerged Discourses in The Life of Olaudah Equiano (or Gustavus Vassa?)” (1993) identifies the major challenges that Equiano and other African slave narrators faced in their attempt to express a genuine authorial voice to their audience. Orban says: “Their authorial freedom was complicated by a number of special concerns, such as their serious responsibilities to a community or the expectations of a likely audience. The most important complication is related to the fictional liberties the authors of slave narratives are (not) allowed to take” (655).</p><p> Having been raised in Igboland until he was eleven years old, Equiano was able to empower his complicated authorial voice. He retained in his writing the importance that the Igbo give to the use of rhetoric as a tool for helping an individual establish successful connections with others and survive in a community. Equiano reflects this tradition in many ways. First, from a linguistic point of view, he is the epitome of the gifted orator. As Robin Sabino and Jennifer Hall point out, the name “Olaudah” itself is traceable to either “Olaude,” which describes a “ring with a sonorous sound,” or “Ola-uda,” which identifies “a ring with a loud sound.” In Igbo, these words signify “vicissitude or fortunate; also, one favoured and having a loud voice and well spoken” (“Path Not Taken,” 13).</p><p> In addition to being an Igbo symbol of the loud sound, Equiano is also a figure of the black diasporan trope of the “Talking Book.” According to Gates, “the Talking Book” is the project in which black Atlantic writers attempt “to establish a collective black voice through the sublime example of an individual text” in which there is “a paradox of containing the oral within the written” (Pioneers, 4). The “Talking Book” is a radical black literary and intellectual tradition, because it also describes the continuous Pan-African canon of denunciation of injustices against blacks in which Equiano participated.</p><p> Because he was not allowed to have a voice in the West, Equiano used the trickster’s covert diplomacy in order to intersperse his feelings about Africa in a language in which he was attacking slavery and singing the benevolence of the abolitionists he admired. As Wilfred D. Samuels suggests, Equiano’s “anticipation of some negative response,” “his awareness of the importance of audience,” and his avoidance of censure led him “to assure his audience that his purpose throughout is not to offend or alienate” (64). In spite of his caution, Equiano was able to represent the predicament of slaves and depict his Igbo traditions positively and, thereby, resuscitate the silenced black voice in his narrative. This restoration of Equiano’s voice is crucial in the PanAfrican struggle against colonization. Discussing the import of Equiano’s new voice, Betsy Erkkila says, in “Ethnicity, Literary Theory, and the Grounds of Resistance” that “the unstopped black mouth, the black subject who thinks, speaks, writes, and creates back becomes integral to the process of transforming the black person’s material and symbolic status as ‘cargo,’ slave, and other within the imperialist narratives and representational practices of white EuroAmerican history” (576).</p><p> The significance of Equiano’s unsilenced black voice is apparent in the ways in which he uses it to show how slavery contradicted the invaluable notion of liberty in Western society. One example is when he prefaces a poem about his African homeland with a complaint about the injustice done to free blacks who are “thus villainously trepanned and held in bondage” (107). Right after this passage, Equiano directs his voice towards the Quaker abolitionists of Philadelphia whose “benevolence” has helped “many of the sable race, who now breathe the air of liberty” (107). Next, he emphasizes his Pan-Africanism when he says that black freedom will be uncertain till the day when the courts treat blacks as equals of whites, when there is evidence that the word “liberty” is not merely “nominal” but a reality (107). Following his strategic appeals to abolitionist support with a celebration of his homeland, he writes:</p><p> With thoughts like these, my anxious boding mind Recall’d those pleasing scenes I left behind;
Scenes, where fair liberty, in bright array,
Makes darkness bright, and e’en illumines day; Where, nor complexion, wealth, or station, can Protect the wretch who makes a slave of man. (107)</p><p> By romanticizing Igboland as an idyllic place with a “pleasing” and unforgettable landscape, Equiano attempts to create respect and recognition for his Igbo heritage in a Western world in which he perceived himself to be living only temporarily with the expectation of returning home. Anticipating the nationalist language that Du Bois and other black writers of the diaspora used some two hundred years later to describe parts of Africa, Equiano was then a pioneer in a black Atlantic literary tradition of representation of this continent as a land with civilizations equal to those of Europe. Equiano knew that if he returned to Essaka, his people would assess his experience in the West on the basis of his success or failure to bring back home what he learned from his journey.</p><p> In order to understand Equiano’s tight bonds with Africa, one should also interpret them in relation to the ontological and metaphysical realities of Igbo folktales. For example, in the folktale, “The Food Drum,” one can see the ways in which the Igbo individual values his community even when he/she is forced by incidental reasons to be far away from it. In the story, Mbe finds himself in a world far from his homeland where he had been asked to go to find the necessary food that could save his people from dying from the effects of a famine. In this story, Mbe considers himself as an agent who has been given the mission of bringing something specific to an Igbo community that prized the individual’s capacity to do good for the whole society. When he comes home with the magic drum that provides food when it is beaten, Mbe is welcomed with the utmost joy and pride of the people: “The square was crowded with people. Mbe made a long speech full of boasts about his adventures and told the hungry village he was going to feed them all.” Paradoxically, in “The Gift of Fire,” Mbe comes empty-handed from his journey and notices the silence of his people toward him. He receives no public recognition, not because he failed to bring food but because, after he flew to the land of Chukwu (God), he misbehaved toward the divine spirit. As the storyteller says, “When he got to Chukwu’s great gate, he knocked on the door and waited. There were no answers. Mbe became impatient and started to drum on the door. Then he heard a loud voice from the inside curse, ‘Let those hands that knock stick to the door.’ Mbe retorted angrily, ‘Let those words stick in your mouth.’ The gate remained closed. Mbe could not see Chukwu, so he returned emptyhanded.”</p><p> Mbe’s failure to fulfill the mission his community gave him is a situation that a self-conscious Igbo such as Equiano would have dreaded for obvious reasons, such as the fear of alienation and ridicule that awaits the person who disrespects Chukwu and fails to provide the nourishment he was expected to bring home. From this perspective, Equiano was very conscious of the responsibility that the individual Igbo has for his/her community. In “The Writer and His Community” (1984), Chinua Achebe describes the Igbo representation of the relations between the individual and the community as a dynamic in which the individual always subsumes his worth below that of the group (38–39). According to Achebe, the Igbo refuse the Western egocentric representation of the self that is epitomized by Renee Descartes’s “Cogito ergo sum. I think therefore I am!” (35) and “set about balancing this extraordinary specialness, this unsurpassed individuality, by setting limits to its expression. The first limit is the democratic one which subordinates the person to the group in practical, social matters. And the other is a moral taboo on excess which sets a limit to personal ambition, surrounding it with powerful cautionary tales” (39). Achebe’s remarks corroborate the significance of the subordination of the individual’s will to that of the community, which is salient in the worldviews of both Equiano and Mbe.</p><p> Furthermore, Equiano appropriates Igbo tradition by playing the role of diviner, discarder of omen, and protector of societal values that the oracle in Igbo society plays. This oracle is the religious institution that preserves the relationships between the land of the living and the land of ancestors and of Chukwu (God) through constant communication. Each Igbo subgroup has an oracle. Uchendu explains: “The common characteristics of the Igbo oracles are their secret operations, the institutionalization of an ‘intelligence service’ and the attraction of clients through a chain of contact agents. Their geographical locations indicate a regional influence or sphere of authority” (100). A central part of the oracle is the blend of oratory and diplomatic skills that the Dibia [diviner], who mediates the relationships between the intertwined worlds of the living, ancestors, and God, employs. Another key element of the oracle is the mixture of religious and secular rationality that the Dibia exhibits in his conception of the power of God. In this worldview, God is both a powerful being to fear and a personable deity to whom the individual can relate on reciprocal terms. Uchendu writes: “The Igbo attitude toward the gods is not one of fear but one of friendship, a friendship that lasts as long as the reciprocal obligations are kept. This contractual quality in the man-spirit relationship is based on the recognition of the inadequacy of either party. Only the high god is self-sufficient. Nowhere is the contractual relationship between man and spirit better illustrated than in the Igbo attitude toward the ancestors” (101).</p><p> The Igbo concept of a personable “high god” is apparent in The Igbo Roots of Olaudah Equiano where Acholonu suggests how some Igbo represent Chukwu as “the Big God in the Sky” who smokes as the people do (75). In his narrative, Equiano represents his Igbo God as the “Creator of all things” who “lives in the sun” and “smokes a pipe, which is our favorite luxury” (41). The image of a divinity who likes the same things that human beings enjoy attests to the Igbo’s view of God as a pleasant and casual deity. The Igbo perception of God as a personable spirit is also evident in what the Igwe of Orlu tells Acholonu, “Glory be to God on the Highest, and on earth, peace to men of goodwill” (168). The Igwe of Orlu also tells Acholonu, “You have unravelled what has baffled the ancient gods” (173), which is a statement that refers to the history and fate of Equiano (173). These quotations underscore the Igbo’s belief in the capacity of human beings to intrude in the divine realm and resolve mysteries for their people. Yet the Igbo people’s ability to enter the divine sphere and resolve problems depends on their continual relationships with God and ancestors. This permanent intimacy between people and sacred spirits is suggested in Acholonu’s argument that in Equiano’s homeland (Esseke), “There is a continuity between the past and present generations; between the past and the present, the present and the future, the dead and the living” (40). Acholonu’s assertion emphasizes the Igbo’s continuous ties with their reachable ancestors and gods who shape their lives and customs.</p><p> The notion of personable and accessible gods and ancestors who give people the power to do social good is an Igbo ideology that Equiano blends harmoniously with his Western Christian worldview. The Pan-African influence in his cosmology is noticeable in the ways in which he appropriates the Dibia’s rhetorical skills to preach for the end of the slave trade to a Western audience that he knew was as religious as the Igbo in Essaka were. In an attempt to convince readers of the inhumanness of slavery, he uses the imagery of human beings that society has corrupted by taking them from their homeland and bringing them into a world in which stratifications based on race and social status had replaced individual freedom.</p><p> From the moment he gains his freedom (121), Equiano becomes a Christlike figure who talks about the importance of atonement for one’s sins. Looking at the waving water from the deck of a ship, he says: “All my sins stared me in the face; and, especially, I thought that God had hurled his direct vengeance on my guilty head for cursing the vessel on which my life depended. My spirits at this forsook me, and I expected every moment to go to the bottom. I determined if I should still be saved, that I would never swear again” (127). In this passage, he is using the genre of spiritual autobiography in order to talk about his own sin. Yet because his rhetoric appropriates the verbal ambiguity of both Mbe and the Dibia, Equiano’s reference to his sin also signifies the whites’ necessity to acknowledge the transgressions they committed against God by enslaving other human beings. Equiano’s allusion to such sins is possible, because his words have a double meaning and direction that allow him to attack slaveowners implicitly without making himself vulnerable to their violence.</p><p> In addition, Equiano’s narrative is distinguished by its ambivalent representation of Africa. On the one hand, Equiano was attracted to an Africa that he romanticized in order to show his nostalgia for his homeland. On the other hand, he was repulsed by an Africa that he vituperated in Eurocentric and ethnocentric terms in order to reveal his occasional lack of longing for his ancestral home. His duality toward Africa is traceable to the Igbo tricksters’ shifting attitudes about life.
One positive representation of Africa in Equiano’s book is the stanza from “Miscellaneous Verses” that describes the narrator’s sorrow about his bondage. This section invokes the image of the free and innocent African person who was snatched from his/her homeland. Equiano writes:</p><p> Unhappy more than some on earth,
I thought the place that gave me birth— Strange thoughts oppress’d—while I replied “Why not in Ethiopia died?”
And why thus spar’d when nigh to hell?— God only knew—I could not tell!
“A tott’ring fence a bowing wall,”
“I thought myself ere since the fall.” (163)</p><p> This poem reveals Equiano’s agony that he had been taken from his African homeland and brought into a world where misery and oppression compromised a freedom he could only dream of. The poem resonates with sentiments that Wheatley expressed in “To The Right Honourable William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth,” published in Boston on October 10, 1772, where she describes her love for freedom as stemming</p><p> From native Clime, when seeming cruel Fate
Me snatch’d from Afric’s fancy’d happy Seat, Impetuous—Ah! what bitter Pangs molest,
What Sorrows labour’d in the Parent Breast?
That, more than Stone, ne’er soft Compassion mov’d, Who from its Father seiz’d his much belov’d. (218)</p><p> Both writers describe the heavy and immeasurable price they paid for having been snatched from Africa and oppressed through captivity, confinement, and what Equiano summarizes as a descent into “hell” and which Wheatley synopsizes as a “cruel Fate.” The two authors convey, through their “Talking Book,” the horror that slavery brought into their personal and collective lives. Equiano, like Wheatley and Cugoano, was, then, a pioneer black Atlantic writer.</p><p> Equiano’s ambivalence toward Africa is traceable to Igbo folklore in which duality is a common theme. A representation of doubleness in Igbo folklore is the tale “Usu (the Bat)” in which the protagonist allies himself with both birds and other animals for protection. As the storyteller says, “When, [during] the winged race, the birds appeared to be winning, Usu moved to their sides.” In response to the birds’ victory, “the animals regrouped and pulled down all the trees in the world, thus forcing the birds to remain constantly in flight. They had nowhere to perch. At this stage, Usu joined the animals.”22 The moral of this story is the belief in the inseparability of dual entities or qualities of life such as good/bad, tall/short, and beautiful/ugly that Western discourse categorizes. In Toward an Igbo Metaphysics (1985), Emmanuel M. P. Edeh explains the Igbo theory of duality as the idea that “for all beings in the material universe, existence is a dual and interrelated phenomenon. Whatever exists in a sensible form in this world does not exist solely in this way. It has a dual existence, dual in the sense that the reality of its existence is a phenomenon in the visible world and also a reality in the invisible world” (77). The Igbo theory of duality helps us explain the frequent change in Equiano’s perception of Africa in ambivalent ways. Like Usu, Equiano pretends to be neutral when he visibly casts very critical eyes on Africa as if he does not want to reconnect with his homeland. Yet, at the same time, he is noticeably appreciative of Africa and wants to renew ties with his native land. It is therefore impossible to interpret Equiano’s relations with Africa in monolithic ways, since his memory of cultural practices and political values in his homeland is ambivalent. Equiano’s ambivalence toward Africa is an early sign of the “double-consciousness,” or the intricate attempt of black Atlantic writers to blend their African and Western selves that Gruesser identifies in Black on Black (2000) as a major characteristic of twentieth-century African American literature (21–22).</p><p> Equiano’s representation of African culture was influenced by his disappointment and reproachful attitudes toward Africans whose involvement in his captivity he could neither understand nor pardon. Referring to Richard (Dick) Baker and his other white friends and shipmates, he states: “From what I could understand by him of this God, and seeing these white people did not sell one another as we did, I was pleased; and in this I thought they were much happier than we Africans” (63). Equiano’s criticism of African culture was, therefore, influenced by his disillusionment with Africans’ participation in his captivity.</p><p> Equiano’s duality toward Africa is not permanent since he is able to look back to Africa in order to transcend the confusion that slavery created in his life. As F. Abiola Irele points out in The African Imagination: Literature in Africa and the Black Diaspora (2001), Equiano recovers from his anxieties by reversing the language of Western misrepresentation of Africans, “which he is able to grasp as a function both of his essential human condition and of his African antecedents” (48). This self-recovery allows Equiano to transcend his grudge toward Africans by his romantic celebration of his homeland of Essaka, where mostly his mother reared him and where matriarchy has a different meaning than that which applies to Western women.24 For the sake of avoiding the pitfalls of Western feminist interpretations, which, as Filomina Chioma Steady argues, “have often been projections of male/female antagonisms that derive from Western middle-class experiences” with “very little concern shown for the oppression by world economic systems on African men as well as women” (“Black Women Cross-Culturally,” 28), it is imperative to understand the complex matrilineal gender and class-based structures of the Igbo society from which Equiano came. In Igbo society, women have social and economic means that put them in egalitarian and complimentary relationships with men. In Igbo Roots of Olaudah Equiano, Acholonu records the statement of Egwuatu Onwuezike about the important status of women in traditional Igbo society in Esseke: “Our women, according to the stories we were told, were very cooperative. If the men were returning from war, the women would join together and go to meet them rejoicing. Also according to the stories we heard, if there was war in our village or town, our women would join forces with the men and go to war . . . if they stayed home they would still give their support to the men” (71–72). In a similar vein, Equiano gives a list of activities in which women in Essaka have absolute control. For instance, before a wedding, the relatives of both the bridegroom and the bride give a dowry that “generally consists of portions of land, slaves, and cattle, household goods, and implements of husbandry” (35).</p><p> Moreover, as Equiano suggests, in Essaka women are involved in economic transactions that require them to travel long distances, as evident in the case of the woman who helped two men capture Equiano and her sister and sell the siblings to a “chieftain” “in a very pleasant country” (48). This instance suggests the important economic and social role Igbo women have as forces that guarantee the well-being of their community by working in both external and internal spheres of life. In Male Daughters, Female Husbands: Gender and Sex in an African Society (1987), Ifi Amadiume says that Igbo women “could combine power derived from their control of subsistence farming and family sustenance, as they were the food producers and crop growers” and “their organizational ability, for effective mass action against a particular village or all the village group, until their demands were met” (182). According to Amadiume, these elements show that Igbo women’s “strong economic position made up for their lack of formal political authority” (182).</p><p> Later, Equiano tells us that he was sold to a wealthy widow he later saw at a town he calls Tinmah (51). The editor of Equiano’s narrative, Robert J. Allison, says that the town may be Utuma, Utu Etim, or Tinan, which are villages located between Ibo and Ibibio (51). In fact, it is also possible that the town Equiano calls Tinmah refers to the region in Central Sierra Leone where the Temne (Atemne or Timne) people lived. In Senegambia and the Atlantic Slave Trade (1998), Boubacar Barry describes the Temne territory as one of the Southern Rivers regions of West Africa that also included Susu, Bullam, and Baga, where large numbers of slaves (about 70 percent of the population of these regions) caught from the hinterlands were concentrated (122). The region was located on the route from the land of the Igbo in southeast Nigeria to the Guinea coast where Equiano would have been taken for sale into the Americas. It is then probable that the wealthy widow Equiano mentions identifies the prosperous class of African women traders whose functions in striving local and transatlantic networks of slave commerce have been examined by Lillian Ashcraft-Eason (“She Voluntarily Hath Come,” 202–21).</p><p> The women Equiano describes also have power in the arena of sexuality. On his forced journey to the African west coast, Equiano describes a country where “women were not so modest as ours [in Essaka], for they ate, and drank, and slept with their men” (52). The sexual freedom is in contrast with the sexual restraint in Essaka (39), but it fits into the general pattern of equal roles between genders that exists in Equiano’s community, especially in aspects of resistance against enemy invaders. He writes: “Even our women are warriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole district is a kind of a militia: on a certain signal given, such as the firing of a gun at night, they all rise in arms and rush upon their enemy. It is perhaps something remarkable, that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them” (40). The striking element in Equiano’s description of Igbo women is the complementary nature of their work and the important role these women played in the maintenance of the peace and order of their society. Rather than being the alleged victims of African men that Western scholars perceive them to be, women in Igbo society were strong and worked in harmonious ways with their men for the development of the community. In “Gender Question in Igbo Politics” (1993), U. D. Anyanwu says: “Men and women had specific roles but these were complementary. Men generally were the leaders or heads at all levels of the Igbo political structure. Women did not have equal access to power and authority with men. Yet women were not second-class citizens” (119). Anyanwu’s statement contradicts the Western critics’ tendency to represent gender relations in Igbo society in terms of antinomies between the discrete power of men and women.</p><p> Equiano also represents Africa through his depiction of Essaka as a place where artistic talent and creativity flourished. He states: “We are almost a nation of dancers, musicians, and poets. Thus every great event, such as a triumphant return from a battle or other cause of public rejoicing, is celebrated in public dances, which are accompanied with songs and music suited to the occasion” (36). Here, Equiano affirms his pride in an African tradition that he could remember so vividly in the West. His depiction of the inhabitants of Essaka as happy and sophisticated people registers his African consciousness and stands as a big contract to Wheatley’s early misrepresentation of Africans as “Pagans.” In this sense, one may agree with Femi Ojo Ade’s argument that the experience of being in the West did not lead Equiano to neglect his African heritage (4).</p><p> Equiano’s remembrance of African culture is also evident in his description of the allocation of space in his homeland according to gender and marital status. He tells us that in Essaka, men and women sleep separately unless they are married. The male-head of the family “has a large square piece of ground, surrounded with a moat or fence” (37). In the middle of the house stands a “principal building” [Obi] that is “appropriated to the sole use of the master consisting of two apartments” (37). He also tells us that the head of the family has “a distinct apartment in which he sleeps, together with his male children” (37). This housing-system reflects the gendered-structure of traditional African families. Opposing common stereotypes, he acknowledges the relative power and privilege that women have in the African family. As he points out, on either side of the husband’s principal building, “are the apartments of his wives, who have also their separate day and night houses” (37). This detailed description of his traditional home and of the privilege that women have in Essaka attests Equiano’s respect for his African village and tradition.</p><p> Equiano’s deference for African culture is also noticeable in his portrayal of the rituals such as totemism, animal sacrifices, and ancestor worships that were practiced in Essaka. He writes: “the day on which the sun crosses the line [the equator]” is the time when “the greatest offerings are made” in Essaka (41). The day when the sun crosses the equator is also the time when “any young animals are killed” as sacrifices for the spiritual health of the community (41). These statements suggest the importance of animal sacrifices in Igbo culture, where animals serve as intermediaries between the living and the spirits of ancestors and deities, the latter being the most frequent beneficiaries of these offerings. As John E. E. Njoku points out in “The Igbos of Nigeria,” while in many Afri can countries “sacrifice” means offerings made to spirits, in Igboland the word signifies offerings made to either Chukwu (God) or Ekwensy (Devil), who are both considered as “too high on the scale of being to be the recipients of any sacrificial offering,” since they are “the master spirits of good and evil, with little time or inclinations to bother about petty humans” (76). Njoku’s assertion reveals the Igbo opposition of the Western conception of the world as constituted of unconnected “good” or “evil” resources out of which one chooses only one. By blurring the boundaries between “good” and “evil,” Igbo culture provided Equiano with a flexible worldview and a concept of morality that allowed him to maneuver his struggle for freedom in the West successfully.</p><p> In an attempt to create respect for Africa and Africans in the West, Equiano rejects racial and cultural stereotypes and dichotomies. Combining the African bard’s practice of oracling with philosophy, he presents various theories, which are antecedents of the Jewish hypothesis of Igbo origin.25 As David Ihenacho argues in African Christianity Rises: A Critical Study of the Catholicism of the Igbo People of Nigeria (2004), this theory holds that “like most other epithets in the Hebrew culture, the term Igbo was an epithet of an ancient Jewish city or deity that became independent as an Igbo clan that splintered off and migrated southwards across the Sahara Desert to the area of equatorial Africa. According to this strand of Igbo scholarship, the former nomadic Igbo tribe finally settled in Southern Nigeria where it shed its nomadic culture for a more sedentary lifestyle encouraged by its new tropical habitation” (6–7). As Ihenacho contends, this hypothesis continues Equiano’s theory that “the Igbo ancestry is Jewish in origin” (6). In his narrative, Equiano develops a similar idea when he argues that the cultures of the Igbo and the Jews are similar. He explains that rituals such as circumcising children or naming them from some event or circumstance are practiced in the cultures of both the Igbo and the Jews (42). Later, he contends that the Igbo and the Jews share the use of ablution for physical and spiritual cleanliness (42).</p><p> Equiano’s intercultural theories help him demonstrate that the Igbo and the Jews have a common origin. He tells us that, according to an eighteenthcentury European physician known as Dr. Gill, “the Africans [come] from Afer and Afra, [and are] the descendents of Abraham by Keturah his wife and concubine” (44). Gill’s theory, he continues, “alone would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the other” (44). His analogy between the Igbo and the Jews reveals his attempt to show that Africans are descendants of the same Judeo-Christian heritage to which many Europeans trace their religious beliefs. By locating the ancestors of the Igbo among the offspring of Abraham, Equiano wants to demonstrate the ancient nature of African people and civilizations in an attempt to create admissibility and respect for them in the New World. In this sense, Equiano’s theory of the Jewish origin of the Igbo helps him subvert the racist representation of Africans as inferior to Europeans. As Adam Potkay and Sandra Burr argue in Black Atlantic Writers of the Eighteenth Century (1995), Equiano’s theory of race and culture “runs contrary to the common (though fantastic) taunt that blacks are the cursed descendants of Ham who are ordained to serve God’s chosen people—here, white Europeans—as slaves” (12). Equiano’s representation of himself as the product of an African culture that was influenced by Jewish tradition exposes a radical change in his perception of his African identity in the West. In representing his racial and cultural background as a hybrid blend of African and Jewish elements, he undermines the notion of pure African identity.</p><p> Equiano’s perception of his racial identity as hybrid is also visible in how he later prefers to be seen as white rather than as black. In the fourth chapter of the Narrative, he describes the moment when he wanted to be white. Referring to Mary, who was the daughter of an Englishman in Guernsey, South Great Britain, he states: “I had often observed that when her mother washed her face it looked very rosy, but when she washed mine it did not look so. I therefore tried oftentimes myself if I could not by washing make my face of the same color as my little play-mate, Mary, but it was all in vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our complexions” (64). Equiano’s belief that he could wash off the color of his face attests a desire to be assimilated into a European culture in which one’s ability to pass as white was a key to gaining social admissibility and political and economic success. Ironically, his use of “passing” is damaging, since it leads him to question his relationships with Africa. As Jesús Benito and Ana Manzanas argue in a 1999 study of Equiano’s shifting identities in the Western world, “Equiano seems to forget that whiteness for the African equates ‘otherness’ ” (50).</p><p> Another major theme in Equiano’s Narrative is his involvement in the black emigration project. This idea germinated in England as a result of anxieties about the presence of blacks in England during the early seventeenth century, when, according to Lewis K. Gordon, the Elizabethan royal proclamation of 1601 complained about the high number of “Negroes and blackamoors” in the kingdom (21). To alienate these blacks, the British government proposed their deportation as a remedy at a time when “a noticeable black community had settled itself in Shakespeare’s London, immediately occasioned by the royal encouragement of the triangular trade with West Africa and the new American lands and the return of absentee planters with their retinues of black retainers” (21).
 Despite the racism they experienced, blacks in London received a degree of acceptance from the white abolitionist sympathizers such as Lord Chief Justice Mansfield and Granville Sharp. Mansfield settled the infamous Somersett Case of 1772 in favor of blacks. The case was about a slave named James Somersett that a planter wanted to return to Jamaica chained in irons. Lord Mansfield ruled that despite his proprietary claims, the master could not force James to leave England. In “Black Writers of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries” (1985), Paul Edwards asserts: “By 1701, an Englishman making his will could write of his black servant, ‘I take him to be in the nature of my goods and chattels.’ There were critical voices to be heard, but no serious focus of protest until the 1760s when Granville Sharp won a series of cases against slave-owners in Britain, culminating in Lord Chief Justice Mansfield’s ruling of 1772 in the Somerset case that black servants in Britain had the right to refuse to return to service—that is, to slavery—in the Americas” (51). The Somersett case dealt a heavy blow to the interest of slavery advocates while giving blacks a significant, though unclear, legal status in Britain. As James Walvin contends, the Somersett case brought a beacon of hope to blacks in England who “bowed with profound respect to the judges, and shaking each other by the hand, congratulated themselves upon the recovery of the rights of human nature” (112).26</p><p> A pivotal change occurred in the aftermath of the Somersett case when English abolitionist lawyer Granville Sharp, who was a friend of both Cugoano and Equiano, took advantage of Mansfield’s ruling to argue that slaves were free once they set foot on English soil. Though it was equally significant for blacks, Sharp’s argument was somewhat compromised by the institutional racism in Britain. According to Helena Woodward, despite his support for blacks, Sharp knew that “ ‘the Crown and the nobles—and the monied interests—and the church and the bench and the bar’ consolidated to preserve an ideology of racial inferiority to protect slavery” (40). This institutional racism did not prevent Sharp from continuing to support the Anti-Slavery movement, especially when Equiano and Cugoano asked him to help black servants in England avoid deportation to the Caribbean (53).</p><p> Equiano was aware of the quagmire that the English faced when they did not know what to do with poor blacks in England. In an attempt to overcome this dilemma, Equiano was determined to help these blacks migrate to Africa. He strongly wanted to go to Africa to serve as a missionary. He dreamed of serving as an officer of the “select committee of gentlemen for the black poor,” whose humanitarian goals he espoused at first (187). Equiano was a major witness of the British government’s plan to emigrate these blacks to Sierra Leone. Equiano writes: “On my return to London in August [1786], I was very agreeably surprised to find that the benevolence of government had adopted the plan of some philanthropic individuals, to send the Africans from hence to their native quarter; and that some vessels were then engaged to carry them to Sierra Leone, an act which redounded to the horror of all concerned in its promotion, and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing” (187). The emigration project had a few ill intentions that Equiano understood but could not disclaim immediately. The risk of being carried in ships where slavery was practiced and the likelihood of being resold into slavery, as was current in the late eighteenth century, repulsed Equiano and distanced him from a project he perceived as a secret plan to rid England of its black leadership. In his introduction to Equiano’s narrative, Carretta argues that the ending of the first editions of Equiano’s book was “where the genre of apologia, or justification and vindication of one’s life, shows its influence. Having been accused in the newspapers by powerful opponents of having mismanaged his position as Commissary for the Sierra Leone project, Equiano defends himself with witnesses and evidence” (xxiv).</p><p> In his narrative, Equiano tells us that he resigned from the position of Commissary for the Sierra Leone Project because he had witnessed “flagrant abuses” committed by an agent of the British government whom he charged for the loss of 750 slops (necessaries) that were needed for 750 persons (188). Yet, though he quit his position of appointed Commissary, Equiano remained interested in the African trip and learned with disillusionment about its setbacks. He asserts: “Thus ended my part of the long talked of expedition to Sierra Leone; an expedition which, however unfortunate in the event, was humane and politic in its design, nor was its failure owing to government; everything was done on their part; but there was evidently sufficient mismanagement attending the conduct and execution of it to defeat its success” (189). The legitimate reasons for Equiano’s resignation from the position of Commissary of the Sierra Leone Project include the fear of racism and exploitation of his public status and intellect that he had, especially when emigrationist projects were designed with cruel policies that gave little power to the black elite that was expected to carry them out.</p><p> Equiano’s narrative reflects his ability to use trickster strategies and other covert tools of resistance in order to justify the liberation of slaves from their oppressive masters. He used Igbo folklore constructively in an attempt to demonstrate the humanity of the African slaves and demand the end of their bondage. In addition, his account shows his capacity to participate in the intellectual debates about race and slavery in the West. His own experiences with
 slavery and racism, and his familiarity with European writings that demonized blacks, allowed him to identify and confront racist theories about Africans.</p><p> Moreover, Equiano’s book reveals his dualistic relationships with Africa. While he is occasionally ambivalent toward certain parts of his Igbo customs and the participation of some Africans in the enslavement of other blacks, he never shatters the core of his Igbo identity and his respect for the customs and values of his homeland. Yet his Igbo identity does not prevent him from embracing European Christianity, creating alliances with free-minded Western abolitionists, and affirming connections between the Jews and the Igbo. In this sense, he developed a Pan-Africanism that allowed him to gain a legitimate space in Western culture and promote his Igbo tradition at the same time.</p><p>
