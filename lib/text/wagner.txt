Slaves learned to survive by imitating the trickster and using deception to overcome the strength of their masters. The tar baby showed that culture not only survived but thrived under slavery, and it showed that culture’s purpose under slavery was practical, and even political, as stories like the tar baby taught slaves how to push back against their masters.</p><p> Oral traditions do not leave dated traces, which means it is impossible to reconstruct a story’s movement based on the mere fact of its existence in more than one place.</p><p> Interpreted in this broader comparative context, the tar baby looks less like an ethnographic example and more like a universal history that seeks to grasp all at once the interlocking processes by which custom was criminalised, lands were colonised, slaves were captured, and labor was bought and sold, even as it also meditates on the feeling of disenchantment and the impact of science on the conflict over natural resources. We should understand the tar baby, in other words, not only as an artifact of globalization but also as an account of globalization whose scale of reference matches the scale of its diffusion.
