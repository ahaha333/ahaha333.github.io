…the field of African diaspora studies is largely framed by the Atlantic model in which the patterns of dispersal are reduced to the slave trade and the processes of diasporization to racialization. </p><p> Analytically, a continental perspective incorporating North Africa and South Africa helps decentre the ‘Black Atlantic’ perspective, both in its spatial and racial preoccupations with the Atlantic world and ‘blackness’ in so far as African scholars from northern Africa and among those of Asian and European descent in South Africa may not be preoccupied with ‘blackness’, thereby freeing studies and discourses of African diasporas from their racialized trope and trap. </p><p> Diaspora, I would suggest, simultaneously refers to a process, a condition, a space, and a discourse; the continuous processes by which a diaspora is made, unmade and remade, the changing conditions in which it lives and expresses itself, the places where it is moulded and imagined, and the contentious ways in which it is studied and discussed. It entails a culture and a consciousness, sometimes diffuse and sometime concentrated of a ‘here’ separate from a ‘there’, a ‘here’ that is often characterized by a regime of marginalization and a ‘there’ that is invoked as a rhetoric of self-affirmation, of belonging to ‘here’ differently. The emotional and experiential investment in ‘here’ and ‘there’ and the points in between, indeed in the very configurations and imaginings of ‘here’ and ‘there’ and their complex intersections obviously change in response to the shifting materialities, mentalities, and moralities of social existence. </p><p> Diaspora is simultaneously a state of being and a process of becoming, a kind of voyage that encompasses the possibility of never arriving or returning, a navigation of multiple belongings, of networks of affiliation. It is a mode of naming, remembering, living and feeling group identity moulded out of experiences, positionings, struggles, and imaginings of the past and the present, and at times the unfolding, unpredictable future, which are shared or seen to be shared across the boundaries of time and space that frame ‘indigenous’ identities in the contested and constructed locations of ‘there’ and ‘here’ and the passages and points in between. </p><p> In a broad sense, a diasporic identity implies a form of group consciousness constituted historically through expressive culture, politics, thought and tradition, in which experiential and representational resources are mobilized, in varied measures, from the imaginaries of both the old and the new worlds. Diasporas are complex social and cultural communities created out of real and imagined genealogies and geographies (cultural, racial, ethnic, national, continental, transnational) of belonging, displacement, and recreation, constructed and conceived at multiple temporal and spatial scales, at different moments and distances from the putative homeland. A diaspora is fashioned as much in the fluid and messy contexts of social experience, differentiation and struggle, and through the transnational circuits of exchange of diasporic resources and repertoires of power, as in the discourses of the intellectuals and political elites. </p><p> As we all know the name ‘Africa’ is not African; it originally referred to the Roman province in present-day Tunisia, and only later was it extended to the whole continent, and much later still did the various peoples of the continent come to be referred to, or to refer to themselves as Africans; some still don’t. Thus, exclusive claims to Africa based on the sands of the Sahara or doses of melanin represent the spatialization and racialization of African identity that are historically spurious. </p><p> One unfortunate result of the Atlantic model is the tendency to reduce all historic African diasporas to the dispersals of slavery and to blacks. To use Robin Cohen’s  typology, African diasporas are often seen as victim diasporas (in Cohen’s schema the others are labour, trade, and cultural diasporas). This tends to freeze African diaspora history, homogenize African diasporas, and racialize them exclusively as black. </p><p> Hunwick and Powell have argued that in the Mediterranean lands of Islam religious precepts prevented the emergence of the racialized voice of ‘black consciousness’ even among enslaved Africans. </p><p> …the imperatives of racialized slavery and later segregation ensured the differentiation and distancing essential to the formation and reproduction of diasporic identities. (10-11)</p><p> By the beginning of the nineteenth century more Africans had come to the Americas than Europeans, which has led Sheila Walker  to contest the conceptualization of America as a European construct, as some kind of Eurogenic creation, and to restore the African and African diasporic contributions to their rightful place. ‘For more than three hundred years of the five-hundred year modern history of the Americas’, she writes, ‘Africans and their descendants were the Americas’ largest population. Therefore, the demographic foundation of the Americas was African, not European ... In the necessary process of re-creating themselves in their new milieu, these Diasporan Africans invented and participated in the inventing of new cultural forms such as languages, religions, foods, aesthetic expressions, and political and social organizations.’   </p><p> See: Walker, Sheila S., 2001, ‘Introduction: Are You Hip to the Jive? (Re)Writing/Righting the Pan- American Discourse’, in Sheila S. Walker, ed., African Roots/American Cultures: Africa in the Creation of the Americas. New York: Rowan and Littlefield, 1-44. </p><p> The ‘new’ or ‘contemporary’ African diasporas:</p><p> The diasporas of colonization would include the students who went to study abroad and stayed, seamen who became settlers, and many other others who could migrate and become citizens according to the prevailing immigration regimes in the host country. The diasporas of decolonization include besides the so-called ‘indigenous’ Africans, European and Asian settlers, who relocated overseas during the struggles for independence and immediately after. The diasporas of structural adjustment have been formed since the 1980s out of the migrations engendered by economic, political, and social crises and the destabilizations of SAPs. They include professional elites, traders, refugees, and students. </p><p> …Like the other regions in global South – Asia, Latin American and the Caribbean and Oceania – Africa’s share of the world’s migrant stock declined from 12.1 percent in 1960 to 9 percent in 2005. There was also a decline in the share of migrants in the African population, from 3.2 percent to 1.9 percent. </p><p> By 2005 there were approximately 1.5 million African-born residents in the United States, up from 700,000 in 2000, 363,819 in 1990, 199,723 in 1980, 35,355 in 1960, 18,326 in 1930, 2,538 in 1900, and 551 in 1850. </p><p> Quite literally, the postcolonial migrants from Africa to the US owe their fortunes to the doors opened by African American struggles. </p><p> The past is of course a moving location. </p><p> Two critical questions can be raised. First, how do the different African diasporas remember, imagine, and engage Africa, and which Africa – in temporal and spatial terms? Second, how does Africa, or rather the different Africas – in their temporal and spatial framings – remember, imagine, and engage their diasporas? Given the complex ebbs and flows of history, for Africa itself and the various regional hostlands of the African diasporas, it stands to reason that the engagements between Africa and its diasporas have been built and shaped by continuities, changes, and ruptures. </p><p> The fluidity of these engagements is best captured by the notion of flow, that flows of several kinds and levels of intensity characterize the linkages between the homeland and the diaspora. The diaspora or the homeland can serve as a signifier for the other subject to strategic manipulation. The flows include people, cultural practices, productive resources, organizations and movements, ideologies and ideas, images and representations. In short, we can isolate six major flows: demographic flows, cultural flows, economic flows, political flows, ideological flows, and iconographic flows. (16 – 17)</p><p> Iconographic flows refer to images and visual representations of Africa, Africanness and blackness that are created, circulated, and consumed through art works and the media. As Nkiru Nzegwu  has demonstrated, transatlantic artistic dialogue has been continuous and intensified over the last half century, sustained and reproduced by the travels of artists, a shared visual language, and invocations of cultural memories and artistic motifs. ‘Because the socio-economic conditions under which these artists create activates psychic vortices’, she writes, ‘art-making becomes a ritual in which cultural genealogy is revitalized, new realities are constructed, and new identities are announced’. African American iconographic constructions of diasporan identity and black modernity have been particularly influential, thanks in part to the global tentacles of the American state and capital, on whose corporate media and imperial wings they have been exported to the rest of the world. Examples include appropriations of African American cultural identity by British blacks during the Second World War, and of political blackness by the oppressed peoples of South Africa in the late 1960s. For their part the new African diasporas have been simultaneously recycling old and reinventing new iconographies of Africa and Africaness. Examples include the Senegalese traders selling the monolithic Africa of Afrocentricity, and the imports of Nollywood films by new African diasporas hungry for modernist self- representation. </p><p> The demographic flows are self-evident. Almost from the beginning to the present, the traffic of people from Africa to the Americas has never been one way; some have returned from the diaspora to the continent, whether permanently or temporarily, and through them contacts and memories between the diasporas and the continent have been kept alive, and vibrant cultural exchanges maintained. </p><p> We need to transcend the question of African cultural retentions and survivals in the diaspora, to examine not only the traffic of cultural practices from the diasporas to various parts of Africa, but also the complex patterns and processes of current cultural exchanges through the media of contemporary globalization from television and cinema to video and the Internet. </p><p> Gerhard Kubik  provides a useful typology that divides the interpretive schemes of diaspora cultures into six categories; what he calls, first, biological reductionism, second, socio-psychological determinism, third, pseudo- historical reductionism, fourth, historical particularism, fifth, cultural materialism, and sixth cultural diffusionism. It stands to reason that all these elements, the imagined ontologies of blackness, constructions of racial hierarchies, selective appropriations of African memories and alterity, material imperatives of cultural change, and the diffusionist trails of cultural transfer, have played a role in the development of diaspora cultures as distinctive cultures marked by similarities, differences, parallels, connections and exchanges with the numerous cultures of continental Africa. The communication and circulation of cultural practices and paradigms between Africa and its diasporas have encompassed religion, education, literature, art, and music, to mention a few. These flows have constituted, I would argue, an essential part of Africa’s modernities, globalization, transnationalism, and cosmopolitanism.
